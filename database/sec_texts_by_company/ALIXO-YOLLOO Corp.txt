Results of Operations
for the years ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024:
Revenues
For the years ended February 28, 2025 and February
29, 2024, the Company generated total revenue of $37,760 having sold the Application Programming Interface (API) packages provided on
its website and $21,518, respectively. The Company's revenue increased by $16,242, or 75%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to
an overall increase in business activity and an expanded customer base.
7
Operating expenses
Total expenses for the year ended February 28, 2025
were $60,418 ($27,422 for the year ended February 29, 2024) consisting of general and administrative expenses. Expenses increased by $32,996,
or 120%, for the year ended February 28, 2025, primarily driven by marketing expenses and software development expenses, reflecting the
Company's strategic focus on growth.
Other Income (Expenses)
Total other expenses for
the years ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024 was $0 and $867, respectively. The other expenses included the loss on sale of
the intangible asset.
Net Losses
The company recorded a net loss of $22,658 for the
year ended February 28, 2025, and $6,771 for the year ended February 29, 2024. Despite the increase in revenue, the Company reported a
net loss for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2025, as the growth of operating expenses exceeded the growth of revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of February 28, 2025 we
have cash reserves of approximately $13,861 ($9,073 as of February 29, 2024) and our liabilities are $111,064 ($79,998 as of February
29, 2024), comprising $27,150 accounts payable ($43,648 as of February 29, 2024), $10,880 deferred revenue ($0 as of February 29, 2024)
and $73,034 ($36,350 as of February 29, 2024) owed to Rassul Sadakbayev, our director. The available capital reserves of the Company are
not sufficient for the Company to remain operational.
Shareholders’ equity has decreased from $28,058
as of February 29, 2024 to $5,400 as of February 28, 2025.
The Company has accumulated a deficit of $33,500 as
of February 28, 2025, compared to $10,842 as of February 29, 2024, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.
Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year
ended February 28, 2025, was $23,504 ($62,308 – for the year ended February 29, 2024). The Company moved from cash outflow to positive
cash inflow, indicating an improvement in its ability to generate cash from its core business operations.
Cash flows from investing activities for the year
ended February 28, 2025, was $55,400 ($10,000 - for the year ended February 29, 2024). The shift in investing activities indicated investment
in long-term intangible assets.
Cash flows from financing activities for the year
ended February 28, 2025, was $36,684 ($53,870 - for the year ended February 29, 2024). Financing activities showed an increase in cash
inflows due to additional funds under a loan agreement with the Director of the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies
and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
8
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customer".
The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its
obligations under each of its agreements:
Step 1: Identify the contract
with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance
obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction
price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue
when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The Company generates revenue
by selling API packages.
The Company recognizes revenue
when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product. There are
no additional performance obligations. The transaction price is fixed in the invoice. Payment is generally made prior to the services
being provided. If deposits are received prior to services being rendered, the Company recognizes deferred revenue until the services
are completed.
Recent Issued Accounting
Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed
all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these
pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company’s financial reporting.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Limited Operating History and Need for Additional
Capital
There is no historical financial
information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated sufficient
revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services
and products.
We have no assurance that
future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to
continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.

Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the shareholders and the board of directors of
Alixo-Yolloo Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Alixo-Yolloo Corporation as of February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended February 28, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statement, the Company incurred a net loss
of $(22,658) and an accumulated deficit of $(33,500) as of February 28, 2025, the Company currently have limited revenue.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern through February 28, 2025, is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing
financial support from its stockholders and lenders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external fund providers will provide
the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
the uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
11
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken
as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on
the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Going Concern Uncertainty
– See also Going Concern Uncertainty explanatory paragraph above:
As described in Note 2 to
the financial statements, the Company has operating losses. Furthermore, the company have limited revenue since the inception of business.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable business operation and obtaining additional
working capital funding from the Management. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern.
The procedures performed to address
the matter included.
(i)We inquired of executive officers, and key members of management, of the
Company regarding factors that would have an impact on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
(ii)We evaluated management’s plan for addressing the adverse effects of
the conditions identified, including assessing the reasonableness of forecasted information and underlying assumptions by comparing to
actual results of prior periods and actual results achieved to date, and utilizing our knowledge of the entity, its business and management
in considering liquidity needs and the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow,
(iii)We assessed the possibility of raising additional debt or credit,
(iv)We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of disclosures in the financial
statements.

ALIXO-YOLLOO CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FEBRUARY 28, 2025
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS
Alixo-Yolloo Corporation (“the Company”)
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on January 17, 2019 (Inception). Alixo-Yolloo Corporation developed a mobile
application 'Alixo'. A mobile application designed to help users identify music tracks based on short samples recorded via their device's
microphone. Alixo-Yolloo Corporation offers an API rental service for music recognition to other applications, utilizing neural network
databases for efficient identification of audio streams.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business
for the foreseeable future.
The Company has generated limited revenues since inception
and incurred a loss of $22,658 and $6,771 during the years ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024, respectively. The Company has
incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $33,500 as of February 28, 2025 and further losses are anticipated
in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next
twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.
The Company has adopted a February 28 (29) fiscal year end.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy prioritizes the
inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
17
These tiers include:
Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets;
Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices
in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3:  defined as unobservable inputs in which
little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The carrying value of cash and the Company's loan
from shareholder approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity.
Software
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 985, “Software”,
which requires that all costs incurred be expensed until technological feasibility have been established.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events and changes
in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 3 years.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customer".
The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its
obligations under each of its agreements:
Step 1: Identify the contract
with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance
obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction
price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue
when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The Company generates revenue
by selling API packages.
The Company recognizes revenue
when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product. There are
no additional performance obligations. The transaction price is fixed in the invoice. Payment is generally made prior to the services
being provided. If deposits are received prior to services being rendered, the Company recognizes deferred revenue until the services
are completed.
18
Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The
effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Basic Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in
accordance with ASC 260-10-45 “Earnings per Share”, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes al potential common
shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings
(loss) per share are equal.
Dividends
The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment
of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the period presented.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2023-07,
“Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” during the year ended February 28, 2025. This
ASU requires additional disclosures regarding reportable segments and significant segment expenses, but does not change how an entity
identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable
segments. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows,
or financial condition.
Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting
pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have
a material impact on the Company other than those relating to Development Stage Entities discussed above.
NOTE 4 – COMMON STOCK
The Company has 75,000,000 common shares authorized

NOTE 5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In support of the Company’s efforts and cash
requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate
financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities.
The advances were considered temporary in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note.
As of February 28, 2025, the Company’s director
had advanced the Company $73,034 to cover the Company's operating expenses, of which $51,684 were advanced and the Company made repayments

In July 2021, the Company sold 5,000,000 shares of
common stock at a price of $0.001 per share to its director.
NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE
ASSETS
The Company
follows the provisions of ASC 985, Software, which requires that all costs relating to the purchase or internal development and production
of software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, be expensed in the period incurred unless the requirements for technological
feasibility have been established. The Company amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic
life of the product.
During the year

NOTE 7 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contractual Commitments
The Company has entered into no contractual commitments
as of February 28, 2025.
Litigation
The Company was not subject to any legal proceedings
during the period from January 17, 2019 (Inception) to February 28, 2025 and no legal proceedings are currently pending or threatened
to the best of our knowledge.
NOTE 8 – INCOME TAX PROVISION
Deferred Tax Assets
As of February 28, 2025, the Company had net operating
loss (“NOL”) carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes of $33,500 that may be offset against future taxable income
through 2040.  No tax benefit has been recorded with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying financial
statements as the management of the Company believes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets of approximately
$7,035 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by
the full valuation allowance.
Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the
tax effect of NOL carry-forwards which was used to offset tax payable from prior year’s operations. The Company has provided
a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realization. The current valuation of tax
allowance is not applicable as of February 28, 2025.
Components of deferred tax assets are as follows:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that in light of the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of February 28, 2025. See material weaknesses discussed below in Management’s Annual Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2025, using the
criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission ("COSO - 2013").
A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2025, the Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
1. We lack an adequate
internal control structure – Due to the size of the Company we do not have the appropriate control activities, risk assessment procedures,
controls over information and communication, or effective monitoring controls.
2. We do not have
appropriate segregation of duties or adequate accounting resources – The Company has only one employee that does not have sufficient
accounting knowledge, experience, and understanding of US GAAP or SEC rules, therefore no expertise or reviews are in place to ensure
adequate financial reporting. Further, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view
that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial
statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered
to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
23
3. We do not have
appropriate information technology controls – The Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however,
there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft,
misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.  Further there are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or misstatement
in, financial reporting.
Accordingly, the Company
concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.
As a result of the material
weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of February 28, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting
There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended February 28, 2025, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information.
None.
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions
that Prevent Inspections.
Not applicable.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Our Board of Directors is
currently composed of two members, Rassul Sadakbayev, and Roman Zhezhel, who do not qualify as independent directors. In addition, our
board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our
board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Had
our Board of Directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the
directors and us with regard to each director’s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and
our management.
INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
No director, executive officer,
significant employee or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K
in the past 10 years.
26
AUDIT COMMITTEE, COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE, AND FINANCIAL EXPERT
We do not have an Audit Committee
or Compensation Committee. Additionally, we have no persons currently receiving any compensation due to our start-up nature. Our president
performs some of the same functions of an Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, such as: recommending a firm of independent certified
public accountants to audit the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditor’s independence, the financial statements,
and their audit report; reviewing management’s administration of the system of internal accounting controls, and determining all
compensation amounts. The Company does not currently have a written audit committee charter or a compensation committee charter or any
similar documents.
We have no financial expert.
We believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because of our start-up operations,
we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.
CODE OF ETHICS
The Company has not adopted
a formal written code of ethics due to the small size of the organization and start-up nature.
