Report”), unless otherwise stated or as the context otherwise requires, references to “Yijia Group Corp.,” “Yijia,”
“YJGJ,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references refer to Yijia
Group Corp., a Nevada corporation. Our logo and other trademarks or service marks of the Company appearing in this Annual Report are the

CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The information contained
in this Annual Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking
statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities in the
market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations
of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally identify forward-looking
statements as statements containing the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “continue,” “could,”
“estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “possible,”
“potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,”
“would” and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement
is not forward-looking.
Forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further
assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis of management’s views
and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs or
projections will result or be achieved or accomplished.
In addition to other factors
and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition, dependence on key personnel and
the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products, ability to expand markets and
the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.
For a discussion of the risks,
uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments or results, you should carefully review the “Risk
Factors” set forth under “Item 1. Business” below. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future
events, developments or results described by our forward-looking statements herein could turn to be materially different from those we
discuss or imply.
ii
PART I
Item 1. Business.
The Company was incorporated
on January 25, 2017 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On November 15, 2018, the Company changed its name to Yijia Group Corp. The
Company is in good standing in the State of Nevada and in any jurisdiction where it is qualified to do business.
Starting from July 30, 2021,
the Company commenced its operation in the rendering of business consulting service to domestic and international customers. The Company
provides consulting services to its clients with regards to funding and other financial matters.
On
November 9, 2023, the Company founded Nutripeak Trading Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Nevada. Nutripeak Trading
Corporation was established with the purpose of marketing and supplying healthcare products.
Corporate Organization Chart
Our products
Our core products are anti-aging
products that increase NAD+ levels. By boosting NAD+ levels, these products can promote anti-aging, enhance energy metabolism, improve
cognitive function, and strengthen cellular repair capabilities.
Our services
In addition to offering anti-aging
products, our company provides professional health consultation services. Our health advisors can offer personalized health advice and
recommend supplements tailored to each customer's needs. We design customized nutrition and wellness plans based on customers' physical
conditions, health goals, and lifestyle habits.
Our company also provides
consulting advisory services in management business, accounting and finance services.
1
Revenue Stream
The Company currently earns revenues from the following
segments.
The Consulting Service Segment mainly provides consulting
advisory services in management business, accounting and finance services; and the Healthcare Segment mainly provides healthcare products
and health consultation services to customers.
Sales and Marketing
Our company employs various
sales and marketing strategies to promote our anti-aging products. We utilize e-commerce platforms, our own website, brick-and-mortar
stores, social media, and direct sales. This multi-channel approach ensures that consumers with different shopping habits can access our
anti-aging products and truly experience their benefits.
Competition
In response to intense market
competition, our company focuses on continuous product innovation and development. We strengthen our brand through advertising, participation
in trade shows, and sponsoring public welfare projects. We also build alliances with hospitals, clinics, and health management institutions.
Flexible pricing strategies, including promotions, coupons, and discounts, are employed to attract customers. Expanding into international
markets reduces reliance on a single market and opens up new opportunities. These initiatives enable us to navigate the competitive landscape
effectively.
Number of Employees
Other than our officers,
the Company currently has [1] full-time employee. We currently have people ready to fill positions as soon as they are needed in both
office staff and work force roles.
Research and Development
We have not incurred any
research and development costs in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
Insurance
We do not maintain insurance
and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may
not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.
Government Regulation
We are required to comply
with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the our services and products in any
jurisdiction in which we conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulations have a material impact on the way we conduct
our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals to conduct our business.
2
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
As a “smaller reporting company,” as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
Risk Management and Strategy
We acknowledge the increasing importance of cybersecurity
in today’s digital and interconnected world. Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to the integrity of our systems and data,
potentially impacting our business operations, financial condition and reputation.
As a smaller reporting company, we currently do not
have formalized cybersecurity measures, a dedicated cybersecurity team or specific protocols in place to manage cybersecurity risks. Our
approach to cybersecurity is in the developmental stage, and we have not yet conducted comprehensive risk assessments, established an
incident response plan or engaged with external cybersecurity consultants for assessments or services.
Given our current stage of cybersecurity development,
we have not experienced any significant cybersecurity incidents to date. However, we recognize that the absence of a formalized cybersecurity
framework may leave us vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents. Such events could potentially lead
to unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, sensitive information, disrupt our business operations, result in regulatory fines or litigation
costs and negatively impact our reputation among customers and partners.
We are in the process of evaluating our cybersecurity
needs and developing appropriate measures to enhance our cybersecurity posture. This includes considering the engagement of external cybersecurity
experts to advise on best practices, conducting vulnerability assessments and developing an incident response strategy. Our goal is to
establish a cybersecurity framework that is commensurate with our size, complexity and the nature of our operations, thereby reducing
our exposure to cybersecurity risks.
In addition, the Board will oversee any cybersecurity
risk management framework and a dedicated committee of the Board or an officer appointed by the Board will review and approve any cybersecurity
policies, strategies and risk management practices.
Despite our efforts to improve our cybersecurity measures,
there can be no assurance that our initiatives will fully mitigate the risks posed by cyber threats. The landscape of cybersecurity risks
is constantly evolving, and we will continue to assess and update our cybersecurity measures in response to emerging threats.

Limited operating history; need for additional
capital
There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since
inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases
in services and products.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
We have no contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of April
30, 2025.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments
that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have
identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies
are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are
most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex
judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in
subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and
because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We
believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue recognition
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC
606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
12
The Company applies the following five steps in order
to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
·
identify the contract with a customer;
·
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
·
determine the transaction price;
·
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
·
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company also follows the guidance provided in
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent in arrangements with
customers that involve another party that contributes to the provision of services and sales of goods to customers. In these instances,
the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the goods or services itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified
goods to be provided by another party (as an agent). This determination is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances
of each arrangement.
The Company derives its revenue from consulting service
income and marketing and supplying of healthcare products.
Where the Company acts as a principal, it sells its
products directly to restaurants, retailers and individual consumers through its distributor channels. The Company considers Sales Agreement
to be a contract with the customer. Customer confirmations are executed at the time an order is placed. Revenue is recognized when control
of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), when the services
are rendered, or the products are dispatched or picked up by customer. As a result, the Company has a present and unconditional right
to payment and record the amount due from the customer in accounts receivable. For each contract, the Company considers the promise to
transfer products to be the only identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether
the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.
For the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s
sales of healthcare products are recognized at a point in time for its roles as principal, whereas consulting service fee income is recognized
when services are transferred over time.

of operation, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year in the period ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
at April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows the year in the period ended April 30, 2025 and 2024,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The financial statements
are presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have
been eliminated upon consolidation.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts on the prior year’s consolidated
balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and cash flows were reclassified to conform to current-year presentation, with no
effect on ending stockholders’ equity.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant areas for which management uses estimates
include:
·
sales returns at point in time and allowances;
·
inventory;
·
income tax valuation allowances
These estimates require the use of judgment as future
events, and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience
is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult
outside experts to assist as considered necessary.
F-8
Segment Reporting
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent
with the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major
customers in consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company has two business segments consisted of consulting service segment
and healthcare segment operating in the United States of America.
Cash
Cash is carried at cost and represents cash on hand
and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions.
Inventories
Inventories
primarily consist of finished healthcare products which are stated at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method and includes all costs to acquire and other
costs to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. The Company takes ownership, risks, and rewards of the products
purchased.
Inventories
are written down to estimated net realizable value, which could be impacted by certain factors including historical usage, expected demand,
anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, product obsolescence, and other factors. The Company continuously evaluates
the recoverability of the Company’s inventories, and inventory provisions are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income. The Company did not record write-down of potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventories or lower of cost or
market adjustment for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
Revenue Recognition
·
identify the contract with a customer;
·
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
·
determine the transaction price;
·
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
·
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Currently, the Company operates in two business segments.
The Consulting Service Segment mainly provides consulting
advisory services in management, business, accounting and finance; and the Healthcare Segment mainly provides healthcare products and
health consultation services to customers.
The sale and distribution of healthcare products,
such as Nicotinamide Riboside capsules, has only one performance obligation under the fixed-fee arrangements. Revenue is recognized from
the sale of their healthcare products upon delivery or pick up by the customers, whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred
to customers.
For those sales orders which are delivered by the
Company, shipping term is under Ex Works (“EXW”), the Company fulfills the obligation to deliver when the products are available
on their premises, i.e. the warehouse. Those customers are responsible for all transportation costs, risk of loss, and any other costs
that point onward.
F-9
Revenue is earned from the rendering of consulting
advisory services to customers. The Company recognizes services revenue over the period in which such services are performed and billed
to the customer, pursuant to the fulfillment of service terms in the agreement.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The following
table provides information about disaggregated revenue from customers into the nature of the products and services provided, and the related
timing of revenue recognition:

TOTAL

$570,694
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues, which are directly attributable
to the sale of healthcare products, primarily consists of purchase costs of merchandizes.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance
with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies
should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on
a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the
position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as
the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority
assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
The Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions
or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results of operations for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024. The
Company and its subsidiary are subject to local and various foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns remain open subject
to examination by major tax jurisdictions.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company did not take any uncertain tax
positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25
for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
F-10
Net Income Per Share
The Company computes net income per share in accordance
with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income per share gives effect to all diluted potential
common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive income per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As of April 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding.
Stock Based Compensation
Pursuant to ASU 2018-07, the Company follows ASC 718, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (“ASC 718”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards (employee or non-employee), are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated
to issue. Restricted stock units are valued using the market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant.
Related Parties
Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
are considered to be related if the entities have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
influence over the party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject
to common control or common significant influence.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic
820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value as follows:
·
Level 1: Inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets;
·
Level 2: Inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. Black-Scholes Option-Pricing model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs; and
·
Level 3: Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
The carrying value of cash, amount due to a related
party and other current assets approximates its fair value due to their short-term nature of these financial instruments.
Recent Accounting Standard Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment
Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment
disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide
all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to
all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim
periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact this amended guidance may have on the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements.
F-11
Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the
effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective
tax rate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance
requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating
individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes
paid (net of refunds received). The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance can
be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact this amended guidance
may have on the footnotes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Except for the above-mentioned pronouncements, there
are no new recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets,
statements of operations and cash flows.
NOTE 3 —

The valuation allowance as of April 30, 2025 and 2024
was $102,611 and $46,969, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists
relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of April
30, 2025 and 2024. Up to six years since inception remain open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and State of Nevada.
The valuation allowance was attributed to Yijia Group Corp. which incurred a loss position.

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK
The Company is exposed
to the following concentrations of risk:
(a)
Cash
The Company maintains cash with banks in the United
States of America (“USA”). Should any bank holding cash become insolvent, or if the Company is otherwise unable to withdraw
funds, the Company would lose the cash with that bank; however, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes
it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts. In the United States, the standard insurance amount is $250,000
per depositor in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to significant concentrations of credit risk are cash. As of April 30, 2025 and 2024, $301,267 and $301,267 of the Company’s
cash held by financial institutions were uninsured, respectively.
(b)
Major customers
For the years
ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the customers who accounts for 10% or more of the Company’s revenues and its outstanding receivable
balances as at year-end dates, are presented as follows:

Credit risk
Financial instruments that are potentially subject
to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables
is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection terms. The Company does not generally
require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for expected credit losses based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company’s management,
with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive and principal
financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.
Management’s Report
on Internal Controls over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025 using the criteria
established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Tread way Commission ("COSO").
A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, the Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
1.
We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
2.
We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of April 30, 2025, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.
3.
We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As of April 30, 2025, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.
14
Accordingly, the Company
concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.
As a result of the material
weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of April 30, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
System of Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An evaluation was conducted
under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of April 30, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information.
During the quarter ended April 30, 2025, no director
or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in
Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

Herb Group Holdings between 2014 and 2019.
Ruiming Zhou has been a Director since
September 2023. Mr. Zhou graduated from the First Vocational School of Ba Meng, Inner Mongolia.
Since June 2017, he has been serving as a director at Shandong Tengjunxiang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
Steve Niu has been our Chief Financial
Officer since January 2024. Dr. Steve Niu has served as the President of Triangle Accounting, Inc.
since 2001. He specializes in U.S. federal and state taxation, international taxation, and foreign income consulting. He has also been

University, Canada, in 2001 and 1998, respectively. In 1984, he graduated from Xi’an University of Science and Technology with a
Bachelor’s degree in Mining Engineering.
Compliance with Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Our common stock is not registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Accordingly, our executive
officers and directors and persons who own more than 5% of a registered class of our equity securities are not subject to the beneficial
ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Code of Ethics
Our Board has not adopted a written code of business
conduct and ethics.
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
Our Board has responsibility for the oversight of
our risk management processes and, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures,
their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports
from board committees and members of senior management to enable our Board to understand our risk identification, risk management and
risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, cybersecurity,
strategic and reputational risk.
16
Committees of the Board of Directors
We have not
yet established Compensation, Audit, and Nominations and Corporate Governance committees nor do we have an Audit Committee financial expert
as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act. Currently, the functions of these committees are
performed by our entire Board of Directors. We hope to establish these committees and appoint an Audit Committee financial expert as our
business develops.
Family Relationships
We currently do not have any of our officers or directors
who are related to each other.
Corporate Governance
There have been no changes
in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having
no nominating committee for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based
on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
Except as disclosed below, to our knowledge, none
of our current directors or executive officers has, during the past ten (10) years:
·
been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
·
had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two (2) years prior to that time;
·
been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his or her involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;
·
been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;
·
been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or
·
been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.
17
Indemnification and Limitation on Liability of
Directors
The Company’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada, any officer or director of the Company, who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to serve at the request of the Company as
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or while serving as a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving or
has agreed to serve at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent (which, for purposes hereof, shall include
a trustee, partner or manager or similar capacity) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
indemnification obligation includes, without limitation, claims for monetary damages against Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted
under Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes as in existence on the date hereof.
The indemnification provided shall be from and against
expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee
or on the indemnitee’s behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, but shall only be provided
if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action, suit or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the indemnitee’s
conduct was unlawful.
At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding
involving any of our directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification will be required or permitted. Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
Insider Trading Policy
We do not maintain insider trading policies and procedures governing
the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of our securities by our directors, officers, and employees that we believe are reasonably
designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us. We have failed to do so due to limited
number of members of management, limited resources, and the lack of equity awards granted to management. We intend to adopt an insider
trading policy in the near future.

to the grant of certain equity awards close in time to the release of material non-public information. Although we do not have a formal
policy, program, or plan that requires us to award equity or equity-based compensation on specific dates, we do not grant equity awards
in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock,
and do not time the public release of such information based on award grant dates. During the last completed fiscal year, we have not
made awards to any named executive officer or director during the period beginning four business days before and ending one business day
after the filing of a period report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form 8-K, and we have

any pledge by any person of securities of the Company, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
The Company has been provided
free office space by its stockholder. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its
financial statements.
From time to time, the stockholder
and director of the Company advanced funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing
and due on demand.

and balances detailed elsewhere in these accompanying financial statements, the Company has no other significant or material related party
transactions during the years presented.

Director Independence
We have adopted standards
for director independence that correspond to NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. An “independent director” means a person
who is not an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion
of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. To be considered
independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that neither the director, nor any member of his or her immediate family, has had
any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company within the previous three years. In addition, to be considered “independent”
under SEC rules, each member of the Audit Committee may not accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory
fee from us, other than compensation for his or her services as a director.
The Board considered relationships,
transactions and/or arrangements with each of the directors and concluded that none of the non-employee directors, or any of his or her
immediate family members, has any relationship with us that would impair his or her independence. The Board has determined that each member
of the Board, is not an independent director under applicable NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules.
Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.
During the year
ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we engaged Simon & Edward, LLP (“S&E”) as the Company’s independent registered
