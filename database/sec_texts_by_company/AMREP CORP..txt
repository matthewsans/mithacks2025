All references to the Company in this annual report on Form 10-K include AMREP Corporation and its subsidiaries. Many of the amounts and percentages presented in this annual report on Form 10-K have been rounded for convenience of presentation. All references in this annual report on Form 10-K to 2025 and 2024 mean the Company’s fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, unless the context otherwise indicates.PART IItem 1.          BusinessAMREP Corporation was organized in 1961 as an Oklahoma corporation and, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. The Company conducts a substantial portion of its business in Rio Rancho, New Mexico (“Rio Rancho”) and certain adjoining areas of Sandoval County, New Mexico. Rio Rancho is the third largest city in New Mexico with a population of approximately 112,500.Land DevelopmentAs of April 30, 2025, the Company owned approximately 16,600 acres in Sandoval County, New Mexico. The Company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped real property to national, regional and local homebuilders, commercial and industrial property developers and others. Activities conducted or arranged by the Company include land and site planning, obtaining governmental and environmental approvals (“entitlements”), installing utilities and storm drains, ensuring the availability of water service, building or improving roads necessary for land development and constructing community amenities. The Company develops both residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use as demand warrants. Engineering work is performed by both the Company’s employees and outside firms, but development work is generally performed by outside contractors. The Company also provides landscaping services primarily to homebuilders.The Company markets land for sale or lease both directly and through brokers. With respect to residential development, the Company generally focuses its sales efforts on a limited number of homebuilders, with 100% of 2025 developed residential land sales having been made to three homebuilders. The number of new construction single-family residential starts in Rio Rancho by the Company, the Company’s customers and other builders was 973 in 2025 and 1,007 in 2024. The development of residential, commercial and industrial properties requires, among other things, financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.The Company opportunistically acquires land, focusing primarily in New Mexico. Prior to acquiring large properties, the Company generally performs market research, soil tests, environmental studies and other engineering work, reviews zoning and other governmental requirements, has discussions with homebuilders or other prospective end-users of the property and performs financial analysis of the project and estimated development costs. The continuity and future growth of the Company’s real estate business, if the Company pursues such growth, will require that the Company acquire new properties in New Mexico or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate business. The Company competes with other owners and developers of land that offer for sale developed and undeveloped residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use.​1

High contiguous ownership areas may be suitable for development, including as special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for development under the auspices of local government. Low contiguous ownership areas may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or may be offered for sale individually or in small groups.Infrastructure Reimbursement Mechanisms. A portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills subdivision are subject to a public improvement district. The public improvement district reimburses the Company for certain costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district. The Company has accepted and may in the future accept discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district.The Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants on various land development projects. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected to reimburse the Company for certain costs of developing the subject property by imposing an assessment on the real property owners subject to the covenants. The Company has accepted and may in the future accept discounted prepayments of amounts due under the private infrastructure reimbursement covenants. Impact fees are charges or assessments payable by homebuilders to local governing authorities in order to generate revenue for funding or recouping the costs of capital improvements or facility expansions necessitated by and attributable to new developments. The Company receives credits, allowances and offsets applicable to impact fees in connection with certain costs incurred by the Company in developing subdivisions, which the Company generally sells to homebuilders.1 Developed lots/acreage are any tracts of land owned by the Company that have been entitled with infrastructure work that is substantially complete, but excludes any lots that have been leased to third parties.2 Acreage under development is real estate owned by the Company for which entitlement or infrastructure work has been started but not completed. However, there is no assurance that the acreage under development will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. In addition, the mix of residential and commercial acreage under development may change prior to final development. The development of this acreage will require significant additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.3 There is no assurance that undeveloped acreage will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. Undeveloped acreage is real estate that can be sold “as is” (e.g., where no entitlement or infrastructure work has begun on such property).​2
Mineral Rights. The Company owns certain minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately 55,000 surface acres of land in Sandoval County, New Mexico.HomebuildingThe Company operates a homebuilder in New Mexico. The Company offers a variety of home floor plans and elevations at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to meet the needs of homebuyers. The Company focuses on building and selling single-family detached and attached homes. The Company selects locations for homebuilding based on available land inventory and the feasibility of the project. The Company utilizes internal and external sales brokers for home sales. Model homes are generally used to showcase the Company’s homes and their design features. The Company provides built-to-order homes where construction of the homes does not begin until the customer signs the purchase agreement and speculative (“spec”) homes for homebuyers who require a home within a short time frame. Sales contracts with homebuyers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes. Sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides homebuyers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain appropriate mortgage financing within a specified period. Contracts may also include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. The construction of homes is conducted under the supervision of the Company’s on-site construction field managers. Most construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreed-upon price. Although significant changes in market conditions could impact our seasonal patterns, the Company has historically experienced variability in its quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. The Company generally experiences increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during its fiscal first quarter and fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings. This seasonal activity increases the Company’s working capital requirements in the Company’s third and fourth quarters to support home production volume. As a result of the seasonality of the Company’s operations, the Company’s quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year; however any seasonal effect on revenues is expected to be relatively insignificant compared to the effect of the timing of opening of a property for sale and the subsequent timing of closings.The housing industry in New Mexico is highly competitive. Numerous national, regional and local homebuilders compete for homebuyers on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design and community amenities. This competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes the Company delivers or cause the Company to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume. The Company also competes with resales of existing homes and available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental markets could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes.Materials and LaborGenerally, construction materials for the Company’s operations are available from numerous sources. However, the cost and availability of certain building materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices and capacity as well as government regulation, such as government-imposed tariffs or trade restrictions. The ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand, which is compounded by the limited supply of certain specialized trades and contractors in the market. To partially protect against changes in construction costs, labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with homebuilders or homebuyers. However, the Company cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future.Regulatory and Environmental MattersThe Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state and local governing authorities. These regulations are complex and include building codes, land zoning and other entitlement restrictions, health and safety regulations, labor practices, marketing and sales practices, environmental regulations and various other laws, rules and regulations. The applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations. The Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay anticipated development and construction activities.Government restrictions, standards and regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts or related to the availability of water may result in restrictions on land development or homebuilding in certain areas and may increase energy, transportation or raw material costs, which could reduce the Company’s profit margins and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. Weather conditions and natural disasters can harm the Company. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, delay or increase costs of land development or damage homes or land development under construction. These matters may result in delays, may cause the Company to incur substantial 3
compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict land development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas.Human Capital ResourcesAs of April 30, 2025, the Company employed 49 employees, of which 48 were full-time employees and one was a part-time employee. The Company believes the people who work for the Company are its most important resource and are critical to the Company’s continued success. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support the Company’s operations.

PART IIItem 5.          Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AXR”. On July 21, 2025, there were 246 holders of record of the common stock.The Company’s common stock is often thinly traded. As a result, large transactions in the Company’s common stock may be difficult to execute in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the Company’s common stock. Among other reasons, the stock is thinly traded due to the fact that three of the Company’s shareholders beneficially owned approximately 51% of the outstanding common stock as of July 21, 2025 according to available information. The average trading volume in the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the thirty-day trading period ending on April 30, 2025 was 16,350 shares per day.The Company is an Oklahoma corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of its certificate of incorporation and of Oklahoma law generally prohibit the Company from engaging in “business combinations” with an “interested shareholder,” as those terms are defined therein, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the Company’s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction. Consequently, the concurrence of the Company’s largest shareholders would generally be needed for any “interested shareholder” to acquire control of the Company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the Company’s other shareholders.Dividend PolicyThe Company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock since fiscal year 2008. The Company may consider dividends from time-to-time in the future in light of conditions then existing, including earnings, financial condition, cash position, capital requirements and other needs. No assurance is given that there will be any such future dividends declared.Equity Compensation Plan InformationSee Item 12, which incorporates such information by reference from the Company’s Proxy Statement for its 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.​Item 6.           [Reserved]Item 7.           Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFor a description of the Company’s business, refer to Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K. As indicated in Item 1, the Company is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements.The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include: (1) land sale cost of revenues, net calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (2) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets and assets held for sale; (3) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (4) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.6
There are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas. Management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience, third-party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following:●land sale cost of revenues, net are incurred throughout the life of a project, and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies, but not yet incurred;●when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, a test for asset impairment may be required. Asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets, the grouping of those assets, the expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. For real estate projects under development, an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is determined using estimated future expenditures necessary to complete such projects and using management’s best estimates about sales prices and holding periods. Testing of long-lived assets includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins, administrative expenses and terminal values. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a particular asset group is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material;●the Company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities; and●the Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projects its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of net deferred tax assets.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYear Ended April 30, 2025 Compared to Year Ended April 30, 2024For 2025, the Company had net income of $12,716,000, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6,690,000, or $1.25 per diluted share, in 2024.During 2025 and 2024, the Company experienced material delays in municipal entitlements, infrastructure availability, approvals and inspections and utility response times in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. While construction and land costs remain elevated, the Company has been able to partially offset these cost increases through land and home price increases in 2025 and 2024 due to a strong pricing environment, which may not continue. The rising cost of housing due to increases in average sales prices in recent years and the level of mortgage interest rates, coupled with general inflation in the U.S. economy and other macroeconomic factors, have placed pressure on overall housing affordability, negatively affecting demand and have caused many potential homebuyers to pause and reconsider their housing choices. In addition, any tariffs on goods used as inputs in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment may result in further increases in the cost of housing and average sales prices. Given the affordability challenges and the resulting impact on demand, the Company has provided sales incentives on certain homes, reduced the size of lots and homes, opportunistically leased completed homes and slowed the pace of housing starts and land development projects. During 2025 and 2024, the Company reduced the number and scope of its active land development projects and delayed proceeding with certain new land development projects due to market headwinds and uncertainty and an increase in entitlement and infrastructure delays as compared to prior years. This is expected to result in a reduction of revenues from the sale of developed residential land during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2026 as compared to 2024 and 2025. Future economic conditions and the demand for land and homes are subject to continued uncertainty due to many factors, including changes in mortgage interest rates, inflation, tariffs, supplies of new and existing home inventory available for sale, labor shortages and other factors. The Company’s past performance may not be indicative of future results.7

Revenues from the sale of undeveloped land included the sale in 2025 of 549 acres of contiguous undeveloped land in Sandoval County, New Mexico, representing $2,502,000 of revenue, to one purchaser and the sale in 2024 of 147 acres in Brighton, Colorado, representing $7,200,000 of revenue, to one purchaser. The Company does not expect the sale of the properties in the prior sentence to be indicative of future undeveloped land sale revenues.●The change in home sale revenues for 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold offset in part by a decrease in average selling prices.

The change in gross margin was primarily due to changes in public improvement district reimbursements, private infrastructure covenant reimbursements and payments for impact fee credits and the location, size and mix of property sold (including the sale of 690.4 acres for 2025 as compared to 222.9 acres for 2024 of undeveloped land with a low associated land sale cost of revenues).●The change in home sale cost of revenues for 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily due to the number, location, size and mix of homes sold and increases in the prices of building materials and skilled labor. Home sale gross margins were 21% for 2025 compared to 25% for 2024. The change in gross margin was primarily due to the location, size and mix of homes sold, increases in the amount of sales incentives to homebuyers and increases in the prices of building materials and skilled labor.●Other cost of revenues for 2025 consist of the cost of goods sold for landscaping services. Other cost of revenues for 2024 consist of the costs associated with the sale of investment assets and cost of goods sold for landscaping services. The costs associated with the sale of investment assets in 2024 primarily represented the costs to construct two buildings leased to commercial tenants.As a result of many factors, including the nature and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land or homes being sold, revenues, average selling prices and related gross margins from land sales or home sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods.9
General and Administrative Expenses. The following presents information on general and administrative expenses (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,  ​    2025    2024    Increase (decrease) Land development ​$ 3,847​$ 3,677 $ 170​ 5%Homebuilding ​  1,764​  1,214 ​ 550​ 45%Corporate ​  1,667​  1,980 ​ (313)​ (16)%Total​$ 7,278​$ 6,871​​ 407​ 6%​●The change in land development general and administrative expenses for 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs for landscaping services and a decrease in property taxes as a result of refunds of previously paid amounts.●The change in homebuilding general and administrative expenses for 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily due to expansion of the Company’s homebuilding operations and information technology expenses.●The change in corporate general and administrative expenses for 2025 compared to 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in professional services and pension benefit expenses as a result of the termination of the Company’s pension plan and an increase in bank charges.The Company did not record any non-cash impairment charges on real estate inventory or investment assets in 2025 or 2024. Due to volatility in market conditions and development costs, the Company may experience future impairment charges.Interest Income, net. Interest income, net was $1,622,000 for 2025 and $823,000 for 2024. There were no interest or loan costs capitalized in real estate inventory in 2025. Interest and loan costs of $2,000 were capitalized in real estate inventory in 2024.Income Taxes. The Company had a provision for income taxes of $1,009,000 for 2025 and $1,735,000 for 2024. The provision for income taxes for 2025 related to the amount of income before income taxes during the year and to the reclassification of the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to a benefit for income taxes. In connection with the termination of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan, $1,230,000 of income tax effects that remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were reclassified to a benefit for income taxes during 2025. Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The provision for income taxes for 2024 correlated to the amount of income before income taxes during the year.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as follows (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,​​​2025​2024​Increase (decrease)​Cash​$ 10,651​$ 10,465​$ 186​ 2%U.S. Government Securities​​ 28,815​  19,229​  9,586​ 50%Restricted Cash​​ 455​  547​  (92)​ (17)%Total​$ 39,921​$ 30,241​​ 9,680​ 32%​Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding restricted cash.AMREP Corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a holding company, AMREP Corporation is dependent on its available cash and cash equivalents and on cash and cash equivalents from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations. The Company’s liquidity is affected by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the real estate industry and the economy generally. 10
The Company’s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flows from operations, a revolving line of credit, bank financing for specific real estate projects, interest income and existing balances of cash and cash equivalents. Land and homebuilding properties generally cannot be sold quickly, and the ability of the Company to sell properties has been and will continue to be affected by market conditions. The ability of the Company to generate cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the timeframes the Company has established for each property. The development of additional lots for sale, construction of homes or commercial buildings for sale or lease or pursuing other real estate projects may require financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms (or at all). If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected.The Company expects the primary demand for funds in the future will be for the development and acquisition of land, construction of home and commercial projects and general and administrative expenses. In many instances, the development of land and construction of home and commercial projects are required to satisfy delivery obligations to customers. Further, the Company regularly evaluates property available for purchase from third parties for possible acquisition by the Company. To the extent the sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet its needs, the Company may conduct public or private offerings of securities, dispose of certain assets or draw on existing or new debt facilities. The Company believes that it has adequate cash and cash equivalents, bank financing and cash flows from operations to provide for its anticipated spending in its fiscal year ending April 30, 2026.Any epidemic, pandemic or similar serious public health issue, and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it (including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations), could significantly disrupt or prevent the Company from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period, including disruptions to the Company’s supply chain and shortages in labor and certain building components and materials. As a result, the impact of such public health issues and the related governmental actions could materially impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Pension Plan. The Company’s defined benefit pension plan was terminated in 2024. The Company did not make any contributions to the pension plan during 2024. During 2024, the Company transferred $547,000, which was the amount of residual assets (after satisfying any pension plan liabilities) following termination of the defined benefit pension plan, from the defined benefit pension plan to the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan available for future awards to eligible employees. This amount that was transferred to the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan is recognized as restricted cash on the Company’s balance sheet. During 2025, the Company utilized $92,000 of this restricted cash to fund its 401(k) employer contribution for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the Company’s 401(k) plan.Cash Flow.

From April 30, 2024 to April 30, 2025, the change in land inventory was primarily due to the sale of land offset in part by land development activity, the change in homebuilding model and completed inventory was primarily due to the completion of homes not yet sold offset in part by the sale of homes and the change in homebuilding construction in process was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes that started construction.●Investment assets, net consist of (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​April 30, ​Increase ​    2025    2024     (decrease) Land held for long-term investment​$ 8,843​$ 9,200 $ (357)​ (4)%Owned real estate leased or intended to be leased​  6,207​  3,449 ​ 2,758​ 80%Less accumulated depreciation​  (170)​  (98) ​ (72)​ 73%Owned real estate leased or intended to be leased, net​  6,037​  3,351 ​ 2,686​ 80%Total​$ 14,880​$ 12,551​​​​​​​Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding investment assets.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K).Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. IMPACT OF INFLATIONThe Company’s operations can be impacted by inflation. Inflation can cause increases in interest rates and the cost of land, materials, services and labor. Unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies, operating margins will decrease. The Company’s homebuilding segment as well as homebuilders that are customers of the Company’s land development business segment face inflationary concerns that rising housing costs, including interest costs, may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home. If this situation were to exist, the demand for homes produced by the Company’s homebuilding segment could decrease and the demand for the Company’s land by homebuilder customers could decrease. As a result of inflationary pressures, the Company has experienced increases in the prices of labor and certain materials in 2025 and 2024. Inflation may also increase the Company’s financing costs. While the Company attempts to pass on to its customers increases in costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit the Company’s ability to do so. If the Company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, the Company’s revenues, gross margins and net income could be adversely affected.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibilities of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls, material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, even internal controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.​Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025 based upon the criteria set forth in a report entitled “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of April 30, 2025, internal control over financial reporting was effective. ​This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to such attestation pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K.​​14

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively apply the change in accounting described in Note 15, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the adjustments to retrospectively apply the change in accounting described in Note 15 and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those adjustments were audited by other auditors.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Common Land Sale Cost of RevenuesCritical Audit Matter DescriptionAs described in Notes 1, 2, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records common land sale cost of revenues based upon an allocation of certain common development costs associated with the entire project. Common development costs include the installation of utilities and roads and can be based upon estimates to complete. The allocation of these costs is based upon the estimates. These estimates and cost allocations are reviewed on a regular basis until a project is substantially completed and may be revised and reallocated as necessary on the basis of current estimates.16
We identified common land sale cost of revenues as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes in allocating common land costs to individual parcels of real estate once sold. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the critical audit matter included, among other things, the following:●Testing significant assumptions used to develop the estimated costs to complete the land development projects.●Testing completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and allocation calculations.●Testing rollforward of land held for development including detailed testing of cost of sales and additions. This includes testing the actual development costs to supporting documentation including underlying contracts.●Testing the reasonableness of the assumptions utilized in the allocation of common development costs.​/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLPBaker Tilly US, LLPWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2022 to 2024.Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaJuly 23, 2024​​17

AMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(1)          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIESOrganization and principles of consolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMREP Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). The Company is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated balance sheets are presented in an unclassified format since the Company has substantial operations in the real estate industry and its operating cycle is greater than one year. Fiscal yearThe Company’s fiscal year ends on April 30. All references to 2025 and 2024 mean the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, unless the context otherwise indicates.Revenue recognitionThe Company accounts for land sale revenues, home sale revenues and other revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).Land sale revenues: Revenues and cost of revenues from land sales are recognized when the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, consideration has been exchanged, control, legal title and other attributes of ownership have been conveyed to the buyer by means of a closing and the Company is not obligated to perform further significant development of the specific property sold. In general, the Company’s performance obligation for each of these land sales is fulfilled upon the delivery of the land, which generally coincides with the receipt of cash consideration from the counterparty.Land sale cost of revenues, net includes all direct acquisition costs and other costs specifically identified with the property, including pre-acquisition costs and capitalized real estate taxes and interest, and an allocation of certain common development costs associated with the entire project. Common development costs include the installation of utilities and roads, and may be based upon estimates of cost to complete. The allocation of costs is based on the estimated relative sales values of the individual parcels of land being sold to the total expected sales value for the unsold parcels of land in the applicable portion of the subdivision. Estimates and cost allocations are reviewed on a regular basis until a project is substantially completed, and are revised and reallocated as necessary on the basis of current estimates. Amounts received from public improvement districts, private infrastructure covenants and payments for impact fee credits reduce the amount of land sale cost of revenues.Home sale revenues: Revenues and cost of revenues from home sales are recognized at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer. The Company’s performance obligation to deliver a home is generally satisfied in less than one year from the date a binding sale agreement is signed. In general, the Company’s performance obligation for each home sale is fulfilled upon the delivery of the completed home, which generally coincides with the receipt of cash consideration from the counterparty. If the Company’s performance obligations are not complete upon the home closing, the Company defers a portion of the home sale revenues related to the outstanding obligations and subsequently recognizes that revenue upon completion of such obligations. As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, deferred home sale revenues and costs related thereto were immaterial. Forfeited customer deposits for homes are recognized in home sale revenues in the period in which the Company determines that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and the Company has the right to retain the deposit. In order to promote sales of homes, the Company may offer sales incentives to homebuyers. These incentives vary by type and amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. Incentives are reflected as a reduction in home sale revenues. Home construction and related costs are capitalized as incurred within real estate inventory under the specific identification method on the balance sheet and are charged to home sale cost of revenues on the consolidated statement of operations when the related home is sold.The Company offers homeowners a comprehensive third- party assurance warranty on each home. Estimates of the Company’s exposure to warranty claims are included within accrued expenses at the time home sale revenues are recognized.23
Other revenues: Other revenues and other cost of revenues consist of sale of certain investment assets, landscaping revenues and miscellaneous other revenues. Revenues from sale of investment assets (that are not otherwise classified as land sale revenues) are recognized when the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, consideration has been exchanged, title and other attributes of ownership have been conveyed to the buyer by means of a closing and the Company is not obligated to perform further significant development of the specific property sold. In general, the Company’s performance obligation for a sale of investment assets is fulfilled upon the delivery of the property, which generally coincides with the receipt of cash consideration from the counterparty. Other cost of revenues includes all direct acquisition costs and other costs specifically identified with the property, including pre-acquisition and acquisition costs, if applicable, closing and selling costs and construction costs.Landscaping revenues consist of landscaping services provided by the Company primarily to homebuilders.Miscellaneous other revenues primarily include extension fees for purchase contracts, forfeited deposits from land sale contracts and rental payments and additional rent from tenants pursuant to leases with respect to property or buildings of the Company. Base rental payments are recognized as revenue monthly over the term of the lease in accordance with ASC Topic 842 (Leases). Additional rent related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance and other operating expenses is recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred.Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cashCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value because of changes in interest rates. A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and has an original maturity of ninety days or less when purchased. Restricted cash consists of cash deposits with the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan representing the amount of residual assets (after satisfying any pension plan liabilities) following termination of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Interest payments on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are recorded as income on the statement of operations.Short-Term InvestmentsShort-term investments are held-to-maturity debt investments that have original maturities of greater than ninety days when purchased and remaining maturities of less than one year. Held-to-maturity debt investments are debt investments, such as certificates of deposit and U.S. government securities, that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity debt investments are recorded at their original purchase amount (and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable) with interest payments recorded as income on the statement of operations.Long-lived assetsLong-lived assets consist of real estate inventory and investment assets and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 360-10 (Property, Plant, and Equipment – Overall). A substantial majority of the Company’s real estate assets are located in Rio Rancho, New Mexico (“Rio Rancho”) and certain adjoining areas of Sandoval County, New Mexico. As a result of this geographic concentration, the Company has been and will be affected by changes in economic conditions in that region.Real estate inventory: Real estate inventory includes land and improvements on land held for development or sale. The cost basis of the land and improvements includes all direct acquisition costs including development costs, certain amenities, capitalized interest, capitalized real estate taxes and other costs. Interest and real estate taxes are not capitalized unless active development is underway. Real estate inventory is stated at accumulated cost.Investment assets, net: Investment assets, net consist of (i) land held for long-term investment, which represents property located in areas that are not planned to be developed in the near term and that has not been offered for sale in the normal course of business, and (ii) owned real estate leased or intended to be leased, which represents homes and buildings leased or intended to be leased to third parties. Investment assets are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Depreciation of investment assets (other than land) is provided principally by the straight-line method at various rates calculated to amortize the book values of the assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally are 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements. Land is not subject to depreciation.Impairment of long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are evaluated and tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Asset impairment tests are based upon the intended use of assets, expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins and general and administrative expenses. 24
The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a project is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material. Due to the subjective nature of the estimates and assumptions used in determining future cash flows, actual results could differ materially from current estimates and the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.LeasesRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term over one year. Leases with an initial term of one year or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Right-of-use assets are classified within other assets and the corresponding lease liability is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the balance sheet.Share-based compensationAwards of restricted stock, stock options and deferred stock units are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718-10 (Compensation - Stock Compensation - Overall), which requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and amortized over the service period (generally equal to the vesting period). Compensation expense for awards of restricted stock, stock options and deferred stock units are based on the fair value of the awards at their grant dates. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock is the price of the stock on the date of grant. The grant-date fair value of deferred stock units is the price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. To estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model estimates the per share fair value of an option on its date of grant based on the following: the option’s exercise price; the price of the underlying stock on the date of grant; the estimated dividend yield; a “risk-free” interest rate; the estimated option term; and the expected volatility. For the “risk-free” interest rate, the Company uses a U.S. Treasury bond due in a number of years equal to the option’s expected term. To estimate expected volatility, the Company analyzes the historic volatility of the Company’s common stock.Income taxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Unvested restricted shares of common stock are not included in the computation of basic earnings per share, as they are considered contingently returnable shares. Unvested restricted shares of common stock are included in diluted earnings per share if they are dilutive. Deferred stock units are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share computations. Stock options are not included in the computation of basic earnings per share. Stock options are included in diluted earnings per share if they are not anti-dilutive and are in-the-money.Comprehensive incomeComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events from non-owner sources. Total comprehensive income is the total of net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss.Management’s estimates and assumptionsThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant judgments and estimates that affect the financial statements include, but are not limited to, (i) land sale cost of revenues, net calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (ii) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets and assets held for sale; (iii) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (iv) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. The Company bases its significant estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.25

The public improvement district reimburses the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district. The Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants on various land development projects. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subject property by imposing a special levy on the real property owners subject to the covenants. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the private infrastructure reimbursement covenants. Impact fees are charges or assessments payable by homebuilders to local governing authorities in order to generate revenue for funding or recouping the costs of capital improvements or facility expansions necessitated by and attributable to the new development. The Company receives credits, allowances and offsets applicable to impact fees in connection with certain costs incurred by the Company in developing subdivisions, which the Company generally sells to homebuilders.Home sale cost of revenues includes costs for residential homes that were sold.Other cost of revenues for 2025 primarily consists of cost of goods sold for landscaping services. Other cost of revenues for 2024 primarily consists of the costs associated with the sale of investment assets and cost of goods sold for landscaping services.​(9)          GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESGeneral and administrative expenses consist of (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30, ​    2025    2024Land development​$ 3,847​$ 3,677Homebuilding​  1,764​  1,214Corporate​  1,667​  1,980Total​$ 7,278​$ 6,871​​(10)          FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The FASB’s guidance classifies the inputs to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level 3  Inputs for the asset or liability are unobservable and reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.30
The fair value measurement level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The Topic excludes all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Fair value is determined under the hierarchy discussed above. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The following methods and assumptions are used in estimating fair value disclosure for financial instruments: the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and trade payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments; and debt that bears variable interest rates indexed to secured overnight financing rate as administered by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited also approximates fair value as it reprices when market interest rates change.​(11)          BENEFIT PLANSPension planThe Company had a defined benefit pension plan that was terminated in 2024. During 2024, the Company transferred $547,000, which was the amount of residual assets (after satisfying any pension plan liabilities) following termination of the defined benefit pension plan, from the defined benefit pension plan to the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan available for future awards to eligible employees. This amount that was transferred to the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan is recognized as restricted cash on the Company’s balance sheet. During 2025, the Company utilized $92,000 of this restricted cash to fund its 401(k) employer contribution for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024.Information regarding the Company’s defined pension plan prior to its termination in 2024 is provided below:●The Company funded the pension plan in compliance with IRS funding requirements. The pension plan was subject to minimum IRS contribution requirements, but these requirements were able to be satisfied by the use of the pension plan’s existing credit balance. No cash contributions to the pension plan were required or made during 2024. Pension assets and liabilities were measured at fair value (measured in accordance with the guidance described in Note 10).●Net periodic pension cost was comprised of the following components (in thousands):​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,  ​    2024Interest cost on projected benefit obligation​$ 6Expected return on assets​  (69)Plan expenses​  152Recognized net actuarial loss​  2Net periodic pension cost​$ (91)Settlement and related expenses​​ 247Net periodic pension cost after settlement​$ 338​●Assumptions used in determining net periodic pension cost and the pension benefit obligation were:​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,​ ​    2024    Discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost  4.51%  Discount rate used to determine pension benefit obligation N/A​Expected long-term rate of return on assets used for pension cost on assets  7.75%  ​The expected return on assets for the pension plan was based on management’s expectation of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considered historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the pension plan was invested, as well as current economic and market conditions.31
●The actuarial gains of $126,000 for 2024 were plan experience gains. The following table sets forth changes in the pension plan’s benefit obligation and assets, and summarizes components of amounts recognized in the Company’s balance sheet (in thousands):​​​​​​​April 30,  ​    2024Change in benefit obligation: ​  Benefit obligation at beginning of year​$ 283Service cost​​ 152Interest cost​  6Actuarial gain​  (126)Benefits paid​  (315)Benefit obligation at end of year​$ —Change in plan assets:​   Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year​$ 1,030Actual return on plan assets​  (8)Plan transfer​​ (547)Benefits paid​  (315)Plan expenses​  (160)Fair value of plan assets at end of year​$ —Funded status​$ —​Information regarding comprehensive income (loss) related to the pension plan is provided below:​●During 2024, the Company did not record any accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which had not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension costs.

The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive loss of $1,230,000 in 2025 and other comprehensive income of $60,000 in 2024. In connection with the termination of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan, $1,230,000 of income tax effects that remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were reclassified to a benefit for income taxes during 2025.​401(k) and Simple IRASince March 2024, the Company has provided a 401(k) with a profit sharing plan as a retirement plan for eligible employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their annual pre-tax compensation, the Company will contribute 3% of each eligible employee’s annual pre-tax compensation each year and the Company may make discretionary contributions to eligible employees on a profit sharing basis. The Company accrued $39,000 and $10,000 for 2025 and 2024 for its 401(k) employer contribution. The Company utilized $92,000 of restricted cash to fund its 401(k) employer contribution for the calendar year ended December 31, 2024.In 2024, the Company provided a Simple IRA plan as a retirement plan for eligible employees. The Company’s Simple IRA plan was terminated in December 2023. Under the plan, eligible employees were permitted to contribute a portion of their annual pre-tax 32
compensation with the Company matching such contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of each contributing employee’s annual pre-tax compensation. The Company’s employer contribution for the Simple IRA was $88,000 for 2024.Equity compensation plan The AMREP Corporation 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the “ Equity Plan”) authorizes stock-based awards of various kinds to non-employee directors and employees covering up to a total of 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The Equity Plan will expire by its terms on, and no award will be granted under the Equity Plan on or after, September 19, 2026. As of April 30, 2025, the Company has issued 141,501 shares of common stock of the Company under the Equity Plan and has reserved for issuance 117,226 shares of common stock of the Company under the Equity Plan upon exercise of issued and outstanding deferred common share units and an option to purchase shares, resulting in 241,273 shares of common stock of the Company available for issuance under the Equity Plan.Shares of restricted common stock that are issued under the Equity Plan (“restricted shares”) are considered to be issued and outstanding as of the grant date and have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock. Compensation expense related to the restricted shares is recognized over the vesting period of each grant based on the fair value of the shares as of the date of grant. The fair value of each grant of restricted shares is determined based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock on the date of such grant, and this amount will be charged to expense over the vesting term of the grant. Forfeitures are recognized as reversals of compensation expense on the date of forfeiture.The restricted share award activity for 2025 and 2024 was as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​Weighted Average​​Number of​Grant Date Fair ValueRestricted share awards     Shares    Per ShareNon-vested as of May 1, 2023  26,267​​ 10.53Granted during 2024  16,400​  19.23 Vested during 2024  (12,199)​  9.68Forfeited during 2024  —​​ —Non-vested as of April 30, 2024  30,468​​ 15.55Granted during 2025  16,140​  21.79Vested during 2025  (14,666)​  14.27Forfeited during 2025  —​​ —Non-vested as of April 30, 2025​ 31,942​​ 19.29​The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to the vesting of restricted shares of common stock net of forfeitures of $311,000 and $237,000 for 2025 and 2024. As of April 30, 2025, there was $287,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted shares of common stock previously issued under the Equity Plan which had not vested, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting term not to exceed three years. 33
In November 2021, the Company granted Christopher V. Vitale, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, an option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company under the Equity Plan with an exercise price of $14.24 per share, which was the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The option will become exercisable for 100% of the option shares on November 1, 2026 if Mr. Vitale is employed by, or providing service to, the Company on such date. Subject to the definitions in the Equity Plan, in the event (a) Mr. Vitale has a termination of employment with the Company on account of death or disability, (b) the Company terminates Mr. Vitale’s employment with the Company for any reason other than cause or (c) of a change in control, then the option will become immediately exercisable for 100% of the option shares. The option has a term of ten years from the date of grant and terminates at the expiration of that period. The option automatically terminates upon: (i) the expiration of the three month period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if the termination of his employment by Mr. Vitale or the Company is for any reason other than as hereinafter set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv); (ii) the expiration of the one year period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company on account of Mr. Vitale’s disability; (iii) the expiration of the one year period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if Mr. Vitale dies while employed by the Company; or (iv) the date on which Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if the termination is for cause. If Mr. Vitale engages in conduct that constitutes cause after Mr. Vitale’s employment terminates, the option immediately terminates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the option be exercised after the date that is immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Except as described above, any portion of the option that is not exercisable at the time Mr. Vitale has a termination of employment with the Company immediately terminates. The fair value of the option was $252,000 as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes fair value option valuation model. The following assumptions were used for determining the fair value of the option: expected volatility of 38.04%; average risk-free interest rate of 1.46%; dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 7.5 years. As of April 30, 2025, the option has not been exercised, cancelled or forfeited. The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to the option of $50,000 in each of 2025 and 2024. As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the option was in-the-money and therefore was included in “weighted average number of common shares outstanding – diluted” when calculating diluted earnings per share.On December 31, 2024 and 2023, each non-employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors was issued the number of deferred common share units of the Company under the Equity Plan equal to $30,000 divided by the closing price per share of Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on such date. Based on the closing price per share of $31.40 and $21.97 on December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company issued a total of 2,865 and 4,095 deferred common share units to members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Each deferred common share unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock within 30 days after the first day of the month to follow such director’s termination of service as a director of the Company. Director compensation non-cash expense, which is recognized for the annual grant of deferred common share units to non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors ratably over the director’s service in office during the calendar year, was $90,000 for each of 2025 and 2024. At April 30, 2025 and 2024, there was $30,000 of accrued compensation expense related to the deferred stock units expected to be issued in December of the following fiscal year.(12)        INCOME TAXES The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,  ​    2025    2024Current: ​   ​  Federal​$ (994)​$ 249State and local​  (66)​  75​​  (1,060)​  324Deferred:​ ​​ ​Federal​  2,082​  1,181State and local​  (13)​  230​​  2,069​  1,411Total provision for income taxes​$ 1,009​$ 1,735​34

The valuation allowance relates primarily to deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, in states where the Company either has no current operations or its operations are not considered likely to realize the deferred tax assets due to the amount of the applicable state net operating loss or its expected expiration date.The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $32,471,000 as of April 30, 2025, which do not have an expiration. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $44,668,000 as of April 30, 2025 that expire beginning in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2038.Net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to audit and possible adjustment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), which could result in a reversal of none, part or all of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the amount recorded. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, the Company may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome will be or the amount of the tax benefit the Company will receive, if any. Under federal income tax law, net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period and the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited to 80% of taxable income in any year during the carryforward period. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if the Company experiences an “ownership change.” A Section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more shareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5% of the Company’s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws in the United States. It is possible that any future ownership changes could have a material effect on the use of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes.The following table reconciles taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from continuing operations to the Company’s actual tax provision (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended April 30,  ​    2025    2024Computed tax provision at statutory rate​$ 2,876​$ 1,811Increase (reduction) in tax resulting from:​ ​​ ​Deferred tax rate changes​  64​  (63)Change in valuation allowances​  (56)​  138State income taxes, net of federal income tax effect​  499​  472Permanent items​​ (258)​​ —Other comprehensive loss, net of tax​​ (1,230)​​ —Other​  (886)​  (623)Actual tax provision (benefit)​$ 1,009​$ 1,735​35
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and various state and local income taxes. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and require significant judgment to apply. Federal tax returns prior to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 are no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. State tax returns prior to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 are no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations. ASC Topic 740 (Income Taxes) clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions, prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized and providing guidance on the derecognition, measurement, classification and disclosure relating to income taxes. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits for 2025 and 2024.The Company has elected to include interest and penalties in its income tax expense. The Company had no accrued interest or penalties as of April 30, 2025 and 2024.​(13)        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLease CommitmentsThe Company leases an office and office equipment in Pennsylvania and office equipment in New Mexico. The leases are generally non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term of two to five years. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of April 30, 2025, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $39,000 and $42,000. As of April 30, 2024, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $67,000 and $69,000. Total operating lease expense was $58,000 and $60,000 for 2025 and 2024. Remaining operating lease payments for these leases subsequent to April 30, 2025 are $29,000 in fiscal year 2026 and $9,000 in fiscal year 2027. Remaining operating lease payments had imputed interest resulting in a present value of these lease liabilities of $36,000 as of April 30, 2025. For 2025, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate of the Company’s operating leases were 1.34 years and 5.50%. For 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate of the Company’s operating leases were 2.34 years and 5.50%. The lease contracts for the Company generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. For these contracts, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on information available upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02. The Company applied a consistent method in periods after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to estimate the incremental borrowing rate.Warranty ReservesThe Company’s homebuilding business provides homebuyers with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to 10 years. The Company’s homebuilding work is performed by subcontractors who must agree to indemnify the Company with regard to their work and provide certificates of insurance demonstrating that they have met the Company’s insurance requirements and have named the Company as an additional insured under their policies. Therefore, many claims relating to workmanship and materials that result in warranty spending are the primary responsibility of these subcontractors.Warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses within the consolidated balance sheets, and the provision for warranty accruals is included in home sale cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Reserves covering anticipated warranty expenses are recorded for each home closed and are a function of the number of home closings in the period, the selling prices of the homes closed and the rates of accrual per home estimated as a percentage of the selling price of the home. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of warranty reserves based on historical experience and the expected costs to remediate potential claims. In addition, the analysis also includes the existence of any non-recurring or community-specific warranty-related matters that might not be included in historical data and trends that may need to be separately estimated based on management’s judgment of the ultimate cost of repair for that specific issue. While estimated warranty liabilities are adjusted each reporting period based on the results of this assessment, the Company may not accurately predict actual warranty costs, which could lead to significant changes in the reserve and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.The Company maintains third-party insurance, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, for most construction defects that the Company encounters in the normal course of business. The Company believes that its warranty reserves, subcontractor indemnities and third-party insurance are adequate to cover the ultimate resolution of any potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation. However, there can be no assurance that: the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by homebuyers; the Company will be able to renew its insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates; the Company will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs or the expense of litigation surrounding 36
possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims; or claims will not arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance or not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors.Changes in warranty reserves are as follows (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​    Year Ended April 30,​​2025    2024Balance at beginning of period​$ 174​$ 165Warranty issued during period​  105​  87Change in pre-existing reserves​  —​  (66)Warranty expenditures during period​  (20)​  (12)Balance at end of period​$ 259​$ 174​Security for Performance ObligationsThe Company is required from time to time to provide security (such as letters of credit, reserve letters, surety bonds or cash collateral) for performance obligations in support of the Company’s land development and homebuilding obligations to municipalities related to the construction of improvements in subdivisions. Cash collateral on deposit with municipalities is included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event any letter of credit, reserve letter or surety bond is drawn, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, reserve letter or surety bond. As of April 30, 2025, the Company had (a) loan reserves outstanding under its Revolving Line of Credit in the aggregate principal amount of $1,812,000 in favor of a municipality guarantying the completion of improvements in a subdivision being constructed by the Company and (b) cash collateral of $229,000 on deposit with a municipality. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had one letter of credit outstanding under its Revolving Line of Credit in the aggregate principal amount of $172,000 in favor of a municipality guarantying the completion of improvements in a subdivision being constructed by the Company and cash collateral of $241,000 on deposit with municipalities.LitigationThe Company may be subject to various lawsuits and legal claims. Certain of the liabilities resulting from these actions may be covered in whole or in part by insurance. The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and legal claims when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable. The Company accrues for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revises these estimates as the matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. To the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any lawsuit or legal claim exceeds the estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, the Company would incur additional charges and these charges might be significant. The Company cannot predict or determine with certainty the timing or final outcome of any lawsuit or legal claim or the effect that any adverse findings or determinations in any lawsuit or legal claim may have on the Company. The legal costs associated with any lawsuit or legal claim and the amount of time required to be spent by management and the Company’s Board of Directors on these matters, even if the Company is ultimately successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company has not accrued any amounts related to litigation matters as of April 30, 2025 or April 30, 2024.(14)         EARNINGS PER SHAREEarnings per share – basic is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period includes shares issuable upon settlement of deferred stock units but does not include unvested shares of restricted common stock or shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options. The components of earnings per share – basic are as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​    Year Ended April 30,​​2025    2024Numerator: ​   ​  Net income​$ 12,716​$ 6,690​​​​​​​Denominator:​   ​   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – basic​  5,318​  5,300​​​​​​​Earnings per share – basic​$ 2.39​$ 1.26​37
Earnings per share – diluted is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of (1) the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus (2) the dilutive effects of unvested shares of restricted common stock, shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are in-the-money and other potentially dilutive instruments. The components of earnings per share – diluted are as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):​​​​​​​​​    Year Ended April 30,​​2025    2024Numerator: ​   ​  Net income​$ 12,716​$ 6,690​​​​​​​Denominator:​   ​   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – basic​  5,318​  5,300Dilutive effect of unvested shares of restricted common stock​  31​  30Dilutive effect of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are in-the-money​  20​  17Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – diluted​  5,369​  5,347​​​​​​​Earnings per share – diluted​$ 2.37​$ 1.25​​(15)        INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRY SEGMENTSThe Company manages its operations through two reportable segments: land development and homebuilding. The land development segment develops residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use, including land and site planning, obtaining governmental and environmental approvals (“entitlements”), installing utilities and storm drains, ensuring the availability of water service, building or improving roads necessary for land development and constructing community amenities. The homebuilding segment focuses on building and selling single-family detached and attached homes. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its President and Chief Executive Officer. The two segments have been identified based on the way in which financial information is regularly reviewed by the CODM to assess financial performance and allocate resources. The CODM uses each segment’s profit (loss) in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company incurs general and administrative expenses associated with certain corporate functions, which are not specific to a particular segment. ​38

Item 9.          Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.​Item 9A.        Controls and ProceduresThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. As a result of such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 30, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Company believes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.The report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Part II, “Item 8.
