GEVO, INC._December 31, 20240001392380FYtrueP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YP1YGevo, Inc. (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this "Amendment") to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 27, 2025 (the "Original Filing"). This Amendment is being filed solely to amend Part II "Item 9B. Other Information" by adding Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements entered into by each of Angelo Amorelli and Gary W. Mize, directors of the Company, during the three months ended December 31, 2024, which were inadvertently omitted from the disclosure included in the Original Filing.
In addition, as required by Rule 12b-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), new certifications by the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer are filed herewith as exhibits to this Amendment, under Item 15 hereof, pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amendment and this Amendment does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. The Company is also not including new certifications under Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), as no financial statements are being filed with this Amendment.
Other than as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment does not, and does not purport to, amend, update or restate the information in the Original Filing or reflect any events that have occurred after the Original Filing was made. Information in the Original Filing not affected by this Amendment remains unchanged and reflects the disclosures made at the time as of which the Original Filing was made. No changes have been made to the financial statements of the Company as contained in the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read together with the Original Filing and the Company's other filings with the SEC.0001392380gevo:PaulD.BloomMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:PaulD.BloomMembergevo:PlanFebruary202025ToFebruary192026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:PatrickR.GruberMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:PatrickR.GruberMembergevo:PlanFebruary172025ToFebruary162026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:L.LynnSmullMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:L.LynnSmullMembergevo:PlanFebruary262025ToFebruary252026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:KimberlyT.BowronMembergevo:PlanMarch32025ToMarch42026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:KimberlyT.BowronMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:GaryW.MizeMembergevo:PlanMay232025ToMay222026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:ChristopherM.RyanMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:ChristopherM.RyanMembergevo:PlanFebruary262025ToFebruary252026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:AngeloAmorelliMembergevo:PlanMarch72025ToMarch62026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:AndrewL.ShaferMembergevo:PlanNovember12024ToOctober312025Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:AndrewL.ShaferMembergevo:PlanFebruary202025ToFebruary192026Member2024-12-310001392380gevo:PaulD.BloomMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:PatrickR.GruberMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:L.LynnSmullMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:KimberlyT.BowronMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:ChristopherM.RyanMembergevo:PlanJuly262024ToJuly252025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:AndrewL.ShaferMembergevo:PlanNovember12024ToOctober312025Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:PaulD.BloomMembergevo:PlanFebruary202025ToFebruary192026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:PatrickR.GruberMembergevo:PlanFebruary172025ToFebruary162026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:L.LynnSmullMembergevo:PlanFebruary262025ToFebruary252026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:KimberlyT.BowronMembergevo:PlanMarch32025ToMarch42026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:GaryW.MizeMembergevo:PlanMay232025ToMay222026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:ChristopherM.RyanMembergevo:PlanFebruary262025ToFebruary252026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:AngeloAmorelliMembergevo:PlanMarch72025ToMarch62026Member2024-10-012024-12-310001392380gevo:AndrewL.ShaferMembergevo:PlanFebruary202025ToFebruary192026Member2024-10-012024-12-3100013923802024-10-012024-12-3100013923802024-06-3000013923802025-01-3100013923802024-01-012024-12-31xbrli:sharesiso4217:USD​​​UNITED STATESSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONWashington, D.C. 20549FORM 10-K/A(Amendment No. 1)​☒ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934​For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024​OR☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934​For the transition period from                      to                     ​Commission file number: 001-35073​GEVO, INC.(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)​​​Delaware87-0747704(State or other jurisdiction ofincorporation or organization)(I.R.S.
