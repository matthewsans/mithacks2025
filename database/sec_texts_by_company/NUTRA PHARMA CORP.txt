Introduction
Nutra
Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company with intellectual property for drugs that treat autoimmune disorders, viral diseases and pain.
Nutra Pharma was incorporated under the laws of the state of California on February 1, 2000, under the original name of Exotic-Bird.com.
Nutra
Pharma conducts drug discovery research and development (R&D) activities. In October 2009, Nutra Pharma launched its first consumer
product called Cobroxin, an over-the-counter pain reliever designed to treat moderate to severe chronic pain. In May 2010, Nutra Pharma
launched its second consumer product called Nyloxin, an over-the-counter pain reliever that is a stronger version of Cobroxin and is
designed to treat severe chronic pain. In December 2014, we launched Pet Pain-Away, an over-the-counter pain reliever designed to treat
pain in cats and dogs. In October 2019, we launched Equine Pain-Away, an over-the-counter topical pain reliever designed to treat pain
in horses. In March of 2021, we launched Luxury Feet, an over-the-counter pain reliever and anti-inflammatory
product that is designed for women who experience pain or discomfort due to high heels and stilettos. In October of 2021 we began manufacturing
private labelled products for third party distributors.
We
have conducted our operations since October 2003. We are a biopharmaceutical company that engages in the acquisition, licensing and commercialization
of pharmaceutical products and technologies as well as homeopathic and ethical drugs for the management of pain, neurological disorders,
cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases. Homeopathic drugs are natural products that contain ingredients listed in the HPUS (Homeopathic
Pharmacopoeia of the United States). An ethical drug is a licensed drug that has obtained Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”)
approval after extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. We seek strategic licensing partnerships to reduce the risks associated with
the drug development process.
We
have carried out our homeopathic and drug discovery research and clinical development and fully developed four homeopathic drugs for
the relief of pain:
●
Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength
●
Pet Pain-Away: an over-the-counter pain reliever designed
to relieve pain in cats and dogs
●
Equine Pain-Away: an over-the-counter topical pain
reliever designed to relieve pain in horses
●
Luxury Feet: an over-the-counter pain reliever designed
to relieve foot pain from high heels and stilettos
Our
business plan will continue its efforts to produce, market and distribute our Nyloxin, Pet Pain-Away, Equine Pain-Away™ and Luxury
Feet™ branded products both domestically and internationally.
From
October 2009 until December 31, 2022, our operations centered on the marketing of Cobroxin (our discontinued product), Nyloxin and Nyloxin
Extra Strength. In December of 2014, we launched Pet Pain-Away and began actively marketing the product. In October of 2021, we began
manufacturing a Zeolite detoxification product and conducted some online sales. We launched Equine Pain-Away in October of 2019 and Luxury
Feet officially launched distribution in March of 2021.
Additionally,
the Company has developed two drug candidates:
●
RPI-78M, to treat neurological
diseases and autoimmune diseases, including; Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Myasthenia Gravis; and
●
RPI-MN, to treat viral
diseases, including HIV/AIDS and Herpes.
The
Company has developed proprietary therapeutic protein products primarily for the prevention and treatment of viral and neurological diseases,
including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and pain in humans. These potential
products are subject to FDA approval. In September of 2015 we were granted Orphan Designation by the US-FDA for the treatment of Pediatric
Multiple Sclerosis. The Orphan designation may greatly reduce the costs of clinical trials and shorten the timeline to potential drug
approval.
The
Company is also pursuing the use of our technology as a potential nerve agent countermeasure that may protect war fighters from chemical
weapon attacks on the battlefield.
We
continue to identify biotechnology related intellectual property and companies with which we may potentially be able to enter into arrangements,
agreements or to potentially acquire.

Industry
Overview of the Pain Market
Pain
is the most common symptom for patients seeking medical attention. Acute and chronic pain affects large numbers of Americans. According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “..an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults (51.6 million persons) experienced
chronic pain, and 6.9% (17.1 million persons) experienced high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that results in substantial restriction
to daily activities)”. The annual national economic cost associated with chronic pain is estimated to be $560-$635 billion. (Institute
of Medicine, Relieving Pain in America, 2011).
According
to the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), chronic pain affects approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide, on account of the high
prevalence of cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and diabetes. Algomedix
estimated the global sales for the treatment of chronic pain were $60 billion in 2015; and according
to the market research report published by P&S Intelligence, the global chronic pain treatment market is expected to reach $105.9
billion by 2025. The market growth is primarily driven by the rising prevalence of chronic conditions, surging geriatric population,
and increasing government support toward chronic pain management.
Our
Products
Nyloxin/Nyloxin
Extra Strength
We
offer Nyloxin/Nyloxin Extra Strength as our over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever that has been clinically proven to treat moderate to
severe (Stage 2) chronic pain.
Nyloxin
and Nyloxin Extra Strength are available as a two-ounce topical gel for treating joint pain and pain associated with arthritis and repetitive
stress, and as a one ounce oral spray for treating lower back pain, migraines, neck aches, shoulder pain, cramps, and neuropathic pain.
Both the topical gel and oral spray are packaged and sold as a one-month supply.
Nyloxin
and Nyloxin Extra Strength offer several benefits as a pain reliever. With increasing concern about consumers using opioid and acetaminophen-based
pain relievers, the Nyloxin products provide an alternative that does not rely on opiates or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, otherwise
known as NSAIDs, for their pain-relieving effects. Nyloxin also has a well-defined safety profile. Since the early 1930s, the active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Nyloxin, Asian cobra venom, has been studied in more than 46 human clinical studies. The data from
these studies provide clinical evidence that cobra venom provides an effective treatment for pain with few side effects and has the following
benefits:
●
safe and effective;
●
all natural;
●
long-acting;
●
easy to use;
●
non-narcotic;
●
non-addictive; and
●
analgesic and anti-inflammatory.
Potential
side effects from the use of Nyloxin are rare, but may include headache, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, allergic rhinitis and coughing.
The
primary difference between Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength is the dilution level of the venom. The approximate dilution levels for
Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength are as follows:
Nyloxin
●
Topical Gel: 30 mcg/mL
●
Oral Spray: 70 mcg/mL
Nyloxin
Extra Strength
●
Topical Gel: 60 mcg/mL
●
Oral Spray: 140 mcg/mL
In
December 2011, we began marketing Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength at www.nyloxin.com. Both Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength are
packaged in a roll-on container, squeeze bottle and as an oral spray. Additionally, Nyloxin topical gel is available in an 8 ounce pump
bottle.
4
We
are currently marketing Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength as treatments for moderate to severe chronic pain. Nyloxin is available as
an oral spray for treating back pain, neck pain, headaches, joint pain, migraines, and neuralgia and as a topical gel for treating joint
pain, neck pain, arthritis pain, and pain associated with repetitive stress. Nyloxin Extra Strength is available as an oral spray and
gel application for treating the same physical indications but is aimed at treating the most severe (Stage 3) pain that inhibits one’s
ability to function fully.
The
Nyloxin products are available for sale on the www.Nyloxin.com website, the Nyloxin Amazon storefront at www.Amazon.com/nyloxin and on
the Walmart Marketplace. Nyloxin is also sold in physician offices, clinics and small-chain pharmacies.
Nyloxin
Military Strength
In
December 2012, we announced the availability of Nyloxin Military Strength for sale to the United States Military and Veteran’s
Administration. Over the past few years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been reporting an increase in the use and abuse of prescription
medications, particularly opiates. In 2009, close to 3.8 million prescriptions for pain relievers were written in the military. This
staggering number was more than a 400% increase from the number of prescriptions written in the military in 2001. But prescription drugs
are not the only issue. The most common and seemingly harmless way to treat pain is with non–steroidal, anti–inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDS). But there are risks. Overuse can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, ulcers and internal bleeding. In severe
cases chest pain, heart failure, kidney dysfunction and life–threatening allergic reactions can occur. It is reported that approximately
7,600 people in America die from NSAID use and some 78,000 are hospitalized. Ibuprofen, also an NSAID has been of particular concern
in the military. The terms “Ranger Candy” and “Military Candy” refer to the service men and women who are said
to use 800mg doses of Ibuprofen to control their pain. But when taking anti–inflammatory Ibuprofen in high doses for chronic pain,
there is potential for critical health risks; abuse can lead to serious stomach problems, internal bleeding and even kidney failure.
There are significantly greater health risks when abuse of this drug is combined with alcohol intake. Our goal is that with Nyloxin,
we can greatly reduce the instances of opiate abuse and overuse of NSAIDS in high risk groups like the US military. The Nyloxin Military
Strength represents the strongest version of Nyloxin available and is approximately twice as strong as Nyloxin Extra Strength. We are
working with outside consultants to register Nyloxin Military Strength and the other Nyloxin products for sale to the US government and
the various arms of the military as well as the Veteran’s Administration. In February of 2018, Nyloxin was added to the Federal
Supply Schedule but was subsequently removed the following week without an adequate explanation. We have continued to work with our consultants
to understand why our products were improperly removed the Federal Supply Schedule and when we may be able to get re-listed on the Federal
Supply Schedule for eventual sales to governmental agencies or to the US Military.
International
Sales
We
are pursuing international drug registrations in Canada, Mexico, India, Australia, New Zealand, Central and South America and Europe.
Since European rules for homeopathic drugs are different than the rules in the US, we cannot estimate when this process will be completed.
On March 25, 2013 we announced the publication of our patent and trademark for Nyloxin in India. We are actively seeking new distribution
partners in India.
On
May 14, 2015 we announced that we had engaged the Nature’s Clinic to begin the process of regulatory approval of our Company’s
Over–the–Counter pain drug, Nyloxin for marketing and distribution in Canada. The Nature’s Clinic has already begun
setting up their Chatham, Ontario warehouse. Due to lack of funding and then the subsequent COVID crisis, we have waited to complete
the approval process to begin distributing Nyloxin and expect to re-engage in the process in 2026.
Additionally,
we plan to complete several human clinical studies aimed at comparing the ability of Nyloxin Extra Strength to replace prescription pain
relievers. We have provided protocols to several hospitals and will provide details and timelines when those protocols have been accepted.
We cannot provide any timeline for these studies until adequate financing is available.
To
date, our marketing efforts have been limited due to lack of funding. As sales increase, we plan to begin marketing more aggressively
to increase the sales and awareness of our products.
5
Pet
Pain–Away
During
June of 2013, we announced the launch of our new homeopathic formula for the treatment of chronic pain in companion animals, Pet Pain–Away.
Pet Pain–Away is a homeopathic, non–narcotic, non–addictive, over–the–counter pain reliever, primarily
aimed at treating moderate to severe chronic pain in companion animals. It is specifically indicated to treat pain from hip dysplasia,
arthritis pain, joint pain, and general chronic pain in dogs and cats. The initial product run was completed in December of 2014 and
launched through Lumaxa Distributors on December 19, 2014.
In
May of 2016, we signed a license agreement to begin the process of creating an infomercial (Direct Response) campaign for Pet Pain–Away.
In November of 2016, we announced the license agreement with DEG Productions for the marketing and distribution of Pet Pain–Away
globally. DEG created their own website (www.getpetpainaway.com) and began airing commercials in December of 2016.
In
February of 2020, we took back the marketing of Pet Pain-Away and are currently selling the product on Amazon.com and through www.petpainaway.com
Luxury
Feet
In
June of 2017, we announced the creation of Luxury Feet; an over–the–counter pain reliever and anti–inflammatory
product that is designed for women who experience pain or discomfort due to high heels and stilettos. We announced the official marketing
launch of Luxury Feet in March of 2021. The product is currently available through www.luxuryfeet.com and on Amazon.
Equine
Pain-Away (Formerly Equine Nyloxin)
In
October of 2013, we announced that we were in the process of launching the newest addition to our line of homeopathic treatments for
chronic pain, Equine Nyloxin. We had been working with trainers and veterinarians in the equine industry and have already identified
distributors for the product. The Equine Nyloxin represents the Company’s first topical solution for the animal market.
Equine Nyloxin was rebranded as Equine Pain-Away™ and officially rolled into the market in October of 2019. Equine Pain-Away is
being marketed through several retailers and online at www.EquinePainAway.com and on Amazon.
Regulation
The
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in our over the counter products, Asian cobra venom, has an approved United States monograph under
the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS), which allowed us to register them with the FDA as homeopathic drugs. A United
States monograph is a prescribed formulation for the production of any drug or product that is recognized by law for a specific application
and that may be introduced into commerce. The FDA requires this registration process to maintain full compliance of companies marketing
and selling medicines classified as homeopathic. In August 2009, we successfully completed submission of final packaging and labeling
to the FDA to begin selling our over-the-counter pain reliever, Cobroxin. In December 2009, we completed our submission of final packaging
and labeling to the FDA of Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength. In December 2016 we completed our submission of final packaging and labeling
to the FDA of Pet Pain-Away.
On
March 11, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent us a warning letter regarding the claims and marketing materials
of our Nyloxin line of products. On April 10, 2019 we responded to the warning letter; addressing their concerns and outlining the actions
that we have taken and will take to comply with their requests for changes. The response goes on to commit to the FDA that the company
will make the changes necessary to properly and legally continue to market and distribute our products. As of this date, we have made
all of the committed changes to our website, social media pages and marketing material. There has been no further communication regarding
this from the FDA.
6
Manufacturing
We
oversee Nyloxin’s and Pet Pain-Away’s manufacturing activities at our Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) certified
facility. We are also responsible for acquiring appropriate amounts of Asian cobra venom required to manufacture Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away.
Subject
to availability of funds, we plan to begin additional clinical studies for our pain relievers. These studies will be designed to compare
the efficacy of Nyloxin Extra Strength to other prescription strength pain relievers. Our study published in Toxicon, which is
the journal of the International Society of Toxinology, showed that our leading drug product for the treatment of pain (RPI-78) had pain-reducing
effects that lasted four times as long as morphine without the negative side effects associated with opioid-based pain relievers. Another
study published in the journal Neuropharmacology showed a new mechanism on the use of Alpha-Cobratoxin as a treatment for pain. Alpha-Cobratoxin
is the main component of the cobra venom used in Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away.
The
FDA requires those companies manufacturing homeopathic medicines to have their facilities certified as GMP. As of October 2005, our manufacturing
and laboratory facility has been fully compliant with its GMP certification. In March 2009, we received an ISO Class 5 certification
for our clean room facility. An ISO Class 5 certification is a type of classification granted for a clean room facility according to
the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air. An ISO Class 5 clean room has at most, 3,500 particles per square meter.
In 2023, we moved to our new facility in Boca Raton and have certified our lab for production.
Manufacturing
Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away entails a two-step process, the first of which consists of manufacturing the bulk raw materials and completing
the dilution levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) as provided for in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the
United States, which is a compilation of continuously updated statements of Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia standards and monographs as recognized
by that organization. Once this process is completed, the second step entails batching the ingredients into the final mixing, bottling
and shipping processes.
We
began limited manufacturing of Nyloxin in November 2010. We scaled up manufacturing in the first quarter of 2011. Our production level
is contingent upon product demand level and we can scale up as sales demand increases. We began manufacturing Pet Pain-Away in late 2014
and completed the first run of products for distribution on December 19, 2014. We are currently expanding production capacity in our
facility to allow spot production of our products and future private label brands.
In
March of 2022 we announced that we had expanded our manufacturing capabilities to include liquid filling, tube filling as well as capsule
production. We also announced that we had begun scaling up in-house production of dietary supplements for third-party marketers in acting
as a contract manufacturer; Our first such contract was with Avini Health, a related party.
Marketing
and Distribution
In
August 2009, we completed an agreement with XenaCare granting them the exclusive license to market and distribute Cobroxin within the
United States. To maintain this market exclusivity, XenaCare was required to meet certain minimum performance requirements. On April
1, 2011, we notified our Cobroxin Distributor, XenaCare Holdings that they were in breach of our agreement. As a result of this, the
distribution agreement was terminated effective April 10, 2011. XenaCare had a large stock of the product that they had ordered from
us and we have allowed them to continue to market their existing inventory of Cobroxin. In October 2011 we discontinued their website
at www.Cobroxin.com. All current traffic to that website is now redirected to www.Nyloxin.com. It is our plan to eventually re-launch
Cobroxin with an eventual return to retail stores.
In
December of 2013, we announced an agreement with MyNyloxin.com for the exclusive rights to market and distribute Nyloxin in the Network
Marketing channel. In November of 2014, MyNyloxin.com changed their name to Lumaxa. They provide a business opportunity to their Distributors
to earn commissions on the sale of our products through their Distributor groups. In January of 2014, we announced the first product
shipments to the MyNyloxin Independent Entrepreneurs (MIEs). Lumaxa conducts webinars, conference calls and live meetings to support
recruitment of new distributors as well as to provide product and business education.
In
May of 2016, we signed a license agreement to begin the process of creating an infomercial (Direct Response) campaign for Pet Pain-Away.
In November of 2016, we announced the license agreement with DEG Productions for the marketing and distribution of Pet Pain-Away globally.
DEG created their own website (www.getpetpainaway.com) and began airing commercials in December of 2016. In February of 2020, we took
back the marketing of Pet Pain-Away and are currently selling the product on Amazon.com and through www.petpainaway.com
7
In
late 2019 we created our own storefront on Amazon at www.Amazon.com/nyloxin. In August of 2020, we added Pet Pain-Away to the Amazon
site. In March of 2021, we added Luxury Feet and Equine Pain-Away to our Amazon storefront. In November of 2020, our Nyloxin line of
products was added to the Walmart Marketplace and sold online at www.Walmart.com. In March of 2022, we announced that Avini Health would
market our products on a non-exclusive basis while we will act as their contract manufacturer for the rest of their product line. Avini
Health currently markets our products to their Distributors under the brand “Plus Relief”. In October of 2023, we launched
Plus Relief for Pets through Avini Health as a private label of Pet Pain-Away. We continue to work with Avini to market these products.
We
are continuing our efforts to find strategic partnerships for the promotion, marketing, registration, licensing and sales of our products
domestically and internationally.
Dependence
on one or a Few Major Customers
With
respect to Nyloxin, Nyloxin Extra Strength and Pet Pain-Away, we have been distributing the products online and to various retailers.
We are seeking both domestic and international distributors for these products. It may be that a larger distributor may require exclusivity
in the US or any particular foreign market. If so, we would be dependent on that distributor for those Nyloxin sales.
International
Drug Registrations
We
are continuing our efforts to complete the registration process internationally. On March 25, 2013 we announced the publication of our
patent and trademark for Nyloxin in India. We are currently working with potential Distributors in India. In February, 2015 we completed
the first test shipments to India through our importer, S.Zhaveri Pharmakem. We are actively seeking new distribution partners in India.
In April of 2015 we announced the engagement of the Vancouver Commodity Group to identify potential distribution partners in China. Later
that month, we announced the acceptance of Nyloxin by the China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Healthcare
(CPAM). With this approval, we have been working with several groups to find a large distributor for our products in the People’s
Republic of China. On May 14, 2015 we announced that we had engaged the Nature’s Clinic to begin the process of regulatory approval
of our Company’s Over-the-Counter pain drug, Nyloxin for marketing and distribution in Canada. The Nature’s Clinic has already
begun setting up their Chatham, Ontario warehouse. Due to lack of funding, we have waited to complete the approval process to begin distributing
Nyloxin and expect to re-engage in the process as soon as feasible. On February 1, 2018 we announced a Distribution Agreement with the
Australian company, Pharmachal PTY LTD to market and distribute Nyloxin in Australia and New Zealand. Pharmachal has begun the registration
process with the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration). We will continue to work with them through the registration process but have
no current timetable for distribution in Australia.
While
many countries adopt similar regulation to the United States for registering homeopathic drugs, the international application process
is more complex and may be lengthier. We will continue to seek qualified, well-funded distributors for the international distribution
of Cobroxin, Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away. At this time, we have no way of knowing when we may begin the process of marketing and distributing
our products internationally as we navigate the regulatory process and seek qualified distributors.
Homeopathic
Drug Pain Relief Studies
Pending
adequate financing or revenues, we will continue our research and development into this area, with the ultimate goal of improving product
claims for Nyloxin Extra Strength, which is a treatment for stage 3 pain. We have planned the following three studies and will pursue
these pending adequate financing:
MS
Neuropathic Pain Phase IV
This
is a planned 10-week patient trial period. We have thus far incurred costs of $5,000 with a total estimated budget of $130,000. We plan
to reinitiate this trial pending adequate funding.
8
Chronic
Back Pain Phase I
We
will continue our research and development in this area, with the ultimate goal of completing development of our future product, Recet,
which is an injectable version of Cobratoxin. This is a planned 4-week patient trial period. We have thus far incurred costs of $25,000
in prior years with a total estimated budget of $250,000. We plan to reinitiate this trial pending adequate funding.
Chronic
Back Pain Phase IV
We
will continue our research and development, with this ultimate goal of improving product claims for Nyloxin Extra Strength, which is
a treatment for stage 3 pain. This is a planned 4-week patient trial period. We have an estimated budget of $250,000. We have not yet
incurred any costs associated with the Chronic Back Pain Phase IV project. We plan to reinitiate this trial pending adequate funding.
All
of these studies have been delayed due to our lack of revenues and funding. We will reassess our start and completion dates upon generating
a sufficient amount of revenues, if ever.
Research
and Development
We
have conducted research and development of novel anticholinergic therapeutic protein products for the treatment of autoimmune and neurologic
disorders, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
and pain.
Drug
Applications
We
have set forth below a summary of our proposed drugs and their potential applications.
Drug
Potential
Applications
RPI-78M
MS, AMN, Rheumatoid
Arthritis (RA), Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
RPI-MN
HIV, Herpes, general
anti-viral applications
RPI-78
Pain, Arthritis
RPI-70
Pain
We
believe that our pharmaceutical products have a wide range of applications in a number of chronic, inherited and/or life-threatening
viral, autoimmune and neuromuscular degenerative diseases, even though none of these products have FDA or other approval for the treatment
of such diseases. These disorders target nerve cells, especially one specific type of cell receptor that is sensitive to the neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine, which plays an important role in the transmission of nerve impulses at synapses and myoneural (muscle-nerve) junctions.
Primary
Disease Targets
Through
our research program, our goal is to obtain required regulatory approvals of our HIV, MS, and AMN products, so that they can be marketed.
In September of 2015 we were granted Orphan Designation by the US-FDA for the treatment of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. The Orphan designation
may greatly reduce the costs of clinical trials and shorten the timeline to potential drug approval. We secure confidentiality agreements
prior to initiating contract research in order to protect any patentable opportunities.
9
Multiple
Sclerosis (MS)
Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) is thought to be an autoimmune disease that primarily causes central nervous system problems. In MS, the insulating fatty
material surrounding the nerve fibers, also known as myelin, which functions to speed signaling from one end of the nerve cell
to the other, is attacked by cells of the immune system causing problems in signal transduction. MS is the most common of demyelinating
disorders, having a prevalence of approximately 1 per 1,000 persons in most of the United States and Europe. According to the American
Multiple Sclerosis Society, 1,000,000 people in the US are affected by MS and another 2.8 million globally, with 10,000 new cases diagnosed
in the US every year. Although MS occurs most commonly in adults, it is also diagnosed in children and adolescents. A study published
by Emory University School of Medicine analyzed data from 53 countries that submitted pediatric data to the Atlas of MS during 2020-2022,
and estimated that there are over 31,000 children and adolescents living with MS worldwide.
People
with MS may experience diverse signs and symptoms. MS symptoms may include pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment, tremors, loss of coordination
and muscle control, loss of touch sensation, slurred speech and vision impairment. The course of the disease is unpredictable and for
most MS patients, the disease initially manifests a “relapsing-remitting” pattern. Periods of apparent stability are punctuated
by acute exacerbations that are sudden unpredictable episodes that might involve impaired vision, diminished ability to control a limb,
loss of bladder control, or a great variety of other possible neurologic deficits. In relapsing-remitting MS, some or all of the lost
function returns, however, the patient sustains an unceasing, often insidious, accumulation of neuronal damage. As the burden of neural
damage grows, new lesions are more likely to produce irreversible impairment of function. Typically, about eight to fifteen years after
onset, MS patients enter the secondary-progressive phase. Eventually, progressive MS sufferers become wheelchair-bound, and may become
blind and even incapable of speech. There is currently no FDA approved drug that reverses the course of the progressive form of MS.
RPI-78M
has shown efficacy in animal models (EAE) for MS and we are planning new animal studies to gain more insight into the levels of protection
that the drugs afford. In one study conducted in August 2007, all members of an untreated animal control group developed signs of disease
with different levels of paralysis/muscle weakness. A similar group in the August 2007 study treated with RPI-78M showed no disease in
90% of the animals in both acute and chronic applications of the test. Moreover, there were no toxicities reported though the animals
which received doses the equivalent of 280 times a human dose.
Furthermore,
we believe that the ability to modulate the host immunostimulatory environment could form the basis of an effective strategy for the
long-term control of autoimmunity in diseases like MS and Myasthenia gravis (MG) and is being studied as a therapeutic model for other
neuromuscular diseases. Also, we believe our data suggest that it is possible that our novel therapeutic proteins could have a general
application in autoimmune diseases based on human studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis and anecdotal reports from patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
In
August of 1984, Biogenix applied for and received an Intrastate Investigational Drug (FSDHRS Protocol RA-1 (002)) from the Department
of Health and Rehabilitation (HRS) in Florida that permitted the 4-week study of RPI-MN in 13 patients with Rheumatoid arthritis ranging
in age from 49 to 81. Patients were enrolled for a period of 4 weeks; the results showed 30% to 49% improvement in range of joint motion,
early morning stiffness and stamina (this data, along with other supporting intellectual property was acquired by our wholly-owned subsidiary
ReceptoPharm from Biogenix). We believe that the data obtained from the examination of clinical efficacy in these three diseases can
augment information from prior clinical studies and lead to the future investigation of treatments for other chronic conditions.
We
are currently planning two studies in Multiple Sclerosis:
-
Study of 30
adults utilizing RPI-78M with monthly MRIs and disability testing. The goal of this small Phase IIa study would be to see if the
disease modification and reversal that was seen in the rat model is replicated in humans. If sclerosing lesions in the brains of
MS patients are reduced in any way, this would be a first for any MS therapy.
-
Study in 30-50 children
diagnosed with Pediatric MS under our Orphan Designation. The goal of this study would be to utilize the benefits of our Orphan Designation
to prove efficacy in a pediatric population of MS patients.
10
Adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), Pediatric MS and other Orphan Indications
Adrenoleukodystrophy,
or ALD, is a genetically determined neurological disorder that, according to the Adrenoleukodystrophy Foundation, affects 1 in every
17,900 boys worldwide. The presentation of symptoms occurs between the ages of 4 and 10, and affects the brain with demyelination, which
is the stripping away of the fatty coating that keeps nerve pulses confined and maintains the integrity of nerve signals. This process
inhibits the nerves’ ability to conduct properly, which causes neurological deficits, including visual disturbances, auditory discrimination,
impaired coordination, dementia and seizures. Demyelination is an inflammatory response and nerve cells throughout the brain are destroyed.
Adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN) is the most common form of X-ALD, a maternally inherited type of ALD. AMN affects about 40-45% of X-ALD patients and usually presents
itself in adolescence or adult life and may be preceded by hypoadrenalism. It is characterized by spastic paraplegia and a peripheral
neuropathy, often being diagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Nerve conduction studies in AMN show a predominant axonal neuropathy and
show a loss of all axons. Lorenzo’s oil, a mixture of glyceryltrioleate and glyceryltrierucate, has been used for over a decade
in an open, unblinded fashion with mixed results.
RPI-78M
has been utilized in two clinical studies, which were completed at the Charles Dent Metabolic Unit located in London, England. The last
trial was classified as a Phase IIb/IIIa study. These studies provided important safety data, showing RPI-78M to be well tolerated by
the patients. Further study is warranted to provide data on the potential efficacy of RPI-78M to treat the symptoms of AMN.
In
September of 2015, we were granted Orphan Designation by the US-FDA for the treatment of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. We are currently
working with potential sites of care to conduct a Phase I/II in Pediatric MS. The designation of RPI-78M as an Orphan Drug provides Nutra
Pharma with a 7-year period of market exclusivity in the U.S. once the drug is approved. Additional benefits over conventional drug applications
include: tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for grant funding, clinical trial design assistance, plus assistance
from the FDA in the drug development process and the waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fees which could be in excess
of $2.5 million. The granting of Orphan Drug Designation allows the Company to move forward with their preparation of an Investigative
New Drug Application and proposal of clinical trials. The FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation status to products that treat rare diseases,
providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics. According to the FDA, the Orphan Drug program has successfully enabled
the development and marketing of more than 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases since 1983. Evaluate Ltd., in its 2025 EvaluatePharma
Orphan Drug Report, estimated that orphan drug sales will constitute more than 20% of the total share of prescription drug sales by 2030,
totaling $320bn.
In
December of 2015, we announced that we had applied for an Orphan Drug designation from the US-FDA for the Company’s RPI-78M drug
candidate for the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis (MG). The application was subsequently rejected with an offer to re-file in the future
as more data becomes available.
Pain
and Arthritis
Protein
or peptide-based drugs are penetrating the pain market with neurotoxins taking the lead. Botox (Allergan) and Prialt (Elan) have the
potential to substitute over the long-term for morphine and other opiates in chronic pain indications. Opiates, though potent painkillers,
suffer from drawbacks because they are addictive, short acting, and drug-resistance inducing. We plan to assess the effects of several
peptides in animal models of pain in association with Soochow University in China. Several peptides have demonstrated positive effects
and the research and development continues.
August
2007 studies at Soochow University proved the potential of our drug candidates, RPI-78 and RPI-70. When compared to Dolantin, an opiate-based
drug subordinate to morphine, the effects were very encouraging. While Dolantin provided immediate pain relief it began wearing off just
as RPI-70 began to take effect. The effects of RPI-70 do not seem dramatic in contrast to Dolantin, considering the quantity of drug
employed in this animal model. The concentration of RPI-70 was approximately 100 times less than the opiate product. Also, RPI-70 showed
real potential for combining with other pain killing medications. RPI-78 was calculated to be 150,000 times more potent than aspirin.
This product can be injected systemically providing evidence of a more practical application than Prialt, which must be administered
intrathecally (into the spinal cord). Opiate drugs induce tolerance and dependence. This problem is not encountered with RPI-70 and RPI-78.
11
In
February 2009, we filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the use of RPI-78 as a novel method
for treating arthritis in humans. Also in February 2009, in collaboration with Soochow University in China, we published positive data
from its recent animal studies on the use of RPI-78 (Cobratoxin) as a method for treating arthritis. In March of 2011, we were issued
a patent for the use of cobratoxin as an analgesic (US patent #7,902,152). In February of 2012, in collaboration with Soochow University,
we published another study that demonstrated a novel mechanism of action for the use of RPI-78 as a treatment for pain.
Nerve
Agent Countermeasures
In
February of 2018, we announced that we had filed a new provisional patent to protect our intellectual property surrounding the development
of nerve agent counter measures. In much the same way that our therapies protect the nerves of patients with disease, our findings indicate
that we may protect against – or at least mitigate the damage caused by - nerve agents that are utilized as chemical weapons; such
as sarin gas and VX. We will be working with experts in the field to have our products in testing shortly.
Nerve
agents are identified as a class of phosphorus-containing organic chemicals (organophosphates) that may disrupt the transfer of messages
to organs through the nerves. This disruption is caused by the over-stimulation of certain receptors on the surface of the neurons. These
same receptors are the target of Nutra Pharma’s drugs, which may block the action of the nerve agents or minimize the damage that
they may cause.
The
company has very encouraging preclinical data, a demonstrated molecular mechanism of action and a robust scientific rational for the
continued commercial development of its nerve agent counter measure. Organophosphate nerve agents such as VX and Sarin remain a troubling
threat to American service people and civilians as evidenced by the recent attacks in Syria, Malaysia and London. Supply chain issues
with existing counter measures and the safety and effectiveness of these drugs is a great concern. Based on our pre-clinical studies
and experience in neurobiology products, we believe that we have a superior product ready for testing in the near term.
On
September 22, 2020, Dr. Dale VanderPutten, our Chief Scientific Officer was invited by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to
present our nerve agent countermeasure technology in a Tech Watch talk to an audience of military and civilian experts in chem/bio defense.
The talk titled “A Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR) Directed Organophosphate Countermeasure” was presented in a virtual
internet meeting to a select expert audience invited by DTRA. The consensus of the comments and questions on the presentation supported
the idea that despite past efforts, there remains an unmet need for nAChR directed defenses and that our demonstration of human safety
in the clinic and pre-clinical proof of concept deserves aggressive follow up.
According
to a BBC report, chemical weapons remain a real threat to the West. During the Syrian conflict
there were over a thousand documented uses of chemical weapons; making this issue a major topic of concern in the US department of Defense
and the United Nations. We will continue working with the Department of Defense and DTRA on potential funding for these applications.
Market
Values
Multiple
Sclerosis (MS)
As
of 2023, MS affects an estimated 2.9 million people globally with approximately 1,000,000 sufferers in the United States. There are 15
approved drugs for the treatment of this disease. According to Precedence Research, the U.S. multiple sclerosis drugs market size accounted
for $7.81 billion in 2024 and is predicted to increase from $8.44 billion in 2025 to approximately $17.15 billion by 2034, expanding
at a CAGR of 8.18% from 2025 to 2034. The global multiple sclerosis drugs market size accounted for $21.26 billion in 2024 and is predicted
to increase from $22.96 billion in 2025 to approximately $45.90 billion by 2034, expanding at a CAGR of 8.00% from 2025 to 2034. The
growth of the market is driven by ongoing clinical trials, increasing approvals from regulatory agencies, and rising investments in R&D
activities for developing new therapies. According to an April 2015 article published in the journal Neurology, the average annual
cost of these drugs has increased to over $60,000 per person. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as of February 2022,
the median annual price of a brand-name disease-modifying therapy was close to $94,000.
12
Adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN)
AMN/ALD
affects an estimated 30,000 people in the US with some estimates exceeding this number.
Pediatric
Multiple Sclerosis (pediatric-MS)
According
to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, although MS occurs most commonly in adults, it is also diagnosed in children and adolescents.
Estimates suggest that 8,000-10,000 children (up to 18 years old) in the United States have MS, and another 10,000-15,000 have experienced
at least one symptom suggestive of MS. Studies suggest that two to five percent of all people with MS have a history of symptom onset
before age 18.
Myasthenia
Gravis (MG)
According
to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, the prevalence of MG in the United States is estimated to be about 64,000 patients. However,
MG is probably under diagnosed and the prevalence may be higher.
Business
Strategy
Pending
adequate financing or revenues, we seek to develop proprietary pharmaceutical products for human illnesses that qualify for “Fast-Track”
or “Orphan Drug” status under FDA regulations, which can expedite regulatory review. For some conditions, the FDA has created
the “two animal rule” which permits us to collect data from ongoing animal research for human treatment applications.
We
believe the results from our research will assist in getting our applications processed through the FDA’s “Fast-Track”
approval process and enable us to plan the commercialization of each product independently and/or through joint ventures, partnerships
and licensing arrangements. “Fast-Track” denotes life-threatening illnesses, while “Orphan” status refers to
serious ailments affecting less than 200,000 individuals nationwide. AMN qualifies under both labels because it is considered an orphan
disease and has no known cure. Pediatric MS and Myasthenia Gravis are also considered “Orphan” diseases because of the disease
prevalence as well as the lack of effective therapies.
We
believe that our proposed unique pharmaceutical products can be used alone or licensed for use in combination with other therapeutic
products and may be of interest to other established pharmaceutical companies as a means of extending the patent life of their proprietary
products.
Short-term
Goal
Although
we focused our drug development efforts from 2006 to 2008 on clinical trials for ReceptoPharm’s HIV drug, RPI-MN, our primary focus
now is on RPI-78M for the treatment of MS and MG. With the Orphan designation for Pediatric MS, we expect to move into Phase I/II clinical
studies by the end of 2025.
Mid-term
Goal
Our
midterm strategy is to license our AMN, MS and HIV technologies in our attempt to bring these technologies to market within 5 years,
should we obtain adequate financing.
Long-Term
Goal
Our
long-term goal is the use of our drugs in the field of neurological diseases, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. Due to our
limited financial and operational resources, this goal will require us to establish strategic partners or alliances with pharmaceutical
companies, academic institutions, biotechnology companies, and clinical diagnostic laboratories, which will: (a) complement our research
and development efforts; (b) reduce the risks associated with undertaking the entire process of drug development and marketing; and (c)
generate licensing based revenue streams. Additionally, we plan to continue identifying intellectual property and companies in the biotechnology
arena as potential acquisition candidates.
13
Compassionate
Release Programs
Certain
countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, permit their citizens to have access to investigational medications without being approved
for any applications by their respective “FDA type” agencies, and permit physicians to prescribe drugs they believe are of
possible benefits to the patients. Through these “Compassionate Release Programs”, we have supplied RPI-78M, our drug under
investigation for MS and AMN, to physicians in the United Kingdom. The FDA does not offer this program.
Clinical
Trial Applications
We
have developed Common Technical Documents (CTD) for both RPI-78M and RPI-MN that are used to support any clinical trial application.
The CTD is a complete history of the individual drug, including all of the in-vitro and in-vivo work accomplished to date, as well as
pre-clinical development work on the drug. Having these completed documents allows for expedited due diligence from regulatory bodies
reviewing our applications for trials and approvals. With these documents, we successfully applied for approval to conduct a clinical
investigation in the United Kingdom under the regulation of the Medicines Health and Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is the British equivalent
of the US-FDA.
Current
Research and Development Projects
Neurological
Studies
Pain
Studies
In
an effort to further support Nyloxin Extra Strength, we had planned to complete two human clinical studies aimed at comparing the ability
of Nyloxin Extra Strength to replace prescription pain relievers. We originally estimated that these studies would begin during the second
quarter of 2010; however, these studies have been delayed because of lack of funding. We have no way of knowing at this time, if or when
we will have adequate funding to reinitiate these trials.
AMN
Phase II
We
have been conducting research and development in this area since February 2006 with an original expected completion date of September
2010, which includes a 12-month patient trial period that has already been completed. We have thus far expended approximately $400,000,
because we have completed our AMN Phase II project, there is no further budget for this project.
AMN
Phase III
We
had planned to continue research and development, with the ultimate goal of completing development of our future drug, RPI-78M. Our originally
estimated start and completion dates were July 2010 and December 2011, respectively, which includes a 12-month patient trial period.
We have thus far incurred costs of $5,000. We have an estimated budget of $500,000. We have no way of knowing at this time, if or when
we will have adequate funding to reinitiate these trials.
MS
Phase II (Pediatric MS Phase I/II)
We
are working with our Chief Scientific Officer, Dale Vanderputten, PhD; along with consultants to begin our Phase I/Phase II studies in
pediatric Multiple Sclerosis. Pending adequate financing or revenues, we will continue our research and development, with the ultimate
goal of commencing these trials with RPI-78M under our Orphan Designation. We have thus far incurred costs of $40,000. We have an estimated
budget of $2,000,000. Our goal is to initiate these trials in 2026.
Currently,
our total estimated costs for all of the above projects is approximately $3,000,000.
Since
receiving Orphan designation for the treatment of Pediatric MS, our plans have changed. We are now working with potential sites of care
to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial in Pediatric MS. Our next step is to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to go over the proposed
trial protocols. It is our goal to begin these trials in 2026.
14
Dependence
on one or a Few Major Customers
We
have no customers with respect to our research and development projects since we have not received FDA approval for our drug candidates
and have not licensed any of our technologies.
Marketing
We
currently do not have a marketing program for our drug candidates because none of our products have received FDA approval. Our lack of
financing has hampered our efforts to navigate the regulatory process in a timely fashion; however, if and when we have FDA-approved
drug treatments, we plan to develop a marketing strategy to market our products through pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology
companies, and diagnostic laboratories. Our Chief Executive Officer will market the treatments to licensing and development officers
of those companies and will otherwise direct our marketing program. Additionally, we will attempt to secure consulting agreements with
marketing consultants who will actively market our products to such companies and/or provide our Chief Executive Officer with marketing
guidance.
Potential
Revenue Segments
Our
potential revenue segments are composed of our attempt to generate revenues from license agreements, joint ventures in foreign countries
and drug sales.
To
date, we have not earned any revenues regarding any FDA drug candidate.
Product
Liability
We
maintain product liability insurance for our commercial products. Even so, product liability claims may result in significant legal costs
related to our defense of such actions if damage amounts exceed our product liability insurance coverage. The design, development, and
manufacture of drug products or diagnostic tests involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and corresponding damage to our
brand name reputation, including claims of product failure or harm caused by the drug product.
Sources
and Availability of Raw Materials
We
use the raw material, cobra venom, for the drugs that we study and in the production of all of our over-the-counter products. We currently
have two US suppliers of cobra venom that we use according to product demand. In addition, there are other suppliers in China, Thailand
and India. Our management is responsible for locating cobra venom suppliers on an as-needed basis, which involves obtaining a small test
amount from a supplier for scientific validation of that raw material prior to purchase. Apart from cobra venom, there are no availability
issues with any of the other components, excipients or compounds that we use in our products.
Compliance
with Government Regulations and Need for Government Approval
The
production and marketing of potential drug products as well as research and development activities generally are subject to regulation
by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, vaccines, drugs and certain diagnostic
products are subject to FDA review of safety and efficacy. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and
other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval,
advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in criminal prosecution and fines,
recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or refusal of the government to approve Biological License
Applications (“BLAs”), Product License Applications (“PLAs”), New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) or refusal
to allow a company to enter into supply contracts. The FDA also has the authority to revoke product licenses and establishment licenses
previously granted.
15
In
order to obtain FDA approval to market a new biological or pharmaceutical product, proof of product safety, purity, potency and efficacy,
and reliable manufacturing capability must be submitted. This requires companies to conduct extensive laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical
tests. This testing, as well as preparation and processing of necessary applications, is expensive, time-consuming and often takes several
years to complete. There is no assurance that the FDA will act favorably in making such reviews. Our potential partners, or we, may encounter
significant difficulties or costs in their efforts to obtain FDA approvals, which could delay or preclude from marketing any products
that may be developed. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of marketed products or
place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of such products. Product approvals may be withdrawn
if problems occur following initial marketing, such as, compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. Delays imposed by governmental
marketing approval processes may materially reduce the period during which a company will have the exclusive right to exploit patented
products or technologies. Refusals or delays in the regulatory process in one country may make it more difficult and time consuming to
obtain marketing approvals in other countries.
The
FDA approval process for a new biological or pharmaceutical drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the
results of these studies to the FDA in an Initial New Drug application, which must be approved before human clinical trials may be conducted.
The results of preclinical and clinical studies on biological or pharmaceutical drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA,
PLA or NDA for product approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to a BLA, PLA or NDA, the FDA may require additional testing
or information, or may deny the application. In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each biological or chemical product, an Establishment
License Application (“ELA”) must be filed and the FDA must inspect and license the manufacturing facilities for each product.
Product sales may commence only when both BLA/ PLA/ NDA and ELA are approved. In certain instances in which a treatment for a rare disease
or condition is concerned, the manufacturer may request the FDA to grant the drug product Orphan Drug status for a particular use. “Orphan
Drug” status refers to serious ailments affecting less than 250,000 individuals. In this event, the developer of the drug may request
grants from the government to defray the costs of certain expenses related to the clinical testing of such drug and be entitled to marketing
exclusivity and certain tax credits.
In
order to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace of a medical device, our partners or we will need to receive approval from the FDA
and other equivalent regulatory bodies outside of the United States. This approval will be based upon clinical testing programs at major
medical centers. Data obtained from these institutions will enable us, or our partners, to apply to the FDA for acceptance of its technology
as a “device” through a 510(k) application or exemption process. Once the data have been fully gleaned, it is expected that
this process would take ninety days.
According
to the FDA, a “device” is: “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or
other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is recognized in the official National Formulary, or
the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of
the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on
the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended
purposes.”
The
FDA classifies devices as either Class I/II-exempt, Class II, or Class III.
Class
III: Pre-Marketing Approval, or PMA: A Pre-Marketing Approval or PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required
by FDA. A PMA is an application submitted to FDA to request clearance to market, or to continue marketing of a Class III medical device.
A PMA is usually required for products with which FDA has little previous experience and in such cases where the safety and efficacy
must be fully demonstrated on the product. The level of documentation is more extensive than for a 510(k) application and the review
timeline is usually longer. Under this level of FDA approval, the manufacturing facility will be inspected as well as the clinical sites
where the clinical trials are being or have been conducted. All the appropriate documents have to be compiled and available on demand
by the FDA. The manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA and the product or device is registered with the FDA.
16
Class
II: 510(k). This is one level down from the PMA and it is applied to devices with which the FDA has had previous experience. A 510(k)
is a pre-marketing submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially
equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one
or more similar devices currently on the U.S. market and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. The legally marketed
device to which equivalence is drawn is known as the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when
necessary, performance data to establish that their device is SE to a predicate device. Again, the data in a 510(k) is to show comparability,
that is, substantial equivalency (SE) of a new device to a predicate device. Under this level of approval, the manufacturing facility
is registered with the FDA and the product or device is registered with the FDA. Inspections under this classification are possible.
All the appropriate cGMP and clinical data backing the claims made must be on file and available on demand by the FDA.
Class
I/II Exemption: This is the lowest level of scrutiny. Most Class I devices and a few Class II devices are exempt from the pre-marketing
notification requirements subject to the limitations on exemptions. However, these devices are not exempt from other general controls.
All medical devices must be manufactured under a quality assurance program, be suitable for the intended use, be adequately packaged
and properly labeled, and have establishment registration and device listing forms on file with the FDA. However, as described above,
all the appropriate documentation including cGMP and clinical data supporting the claims being made has to be on hand and available on
demand by the FDA. The data must be available to support all the product claims.
Sales
of biological and pharmaceutical products and medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements
that vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product or a device by a comparable
regulatory authority of a foreign country must generally be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in that country.
Effect
of Compliance with Federal, State, and Local Provisions for the Protection of the Environment
We
have no present or anticipated direct future costs associated with environmental compliance, since we are not and will not be directly
involved in manufacturing drug products as result of our research and development; however, we may be affected in the percentage licensing
fees we receive, since a company may consider the environmental expense as an offset to a determination of the percentage amount we receive.
We produce a drug that has limited waste issues and related costs, but handles environmentally related matters through the FDA’s
Good Manufacturing Practices, the FDA mandated guidelines pertaining to the production of drugs in the United States.
Ability
to Compete
The
biotechnology research and development field is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid change. Our competitors have substantially
greater financial, scientific, and human resources, and as a result greater research and product development capabilities. Our competitors
have competitive advantages with greater potential to develop revenue streams. Our competitors are located in the United States as well
as around the world. We will attempt to compete by establishing strategic partners or alliances with pharmaceutical companies, academic
institutions, biotechnology companies, and clinical diagnostic laboratories, which will enter into joint ventures, emphasizing that the
drugs RPI-MN and RPI-78M possess the following properties:
●
They lack measurable toxicity
but are still capable of attaching to and affecting the target site on the nerve cells. This means that patients cannot overdose.
●
They display no significant
adverse side effects following years of investigations in humans and animals.
●
The products are stable
and resistant to heat, which gives the drug a long shelf life. The drugs’ stability has been determined to be over 4 years
at room temperature.
RPI-78M
can be administered orally; however, we have not yet developed an orally administered RPI-78M. RPI-78M has been routinely delivered by
injection in a manner similar to insulin, but research over the past two years has given rise to administration by mouth. Oral delivery
presents patients with additional “quality of life” benefits by eliminating or decreasing the requirements for routine injections.
Should we receive adequate funding, we plan to develop an orally administered RPI-78M by initiating new trials with an oral version of
that drug.
17
Main
Competitors (Biologics)
Competition
is intense among companies that develop and market products based on advanced cellular and molecular biology. Our competitors, including
Amgen, Sanofi-Aventis, Biogen-Idec, Cephalon, Genetech, Genzyme, Novartis, Regeneron, Roche and Bayer, which have far superior financial,
technological and operational resources. We face significant competition from these and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms
in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Certain specialized biotechnology firms have also entered into cooperative arrangements with
major companies for development and commercialization of products, creating an additional source of competition.
Any
products or technologies that successfully address viral or neurological indications could negatively impact the market potential for
RPI-78M or RPI-MN. These include products that could receive approval for indications similar to those for which RPI-78M or RPI-MN seeks
approval, development of biologic or pharmaceutical treatments that are more effective than existing treatments and the development of
other modalities with reduced toxicity and side effects.
Interferon-based
drugs and their indications represent target markets for us. Sales of interferon-based drugs annually exceed $8 billion and have attracted
the participation of several major drug companies, including Bayer and Roche. Currently, there are eight interferon-based drugs licensed
in Canada and the U.S.; five for the treatment of the milder Relapsing-Remitting form of MS, one for Hepatitis C, one for granulomatous
disease and one for genital warts. These interferons are also used in the treatment of other conditions where treatment options are limited.
The interferons for MS are Betaseron (Bayer), Avonex (Biogen), Plegridy (Biogen), Extavia (Novartis) and Rebif (EMD Serono). Since the
launch of these drugs, the number of patients undergoing treatment has stabilized at current levels, indicating that there is a high
turnover rate of patients in the administration of these individual drugs due to cost and side effects. Biogen developed Avonex in the
early 1990’s and has been shipping the drug since late 1996. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Clinical Efficiency
(NICE) has called for the withdrawal of Betaseron and another unrelated drug, Copaxone (Teva), from the market based on poor cost/effectiveness.
Gilead
Sciences markets Harvoni as a ‘cure’ for Hepatitis C. It combines two drugs: Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and ledipasvir. Harvoni
is taking over the market as Gilead has turned Hepatitis C into a curable illness and has generated over $25B in sales.
Main
Competitors (Venom-Based Drugs)
We
view our main competitors as those who also engage in the development of protein-based neurotoxins as therapeutics. Employing venoms
as therapeutics is not new. A large number of well-known pharmaceutical companies are developing novel therapies derived from
snake venoms and other reptiles. Most of those using snake venoms employ the anticoagulant enzymes usually from viperids (adders and
rattlesnakes) though elapids (cobra family) are also being investigated.
We
have set forth below a summary of venom-based drugs and their potential applications.

primary ingredient and is used to control severe pain in advanced cancer patients and for post-operative pain.
18
Bio-Therapeutics,
Inc.
On
October 3, 2003, we entered into a non-assignable license agreement between Bio-Therapeutics, Inc. (“ Bio-Therapeutics”)
and us, which was then amended to make the license agreement assignable. This agreement was in settlement of a lawsuit that we filed
against Bio-Therapeutics alleging that Bio-Therapeutics owed us $850,000 in connection with a merger agreement between Bio-Therapeutics
and us that was cancelled.
The
2003 license agreement provides that for a non-exclusive license to certain intellectual property of Bio-Therapeutics, which consists
of the following two distinct technology platforms:
●
Alteration of Proteins
and Peptides - These include patented methods for altering the 3-Dimensional structure of certain proteins and peptides. The natural
peptides bind to receptors in the body with toxic effects. This technology allows us to alter the structure of these peptides, preserving
their receptor-binding characteristics, while making them non-toxic and therapeutic. Different receptors have various functions in
many disease states. By the peptides binding to these receptors in a controlled fashion, certain disease symptoms may be treated.
In connection with MS, binding to the acetylcholine receptor on the nerves allows for more efficient nerve conduction. With HIV,
binding to chemokine receptors may prevent the virus from entering and infecting new cells.
●
Non- Exclusive License
for “Buccal Delivery System” (“Buccal”) – An innovative aerosolized drug delivery system that is patent
pending. Many therapeutic agents cannot be effectively delivered by aerosol formulation due to their large size and/or irregular
shapes. Since these therapeutic agents cannot be ingested orally without being degraded by the digestive system, patients have no
alternative but to directly inject these drugs. We have a non-exclusive license to the Buccal patent pending proprietary aerosol
formulation, which greatly enhances the permeability of the mucous membranes found on the roof of the mouth and the back of the throat.
This allows for the easy and efficient systemic delivery into the bloodstream of a much wider variety of proteins and peptides. This
non-exclusive license for “Buccal Delivery System” and patent pending application includes claims that identify the active
mucosal enhancer, its combination with therapeutic agents and the mode of delivery through aerosol. This may allow for the effective
and pain-free delivery of peptide and protein therapeutics for the treatment of HIV and MS.
Patents,
Trademarks, Licenses and Intellectual Property
In
July of 2021, we announced that we had filed a new provisional patent to protect our intellectual
property surrounding our development of nerve agent counter measures. We will continue to prosecute that patent as well as several
other patent applications.
We
have the following patents expiring at various dates indicated below:
ReceptoPharm
Patents
ReceptoPharm
has three issued and several patents pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These patents include:
U.S.
Patent No. 8,034,777, Modified Anticholinergic Neurotoxins as Modulators of the Autoimmune Reaction was granted in October 2011with 7
claims. The patent describes a method of treatment of a human patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis comprising the administration
of a disease-mitigating amount of a composition consisting of detoxified and modified alpha-cobratoxin in a saline solution. This patent
is meant to protect and support our work in the production of drugs for the treatment of auto-immune diseases. This patent expires on November 22, 2025. We have filed new patents in protection of our clinical platform for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases based on manufacturing improvements.
19
U.S.
Patent No. 7,902,152, Use of cobratoxin as an analgesic was granted in March 2011 with 16 claims. The patent describes a composition
of matter for an analgesic and its method of use is disclosed. The method of use is for the treatment of chronic pain, especially to
the treatment of heretofore intractable pain as associated with advanced cancer. The pain associated with neurological conditions, rheumatoid
arthritis, viral infections and lesions is also contemplated. The method includes administering to a host an alpha-neurotoxin that is
characterized by its ability to blocking of the action of acetylcholine at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Currently, this would be
applied to the Company’s current and future drugs for the treatment of pain. This patent will expire on October 13, 2028. We will
file additional patents in protection of our clinical platform for the treatment of pain and inflammation.
U.S.
Patent No. 7,758,894, Modified elapid venoms as stimulators of the immune reaction was granted in July, 2010 with 14 claims. The patent
describes a method of protection from infections by administering a detoxified and neurotropically active modified venom containing alpha-cobratoxin.
Protection includes bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. This patent is meant to protect and support our work in our production
of anti-infective treatments. Currently, this would be applied to RPI-MN and RPI-78. This patent will expire on September 11, 2027. We
will file additional patents in protection of our clinical platform for the treatment of viral infection.
Our
business is dependent upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary

and other contractual arrangements to protect such proprietary information. We will file patent applications for our proprietary methods
and devices for patient treatments. Our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes are subject to significant risks,
including that others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information and techniques, gain access to our proprietary information,
our proprietary information being improperly disclosed, or that we may ineffectively protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets or
other proprietary information.

1A. Risk Factors
You
should carefully consider the risks described below regarding our operations, financial condition, financing, our common stock and other
matters. If any of the following or other material risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results or operations
could be materially adversely affected.
Our
ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing and achieving sufficient sales
levels.
We
incurred net income of $8,176,871 and net losses of $13,095,521 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We incurred
net operating losses of $1,907,404 and $1,988,445 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that these
operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future. We have a significant working capital deficiency, and have not reached a profitable
level of operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued existence is dependent
upon our achieving sufficient sales levels of our Nyloxin and Pet Pain Away products and obtaining adequate financing. Unless we can
begin to generate material revenue, we may not be able to remain in business. We cannot assure you that we will raise enough money or
generate sufficient sales to meet our future working capital needs.
We
have a limited revenue producing history with significant losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future.
We
have yet to establish any history of profitable operations. We incurred net income of $8,176,871 and net losses of $13,095,521 for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We incurred net operating losses of $1,907,404 and $1,988,445 for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, at December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $73,552,118. Our revenues
have been insufficient to sustain our operations and we expect our revenues will be insufficient to sustain our operations for the foreseeable
future. Our potential profitability will require the successful commercialization of our Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products; or a potential
licensing of our therapies under development.
We
will require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it will be unable to continue operations.
At
December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $12,367,244. Our recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have a negative cash flow from operations of approximately
$0.76 million and $1.74 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have insufficient financial resources
to fund our operations.
We
have a history of failed distributors, which has negatively affected our revenues and may continue to do so if we fail to locate a successful
distributor.
Due
to poor performance, we cancelled our distribution agreement with our Cobroxin distributor, XenaCare in April 2011. We plan to re-launch
Cobroxin, but we have not yet ordered product or provided planned sales. To date, we have only limited sales of Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away
through outside distributors. If we fail to improve our own marketing and distribution or fail to find a competent outside distributor
our operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
21
If
we cannot sell a sufficient volume of our products, we will be unable to continue in business.
From
October 2009 until December 31, 2022, our operations centered on the marketing of Cobroxin (our discontinued product), Nyloxin and Nyloxin
Extra Strength. In December of 2014, we launched Pet Pain-Away and began actively marketing the product. In May of 2022, we began producing
products for Avini Health Corporation. Avini Health distributes wellness and nutritional products through their network of independent
distributors in the United States, Canada and the US Virgin Islands. The products that we provide for Avini Health include private label
versions of our Nyloxin products and are sold as: Avini Plus Relief oral spray, Avini Plus Relief topical gel and Avini Plus Relief roll-on.
We also provide the following products: a dietary fiber blend sold as Avini Plus Fiber, a micronized and activated colloidal suspension
of zeolite that is sold as Cell Defender, a mushroom and zeolite blend sold in capsules as ZMUNITY, and a caffeine adaptogenic 2oz energy
shot sold as Avini Plus Energy. During fiscal year 2021, we earned revenues of $97,735, $42,767 of it was from sales of Nyloxin, $42,813
of it was from sales of Pet Pain-Away, and $12,155 of it was from sales of Zeolite. During fiscal year 2022, we earned revenues of $438,274,
$127,306 of it was from sales of Nyloxin and $18,494 of it was from sales of Pet Pain-Away, and $292,474 of it was from sales of Avini
Products. If we cannot achieve sufficient sales levels of our Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products or we are unable to secure financing
our operations will be negatively affected.
We
have a limited history of generating revenues on which to evaluate our potential for future success and to determine if we will be able
to execute our business plan; accordingly, it is difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risk of success or failure of our
business.
You
must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as an early-stage revenue producing
company. These risks include:
●
our ability to effectively
and efficiently market and distribute our products;
●
our ability to obtain market
acceptance of our current products and future products that may be developed by us; and
●
our ability to sell our
products at competitive prices which exceed our per unit costs.
We
may be unable to address these risks and difficulties, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue, operating results and
our ability to continue to operate our business.
Our
growth strategy reflected in our business plan may be unachievable or may not result in profitability.
We
may be unable to implement our growth strategy reflected in our business plan rapidly enough for us to achieve profitability. Our growth
strategy is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance of our Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products and the acceptance
by the public of using these products as pain relievers. We cannot assure you that our products will be purchased in amounts sufficient
to attain profitability.
Among
other things, our efforts to expand our sales of Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away will be adversely affected if:
●
we are unable to attract
sufficient customers to the products we offer in light of the price and other terms required in order for us to attain the level
of profitability that will enable us to continue to pursue our growth strategy;
●
adequate penetration of
new markets at reasonable cost becomes impossible limiting the future demand for our products below the level assumed by our business
plan;
●
we are unable to scale
up manufacturing to meet product demand, which would negatively affect our revenues and brand name recognition;
●
we are unable to meet regulatory
requirements in the intellectual marketplace that would otherwise allow us for wider distribution; and
●
we are unable to meet FDA
regulatory requirements that would potentially expand our product base and potential revenues.
22
If
we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable.
Businesses,
which grow rapidly often, have difficulty managing their growth. If we grow rapidly, we will need to expand our management by recruiting
and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support. We cannot assure you that our management
will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully.
Among
other things, implementation of our growth strategy would be adversely affected if we were not able to attract sufficient customers to
the products and services we offer or plan to offer in light of the price and other terms required in order for us to attain the necessary
profitability.
If
we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, our business could be harmed.
Our
intellectual property, including patents, is our key asset. We currently have 3 active patents and several more in the application process. Competitors may be able to design around our patents for our
Cobroxin, Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products and compete effectively with us. The cost to prosecute infringements of our intellectual
property or the cost to defend our products against patent infringement or other intellectual property litigation by others could be
substantial. We cannot assure you that:
●
pending and future patent
applications will result in issued patents,
●
patents licensed by us
will not be challenged by competitors,
●
our patents, licensed and
other proprietary rights from third parties will not result in costly litigation;
●
pending and future patent
applications will result in issued patents,
●
the patents or our other
intellectual property will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect these technologies or provide us with a competitive
advantage,
●
if we are sued for patent
infringement, whether we will have sufficient funds to defend our patents, and
●
we will be successful in
defending against future patent infringement claims asserted against our products.
Should
any risks pertaining to the foregoing occur, our brand name reputation, results of operation and revenues will be negatively affected.
We
are subject to substantial FDA regulations pertaining to Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away, which may increase our costs or otherwise adversely
affect our operations.
Our
Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products are subject to FDA regulations, including manufacturing and labeling, approval of ingredients, advertising
and other claims made regarding Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away, and product ingredients disclosure. If we fail to comply with current or future
regulations, the FDA could force us to stop selling Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away or require us to incur substantial costs from adopting
measures to maintain FDA compliance.
The
inability to provide scientific proof for product claims may adversely affect our sales.
The
marketing of Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away involves claims that they assist in reducing Stage 2 chronic pain, while Nyloxin Extra Strength
and Nyloxin Military Strength involves claims that they assist in reducing Stage 3 chronic pain. The marketing of Pet Pain-Away involves
claims that they assist in relieving pain in dogs and cats. Under FDA and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) rules, we are
required to have adequate data to support any claims we make concerning Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away. We have scientific data for our Nyloxin
and Pet Pain-Away product claims; however, we cannot be certain that these scientific data will be deemed acceptable to the FDA or FTC.
If the FDA or FTC requests supporting information and we are unable to provide support that it finds acceptable, the FDA or FTC could
force us to stop making the claims in question or restrict us from selling the products.
None
of our ethical drug candidates have received FDA approval.
Our
non-homeopathic or ethical products require a complex and costly FDA regulation process that takes several years for drug approval, if
ever. None of the drug applications we have submitted to the FDA have received FDA approval. If we do not receive FDA approval for our
drug applications, our operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
23
If
we are unable to secure sufficient cobra venom from available suppliers, our operating results will be negatively affected.
We
secure cobra venom on an as-needed basis. If we do not have an available supplier to fill customer orders, there will be distribution
delays and/or our failure to fulfill purchase orders, either of which will negatively affect our brand name reputation and operating
results.
Our
Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products may be unable to compete against our competitors in the pain relief market.
The
pain relief market is highly competitive. We compete with companies that have already achieved product acceptance and brand recognition,
including multi-billion dollar private label manufacturers and more established pharmaceutical and health products companies, or low
cost generic drug manufacturers. Most such companies have far greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing
capabilities than we do. Additionally, if consumers prefer our competitors’ products, or if these products have better safety,
efficacy, or pricing characteristics, our results could be negatively impacted. If we fail to develop and actualize strategies to compete
against our competitors we may fail to compete effectively, which will negatively affect our operations and operating results.
If
we incur costs resulting from product liability claims, our operating results will be negatively affected.
If
we become subject to product liability claims for Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away that exceed our product liability policy limits, we may be
subject to substantial litigation costs or judgments against us, which will negatively impact upon our financial and operating results.
Loss
of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
We
are dependent upon a limited number of our employees: (a) our Chief Executive Officer; (b) our Operations Manager who directs our operations
and (b) our Chief Scientific Officer who conducts our research and development activities. Our success depends on the continued services
of our senior management and key research and development employees as well as our ability to attract additional members to our management
and research and development teams. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel could have a
material adverse effect upon our operations and financial results.
We
may be unable to maintain and expand our business if we are not able to retain, hire and integrate key management and operating personnel.
Our
success depends in large part on the continued services and efforts of key management personnel. Competition for such employees is intense
and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategies may
be lengthy. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute our business objectives. We do not
have any key man life insurance on the lives of any of our executive officers.
Risks
Related to Our Common Stock
Because
the market for our common stock is limited, persons who purchase our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above
the purchase price paid by them.
Our
common stock trades on the OTC-Market, which is not a liquid market. There is currently only a limited public market for our common stock.
We cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. If an active market
for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, the price may decline.
24
Because
we are subject to the “penny stock” rules, brokers cannot generally solicit the purchase of our common stock, which adversely
affects its liquidity and market price.
The
SEC has adopted regulations, which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less
than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock on the OTC has been substantially less than
$5.00 per share and therefore we are currently considered a “penny stock” according to SEC rules. This designation requires
any broker-dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from
the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules limit the ability of broker-dealers
to solicit purchases of our common stock and therefore reduce the liquidity of the public market for our shares.
Because
the majority of our outstanding shares are freely tradable, sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to
drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had 109,150,000 outstanding shares that were subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act
of 1933. In general, Rule 144 provides that any non-affiliates, who have held restricted common stock for at least six-months, are entitled
to sell their restricted stock freely, provided that we stay current in our SEC filings. After one year, a non-affiliate may sell without
any restrictions.
An
affiliate may sell after one year with the following restrictions: (i) we are current in our filings, (ii) certain manner of sale provisions,
(iii) filing of Form 144, and (iv) volume limitations limiting the sale of shares within any three-month period to a number of shares
that does not exceed 1% of the total number of outstanding shares. A person who has ceased to be an affiliate at least three months immediately
preceding the sale and who has owned such shares of common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell the shares under Rule 144
without regard to any of the limitations described above.
An
investment in our common stock may be diluted in the future as a result of the issuance of additional securities or the exercise of options
or warrants.
In
order to raise additional capital to fund our strategic plan, we may issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable into common stock from time to time, which could result in substantial dilution to any person who purchases
our common stock. Because we have a negative net tangible book value, purchasers will suffer substantial dilution. We cannot assure you
that we will be successful in raising funds from the sale of common stock or other equity securities.
Since
we intend to retain any earnings for development of our business for the foreseeable future, you will likely not receive any dividends
for the foreseeable future.
We
have not and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, as we intend to retain any earnings for development and expansion
of our business operations. As a result, you will not receive any dividends on your investment for an indefinite period of time.
Due
to factors beyond our control, our stock price may continue to be volatile.
The
market price of our common stock has been and is expected to be highly volatile. Any of the following factors could affect the market
price of our common stock:
●
our failure to generate
revenue,
●
our failure to achieve
and maintain profitability,
●
short selling activities,
●
the sale of a large amount
of common stock by our shareholders including those who invested prior to commencement of trading,
●
actual or anticipated variations
in our quarterly results of operations,
●
announcements by us or
our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments,
●
the loss of major customers
or product or component suppliers,
●
the loss of significant
business relationships,
●
our failure to meet financial
analysts’ performance expectations,
●
changes in earnings estimates
and recommendations by financial analysts, or
●
changes in market valuations
of similar companies.
25
In
the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has
often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s
time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.

3. Legal Proceedings
Paul
Reid et al. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. et al.
On
August 26, 2016, certain of former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a lawsuit in the 17th Judicial Circuit
in and for Broward County, Florida (Case No. CACE16–015834) against Nutra Pharma and ReceptoPharm to recover $315,000 allegedly
owing to them under a settlement agreement reached in an involuntary bankruptcy action that was brought by the same individuals in 2012
and for payment of unpaid wages/breach of written debt confirms.
On
June 24, 2021, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement of the lawsuit. Nutra Pharma has fully performed under the
settlement and considers the case fully resolved.
CSA
8411, LLC v. Nutra Pharma Corp., Case No. CACE 18-023150
On
October 12, 2018, CSA 8411, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County, Florida
(Case No. CACE 18-023150) to recover $100,000 allegedly owed under an amended promissory note dated April 12, 2017. On November 1, 2018,
the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses to the Complaint. The Company believes that this lawsuit is without merit. Moreover,
the Company believes that it has a number of valid defenses to this claim. Among other things, the owner of CSA 8411, LLC violated the
terms of a Binding Memorandum of Understanding by failing to invest in the Company and fraudulently inducing the Company to enter into
the subject amended promissory note (contrary to the Get Credit Healthy lawsuit discussed above, we are certain that this individual
is the majority owner of CSA 8411, LLC). Opposing counsel reached out to schedule mediation, and mediation was set for June 21, 2019
in Plantation, FL however the mediation was unsuccessful. At December 31, 2022, we owed principal balance of $91,156 and accrued interest
of $62,795 (See Note 6) if the defenses and our new claims are deemed to be of no merit.
Defendant
also filed affirmative claims against the Plaintiff, its owner Dan Oran and several related entities.
On
May 19, 2025, the parties settled the case; fully resolving all existing disputes and conflicts between the parties. We agreed to pay
$35,000 to the plaintiff(s) on or before May 19, 2025 and make nine (9) monthly payments of $10,000 each, beginning on June 19, 2025.
The case was dismissed on May 20, 2025 and all payments to date have been made as agreed.

Securities
and Exchange Commission v. Nutra Pharma Corporation, Erik Deitsch, and Sean Peter McManus
On
September 28, 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) filed a lawsuit (the “SEC Action”)
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Case No. 2:18-cv-05459) against the Company, Mr. Deitsch, and
Mr. McManus. After various motions to dismiss directed to the original Complaint and the First Amended Complaint filed May 29, 2019 were
disposed of in the SEC Action, the SEC filed the Second Amended Complaint against the Company and Messrs. Deitsch and McManus on April
30, 2020 which became the operative pleading seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest
thereon, civil monetary penalties, a permanent officer and director bar, and a permanent penny stock bar for alleged violations between
August 2013 and June 2018 of the registration, broker-dealer registration, periodic reporting, insider reporting, anti-fraud, and anti-manipulation
provisions of the federal securities laws. After approximately four years of litigating the Second Amended Complaint, the Company and
Messrs. Deitsch and McManus agreed to settle the case by entering into consents, without admitting or denying the allegations of the
Second Amended Complaint except as to personal and subject matter jurisdiction, to entry of Final Judgments.
On
March 19, 2024, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in the SEC Action, approved bifurcated settlements
in the form of consent judgments (the “Consent Judgments”) entered by the District Court wherein the Company and Messrs.
Deitsch and McManus, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint except as to personal and subject matter jurisdiction,
resolved all liability issues and certain remedies as to each Defendant and left open other issues relating to remedies regarding the
appropriateness and amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and/or civil penalties to be paid as to all Defendants, and whether
a penny stock bar shall be imposed against Defendant McManus, and if so, the length of any such bar, for later resolution by the District
Court upon motion or further settlement. The Consent Judgments, among other things:
(1)
Permanently enjoin Defendant Nutra Pharma from committing violations of the federal securities laws that the SEC has alleged in this
case, including violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), Sections
10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder;
(2)
Permanently enjoin Defendant Deitsch from committing violations of the federal securities laws that the SEC has alleged in this case,
including violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), and 16(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder; impose a three-year officer-and-director bar on Deitsch,
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(e) and 78u(d)(2); and impose a three-year penny-stock bar on Deitsch, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §
78u(d)(6); and
(3)
Permanently enjoin Defendant McManus from committing violations of the federal securities laws that the SEC has alleged in this case,
including violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
On
May 13, 2024, the remaining remedies regarding disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as to Defendant Deitsch and disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar as to Defendant McManus were resolved by respective consents from each,
without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint except as to jurisdiction and Section XIII of their respective Final Judgments
that restated the permanent injunctive relief, three-year officer-and-director bar on Deitsch, the three-year penny- stock bar on Deitsch
for the alleged violations described above from the Consent Judgments and imposed disgorgement of $44,046, prejudgment interest of $5,013,
and a civil money penalty of $30,000 against Deitsch (a total of $79,060); and that restated the permanent injunctive relief and imposed
two-year penny-stock bar against McManus, and imposed disgorgement of $5,500, prejudgment interest of $626, and a civil money penalty
of $5,500 against McManus (a total of $11,626).
On
August 28, 2024, the remaining remedies regarding disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as to the Company were resolved
by consent by the Company, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint except as to jurisdiction, in its Final Judgment
that restated the permanent injunctive relief against the Company for the alleged violations described above from the Consent Judgment
and imposed disgorgement of $520,940, prejudgment interest of $59,295, and a civil money penalty of $100,000 against Nutra Pharma (a
total of $680,235).

Penny
Stock Considerations
Our
shares of common stock are “penny stocks” as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as equity
securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares are subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on
broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.
Under
the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited
investor” must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written
consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net worth
in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is considered an
accredited investor.
In
addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to:
●
Deliver, prior to any transaction
involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market,
unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;
●
Disclose commission payable
to the broker-dealer and its registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;
●
Send monthly statements
disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account, the account’s value and
information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and
●
Make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement
to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account.
28
Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect
the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity
in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities. In addition,
the liquidity for our securities may be adversely affected, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares
are subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.
Holders
As
of September 3, 2025, based upon records obtained from our transfer agent, there were 396 holders of record of our common stock. Our transfer

December 3, 2003, our Board of Directors approved the Employee/Consultant Stock Compensation Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The
purpose of the 2003 Plan is to further our growth by allowing us to compensate employees and consultants who have provided bona fide
services to us through the award of our common stock. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2003
Plan is 62,500. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had issued a total of 62,375 shares under the 2003 Plan.
2007
Plan
On
June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors approved the 2007 Employee/Consultant Stock Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). The
purpose of the 2007 Plan is to further our growth by allowing us to compensate employees and consultants who have provided bona fide
services to us through the award of our common stock. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2007
Plan is 625,000. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had issued a total of 618,750 shares under the 2007 Plan.
Our
Board of Directors is responsible for the administration of the 2003 and 2007 Plans and has full authority to grant awards under the
Plans. Awards may take the form of stock grants, options or warrants to purchase common stock. The Board of Directors has the authority
to determine: (a) the employees and consultants that will receive awards under the Plan, (b) the number of shares, options or warrants
to be granted to each employee or consultant, (c) the exercise price, term and vesting periods, if any, in connection with an option
grant, and (d) the purchase price and vesting period, if any, in connection with the granting of a warrant to purchase shares of our
common stock.

7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP), we have adopted various accounting policies. Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements.
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including
those related to the ability to continue as going concern, the recoverability of inventory and long-lived assets, the fair value of stock-based
compensation, the fair value of debt, the fair value of derivative liabilities, recognition of loss contingencies and deferred tax valuation
allowances are updated as appropriate, which in most cases is at least quarterly. We base our estimates on historical experience, or
various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about
the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
We
believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include our ability to continue as a going concern, revenue recognition,
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, accounting for long–lived assets and accounting
for stock based compensation.
Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern: Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing,
increase ownership equity, and attain profitable operations. In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered
in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in
which we operate.
Revenue
Recognition: The Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC
606”). Under ASC Topic 606, revenue recognition has a five-step process: a) Determine whether a contract exists; b) Identify the
performance obligations; c) Determine the transaction price; d) Allocate the transaction price; and e) Recognize revenue when (or as)
performance obligations are satisfied.
Our
revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations
are fulfilled upon shipment of products. We record revenues net of promotions and discounts. For certain product sales to a distributor,
we record revenue including a portion of the cash proceeds that is remitted back to the distributor.
31
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We grant credit without collateral to our customers based on our evaluation of a
particular customer’s credit worthiness. Accounts receivable are due 30 days after the issuance of the invoice. In addition, allowances
for doubtful accounts are maintained for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of periodic
credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. Accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts have been
deemed to be unsuccessful. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts, while subsequent
recoveries are netted against the provision for doubtful accounts expense. We generally do not charge interest on accounts receivable.
We use third party payment processors and are required to maintain reserve balances, which are included in accounts receivable.
Our
accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers and
third party payment processors, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends
are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed to arrive at appropriate allowances.
Inventory
Obsolescence: Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market value. We periodically perform an evaluation of inventory
for excess, impairments and obsolete items. At December 31, 2022, our inventory consisted entirely of raw materials and finished goods
that are utilized in the manufacturing of finished goods. These raw materials generally have expiration dates in excess of 10 years.
Commencing on October 1, 2019, we classify inventory as short-term or long-term inventory based on timing of when it is expected to be
consumed.
Long-Lived
Assets: The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed annually and when events or changes in circumstances may suggest impairment
has occurred. If indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable
to the long-lived asset in question is less than its carrying amount. If less, we measure the amount of the impairment based on the amount
that the carrying value of the impaired asset exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal
of the impaired assets.
Derivative
Financial Instrument: Management evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain
features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative
instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
as charges or credits to income. For option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
We
do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.
Convertible
Debt: For convertible debt that does not contain an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation, the conversion feature is evaluated
to determine if the rate of conversion is below market value and should be categorized as a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”).
A BCF related to debt is recorded by the Company as a debt discount and with the offset recorded to equity. The related convertible debt
is recorded net of the discount for the BCF. The discount is amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the debt with
the resulting debt discount being accreted over the term of the note.
The
Fair Value Measurement Option: We have elected the fair value measurement option for convertible debt with embedded derivatives that
require bifurcation, and record the entire hybrid financing instrument at fair value under the guidance of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives
and Hedging (“ASC Topic 815”). The Company reports interest expense, including accrued interest, related to this convertible
debt under the fair value option, within the change in fair value of convertible notes and derivatives in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.
32
Derivative
Accounting for Convertible Debt and Options and Warrants: The Company evaluated the terms and conditions of the convertible debt
under the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The conversion terms of some of the convertible notes are variable based
on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company’s common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is
based on the future price of the Company’s common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debt
is indeterminate. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable could exceed the Company’s authorized share
limit, the equity environment is tainted, and all additional convertible debt and options and warrants are included in the value of the
derivative liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 815-15, Embedded Derivatives, the fair values of the convertible debt, options and warrants
and shares to be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities on the issuance date and revalued at each reporting period.
Share-Based
Compensation: We record share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation. FASB ASC 718 requires that
the cost resulting from all share-based transactions are recorded in the financial statements over the respective service periods. It
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply
a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. FASB ASC 718 also establishes fair
value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment
transactions.
Accomplishments
during 2022 & Subsequent Accomplishments
On
March 17, 2022, we announced that we had completed the process of bringing all of our manufacturing in-house. Previously, we had utilized
contract manufactures to make our products. We announced that expanding our in-house manufacturing capabilities has put Nutra Pharma
in a very good position as far as reduced product costs, higher margins, faster product upgrades and an increased ability to launch new
and innovative products,
On
March 23, 2022, we announced that we had our first agreement to act as a formulator and contract manufacturer for the dietary supplement
company, Avini Health, a related party.
On
March 22, 2024, we announced that we had reached a settlement in the civil lawsuit brought by the SEC.
Results
of Operations
Status
of Operations
In
November 2014, we announced the recertification of our laboratory facility as the first step in re-engaging our drug development activities.
In September, 2015 we received Orphan designation from the FDA for our lead drug candidate, RPI-78M for the treatment of Pediatric Multiple
Sclerosis. This will allow us to shorten the timeline on clinical studies and may allow an eventual Fast Track through the approval
process. We are currently working with our consultants to prepare a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in order to gain approval of a protocol
for a Phase I/II clinical study in Pediatric MS. Our goal is to begin the study in early 2026.
We
estimate that we will require approximately $600,000 to fund our existing operations over the next twelve months. These costs include:
(i) compensation for six (6) full-time employees; (ii) compensation for various consultants who we deem critical to our business; (iii)
general office expenses including rent and utilities; (iv) product liability insurance; and (v) outside legal and accounting services.
These costs reflected in (i) – (v) do not include research and development costs or other costs associated with clinical studies.
We
began generating revenues from the sale of Cobroxin in the fourth quarter of 2009 and from the sale of Nyloxin and Nyloxin Extra Strength
in January of 2011. We began sales of Pet Pain-Away in December 2014. We began selling private label versions of our OTC products in
2021. While sales have increased year over year, they have been limited and inconsistent. Our ability to meet our future operating expenses
is highly dependent on the amount of such future revenues. If future revenues from the sale of out private label products, Nyloxin and
Pet Pain-Away are insufficient to cover our operating expenses we may need to raise additional equity capital, which could result in
substantial dilution to existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient equity capital to fund
our working capital requirements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We may also seek additional loans from our officers and directors;
however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such additional loans.
33
Comparison
of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Sales
for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $438,274 compared to $97,735 for the comparable period in 2021. All of the sales in 2022 and
2021 were related to product sales. The increase in sales is mainly due to an increase in sales of Avini Products. In May 2022, we started
manufacturing products for Avini Health Corporation, a related party.
Cost
of sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $162,842 and $41,268. Cost of sales includes the direct costs associated
with manufacturing, shipping and handling costs. Our gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $275,432 or 62.84%
compared to $56,467 or 57.78% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in our profit margin is primarily due to decrease in
the manufacturing cost. In addition, we had an impairment of prepaid inventory of $26,410 and $48,000 for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, related to undelivered venom and slow-moving inventory.
Selling,
general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $156,048 or 8.09% from $1,928,582 for the year ended December
31, 2021 to $2,084,630 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by higher professional fees, particularly
legal expenses related to the SEC lawsuit. In addition, we incurred bad debt expense of $71,796 and $68,330 from the receivables from
companies owned by the Company’s former CEO for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Other
income of $16,215 for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to the amortization of debt discount from the convertible notes receivables
obtained during 2022. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 is $78,254. $65,274 of it is due to the PPP loan and accrued
interest forgiven by SBA, and $12,980 of it is related to the amortization of debt discount from the convertible notes receivables obtained
during 2021.
Interest
expense, including related party interest expense, increased $295,804 or 59.68%, from $495,679 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
$791,483 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to increase of amortization of loan discount in the year
ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
We
carry certain of our debentures and common stock warrants at fair value. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable
could exceed the Company’s authorized share limit, the equity environment is tainted, and all additional convertible debt, options
and warrants are included in the value of the derivative liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability related
to these hybrid instruments fluctuated, resulting in a gain of $11,023,290 and a loss of $10,096,315, respectively. Interest expense
on these debentures is included in the fair value loss in the consolidated statements of operations.
Loss
on settlement of debts and accrued expenses decreased $332,664 or 68.47%, from the loss of $485,836 for the year ended December 31, 2021
to the loss of $153,172 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease in loss was primarily due to fewer debts being settled through
stock issuance in 2022 compared to 2021.
Stock
issued for loan modification decreased $96,925 or 90.16% from $107,500 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $10,575 for the year ended
December 31, 2022.
As
a result of the foregoing, our net income increased by $21,272,392 or 162.44%, from a loss of $13,095,521 for the year ended December
31, 2021 to an income of $8,176,871 for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Net
cash used in operating activities decreased by 56% to approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately
$1.7 million in 2021. The improvement was largely attributable to favorable changes in working capital, including a $0.8 million increase in accrued expenses
and a $0.2 million increase in deferred revenue, together with smaller inflows from receivables and reduced outflows for prepaid assets
and inventory. However, the reported amounts are significantly affected by non-cash fair value adjustments related to convertible notes
and derivative liabilities. In 2022, a $11.0 million non-cash deduction was recorded in operating cash flows, while in 2021 a $10.1 million
non-cash addition was recorded. These adjustments do not reflect actual cash usage.
34
Net
cash provided by investing activities was approximately $27,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used of approximately
$294,000 in 2021. The change was primarily due to repayments of convertible notes received during 2022.
Net
cash provided by financing activities decreased by 70% to approximately $644,000 in 2022, compared to approximately $2,130,000 in 2021.
The decline was mainly due to an approximately $1.5 million reduction in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
During
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we had negative cash from operations of approximately $0.76 million and $1.74 million. Our
lack of cash, significant losses and working capital deficits and stockholders’ deficits raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have experienced net income of $8,176,871
and a net loss of $13,095,521, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $73,552,118 for the period from our inception to
December 31, 2022. In addition, we had working capital and stockholders’ deficits at December 31, 2022 of $12,367,244 and
$12,377,452, respectively.
Our
ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing, increase ownership equity and attain
profitable operations. In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses
and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had $0 in cash and owed approximately $3.95 million in vendor payables and accrued expenses. We currently do
not have sufficient cash to sustain our operations for the next 12 months and will require additional financing or an increase in sales
in order to execute our operating plan and continue as a going concern. Our plan is to continue to increase sales of our products and
attempt to secure adequate funding to bridge the commercialization of our Nyloxin and Pet Pain-Away products. We cannot predict whether
additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form and we may be unable to obtain the necessary additional capital
on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that these financing sources do not materialize, or that we are unsuccessful
in increasing our revenues and profits, we may be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay our obligations as they
become due or continue as a going concern, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.
Historically,
we have relied upon loans from our former Chief Executive Officer Rik J Deitsch, to fund costs associated with our operations. These
loans are unsecured, accrue interest at a rate of 4.0% per annum and are due on demand. At December 31, 2022, the net balance due to
Rik Deitsch, and the companies majority owned and/or controlled by him (collectively referred to as “Due to Officer”) in
the aggregate is $112,046, which net balance is unsecured and accruing interest at 4%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, in the
aggregate, we repaid $267,500 and were advanced $103,385 on this balance. Additionally, accrued interest on the outstanding balance was
$4,639 and is included in the due to officer account. The Company had fully reserved receivables from companies owned by the Company’s
former CEO. The reserve was $71,796 as of December 31, 2022. The bad debt expense of $71,796 was recorded for the year ended December
31, 2022.
During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we raised net cash proceeds of $760,000 and $464,852 through the issuance of convertible notes and
promissory notes, respectively. Current operations are being funded through a combination of product sales, loans from our CEO and convertible
notes.
35
Impact
of COVID-19 on our Operations
The
ramifications of the outbreak of the novel strain of COVID-19, reported to have started in December 2019 and spread globally, are
filled with uncertainty and changing quickly. Our operations have continued during the COVID-19 pandemic and we have not had
significant disruption. Beginning in June 2020, the Company experienced a delay in retail rollout as a downstream implication of the
slowing economy. We also closed our Coral Springs office in effort to save money. During May 2020, we received approval from SBA to
fund our request for a PPP loan for $64,895. We used the proceeds primarily for payroll costs. The entire loan was forgiven in
November 2021 and recorded as other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During April and June 2020, we obtained the
loan in the amount of $150,000 from SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance program. We used the proceeds primarily
for rent, payroll, utilities, accounting and legal expenses.
The
COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, operations, or financial results for the periods presented.
While the pandemic created significant global disruption in prior years, the Company’s operations have returned to normal, and
management does not currently expect COVID-19 to have a material adverse effect on future results. However, the Company will continue
to monitor any public health developments and related economic conditions that could affect its business.
Uncertainties
and Trends
Our
operations and possible revenues are dependent now and in the future upon the following factors:
●
Whether we successfully
develop and commercialize products from our research and development activities.
●
If we fail to compete effectively
in the intensely competitive biotechnology area, our operations and market position will be negatively impacted.
●
If we fail to successfully
execute our planned partnering and out-licensing of products or technologies, our future performance will be adversely affected.
●
The recent economic downturn
and related credit and financial market crisis may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing, conduct our operations and realize
opportunities to successfully bring our technologies to market.
●
Biotechnology industry
related litigation is substantial and may continue to rise, leading to greater costs and unpredictable litigation.
●
If we fail to comply with
extensive legal/regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we will face increased costs, and possibly penalties and
business losses.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated with us under whom we
have:
●
An obligation under a guarantee
contract.
●
A retained or contingent
interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk
support to such entity for such assets.
●
Any obligation, including
a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument.
●
Any obligation, including
a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by us and material to us where
such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and
development services with us.
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material,
other than those which may be disclosed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes.

9A. Controls and Procedures
Section
1.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
As
of December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed
in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
at a reasonable assurance level, as of December 31, 2022. In light of this, we performed additional post-closing procedures and analyses
in order to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. As a result of these procedures, we believe our Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations

system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
with the company have been detected.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, our management concluded that
its material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting include matters pertaining to: (a) lack of qualified accounting
personnel; (b) inadequate segregation of duties, and (c) the need to enhance the supervision, monitoring and reviewing of financial statement
preparation processes due to lack of qualified accounting personnel.
37
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, or the
persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation
of our financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-2013) in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance
for Smaller Public Companies. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer,
our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and concluded
that it is ineffective because of the material weaknesses. These identified material weaknesses included (i) an insufficient accounting
staff; (ii) inadequate segregation of duties; (iii) limited checks and balances in processing cash and other transactions; and (iv) lack
of independent directors and an independent audit committee.
To
remedy these weaknesses, when financially able, we plan to supplement our accounting staff with additional experienced financial professionals,
redefining and realigning responsibilities and by defining additional controls, reporting processes and procedures to address the accounting
requirements and disclosures, and engage independent directors and a qualified independent audit committee.
In
addition, until we locate and engage appropriate accounting personnel, we will engage third party consultants to assist in accounting
for complex transactions and disclosures.
The
material weaknesses discussed above will not be considered remediated until the necessary personnel have been engaged and the applicable
remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating
effectively.
Management’s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d)
of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item
9B. Other Information
In
conjunction with Item 9A above (Evaluation of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting) and following our management’s assessment
and conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 is ineffective, because of the material weaknesses
described above, we are seeking a new Chief Financial Officer pending funding.

Debt
owed to a Director
During

months to a year from the date of the loan along with interest calculated at 10% for the first month plus 12% after 30 days from funding.
We are in default regarding this loan. The loan is under personal guarantee by Mr. Deitsch. We repaid principal balance in full as of

12,500,000 shares of common stock to satisfy the $10,000 accrued interest. The shares were valued at accrued payable amount due to the
fact that it was a related party transaction. During the first and second quarter of 2022, we repaid $15,000 of accrued interest. At

Director
Independence
Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC-Markets; that trading medium does not have director independence requirements. Under Item 407(a) of
Regulation S-K, we have adopted the definition of independence used by the NYSE American, which may be found in the guide at (s) 121(A)
(2) (2007). This definition states that our Board of Directors must affirmatively determine whether any of our directors have a relationship
that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities of a director. Based on this definitional
standard, our Board of Directors has determined that none of our Directors are independent.
Item
14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services
Auditor
Change in 2024
In
2024, the Company appointed Astra Audit and Advisory (“Astra”) as its independent auditor following a routine evaluation
of audit services. The change reflects the Company’s focus on maintaining rigorous financial oversight. The Company expresses its
gratitude to Rotenberg Meril Solomon Bertiger & Guttilla, P.C. (“RotenbergMeril”), which served as auditor for the 2021
annual audit and 2022 interim reviews for their contributions.
Audit
Fees
The
fees billed to us by our former auditor, RotenbergMeril, for the audits of our 2021 and 2020 annual consolidated financial statements
and the reviews of our 2022 interim condensed consolidated financial statements was $115,000 and $100,000, respectively.
The
fees to be billed by our current auditor, Astra, for the audits of our 2022 and 2021 annual consolidated financial statements is $50,000
and $50,000, respectively.
Audit-Related
Fees
Audit-related
fees represent review of registration statements or services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings
or engagements for those fiscal years, and the aggregate fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to
the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. No such fees were billed by
Astra and RotenbergMeril for 2022 or 2021, respectively.
Tax
Fees
No
such fees were billed by Astra and RotenbergMeril for 2022 or 2021, respectively.
All
Other Fees
No
such fees were billed by Astra and RotenbergMeril for 2022 or 2021, respectively.
As

Company has an audit committee which reviewed all fees to the principal accountant. The percentage of hours expended on the principal
accountant’s engagement to audit our financial statements for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed
by persons other than the principal accountant’s full-time, permanent employees was 0%.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Nutra Pharma Corporation
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nutra Pharma Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Substantial
Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1, the Company has experienced significant recurring losses from operations, had a significant amount of indebtedness in default,
and had significant working capital and stockholders’ deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts
or disclosures to which they relate.
Derivative
Accounting for Convertible Debentures and Warrants
As
described in Notes 1, 2 and 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company adheres to ASC 815 for derivatives
and hedging. The conversion terms of some of the convertible notes and number of shares of common stock to be issued are variable based
on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company’s common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the debt is indeterminate. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable could exceed the Company’s
authorized share limit, the equity environment is tainted, and all additional convertible debt and warrants are included in the value
of the derivative liabilities. The Company estimates and records the fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
We
identified the Company’s application of the accounting for convertible notes, warrant features and derivative liabilities as a
critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of
subjectivity in the Company’s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the
Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters.
The
primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following:
●Reviewed
agreements for all relevant terms.
●Tested
management’s identification and treatment of agreement terms.
●Recalculated
management’s fair value based on the terms in the agreements, including evaluating
and testing the inputs used in those calculations.
●Recalculated
the total derivative liability.
●Assessed
the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting
policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of the amortization of
the debt discount.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.

2011. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Liquidity
and Going Concern
Our
Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplate the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced recurring, significant losses from operations, and have an accumulated
deficit of $73,552,118 at December 31, 2022. In addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness in default, a working capital
deficit of $12,367,244 and a stockholders’ deficit of $12,377,452 at December 31, 2022.
There
is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern which is contingent upon our ability to secure additional financing,
increase ownership equity and attain profitable operations. In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered
in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered in established markets and the competitive environment in
which we operate.
We
do not have sufficient cash to sustain our operations for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report and will require
additional financing in order to execute our operating plan and continue as a going concern. Since our sales are not currently adequate
to fund our operations, we continue to rely principally on debt and equity funding; however, proceeds from such funding have not been
sufficient to execute our business plan. Our plan is to attempt to secure adequate funding until sales of our pain products are adequate
to fund our operations. We cannot predict whether additional financing will be available, and/or whether any such funding will be in
the form of equity, debt, or another form. In the event that these financing sources do not materialize, or if we are unsuccessful in
increasing our revenues and profits, we will be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay our obligations as they become
due and continue as a going concern.
The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
F-7
Impact
of COVID-19 on our Operations
The
ramifications of the outbreak of the novel strain of COVID-19, reported to have started in December 2019 and spread globally, are filled
with uncertainty and changing quickly. Our operations have continued during the COVID-19 pandemic and we have not had significant disruption.
Beginning in June 2020, the Company experienced a delay in retail rollout as a downstream implication of the slowing economy. We also
closed our Coral Springs office in an effort to save money. During May 2020, we received approval from the Small Business Administration
(“SBA”) to fund our request for a PPP loan for $64,895. We used the proceeds primarily for payroll costs. The entire loan
was forgiven in November 2021 and recorded as other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During April and June 2020, we
obtained the loan in the amount of $150,000 from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance program. We used the proceeds
primarily for rent, payroll, utilities, accounting and legal expenses (See Note 6).
The
COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on the Company’s business, operations, or financial results for the periods presented.
While the pandemic created significant global disruption in prior years, the Company’s operations have returned to normal, and
management does not currently expect COVID-19 to have a material adverse effect on future results. However, the Company will continue
to monitor any public health developments and related economic conditions that could affect its business.
Use
of Estimates
The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Significant estimates include our ability to continue as going concern, the recoverability
of inventories and long-lived assets, the recoverability of amounts due from officer, the valuation of stock-based compensation and certain
debt and derivative liabilities, recognition of loss contingencies and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, which would be recorded in the period in which
they become known.
Revenue
from Contracts with Customers
The
Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
Under ASC Topic 606, revenue recognition has a five-step process: a) Determine whether a contract exists; b) Identify the performance
obligations; c) Determine the transaction price; d) Allocate the transaction price; and e) Recognize revenue when (or as) performance
obligations are satisfied.
Our
revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations
are fulfilled upon shipment of products. We record revenues net of promotions and discounts. For certain product sales to a distributor,
we record revenue including a portion of the cash proceeds that is remitted back to the distributor.
Deferred
revenue represents cash received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Such amounts are recognized as revenue
when the related performance obligations are satisfied, which typically occurs upon shipment of the products.
F-8
Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Costs
We
account for shipping and handling as fulfilment activities and record amounts billed to customers as revenue and the related shipping
and handling costs as cost of sales.
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We
grant credit without collateral to our customers based on our evaluation of a particular customer’s credit worthiness. Accounts
receivable are due 30 days after the issuance of the invoice. In addition, allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for potential
credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial
condition. Accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts have been deemed to be unsuccessful. Accounts written off as
uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts, while subsequent recoveries are netted against the provision for
doubtful accounts expense. We generally do not charge interest on accounts receivable. We use third party payment processors and are
required to maintain reserve balances, which are included in accounts receivable.
Accounts
receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers and third party
payment processors, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. No allowance for doubtful accounts is deemed to be required
at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Inventories
Inventories,
which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, consist of packaging materials, finished products, and raw venom
that is utilized to make the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). The raw unprocessed venom has an indefinite life for use. Commencing
on October 1, 2019, we classify inventory as short-term or long-term inventory based on timing of when it is expected to be utilized
in production. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand. If necessary, it records a net realizable value adjustment
for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimates of product demand and production requirements. Write-downs are charged
to cost of goods sold. We performed an evaluation of our inventory and related accounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and increased
the reserve on supplier advances for future venom purchases included in prepaid expenses and other current assets by $26,410 and $48,000,
respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total valuation allowance for prepaid venom was $320,572 and $294,162, respectively.
Financial
Instruments
Our
financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, loans payable, due to officers and derivative
financial instruments. Other than certain warrant and convertible instruments (derivative financial instruments) and liabilities to related
parties (for which it was impracticable to estimate fair value due to uncertainty as to when they will be satisfied and a lack of similar
type transactions in the marketplace), we believe the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because
they are short term in nature or payable on demand. Our derivative financial instruments are carried at a measured fair value.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Balances
in various cash accounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts. We do not
hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, there was one customer that
accounted for 67% of the total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was one customer that accounted for 21% of the total
revenues. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 100% of the accounts receivable balances are reserves due from one payment processor and
two payment processors, respectively.
F-9
Operating
Lease Right-of-Use Asset and Liability
The
Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as
amended (“ASC Topic 842”). This standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset
and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months and classify as either operating or finance
leases.
In
accordance with ASC Topic 842, at the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease
based on the unique facts and circumstances present and the classification of the lease including whether the contract involves the use
of a distinct identified asset, whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset, and
whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the consolidated
balance sheets as ROU assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company has elected not to recognize
on the consolidated balance sheets leases with terms of one year or less under the practical expedient in paragraph ASC 842-20-25-2.
Lease
liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.
The implicit rate within our operating leases are generally not determinable and, therefore, the Company uses the incremental borrowing
rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The determination of the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate requires judgment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease using our estimated borrowing
rate.
Derivative
Financial Instruments
Management
evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded
at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.
For option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities
are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative
instrument could be required within 12 months of the consolidated balance sheet date.
We
do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.
Convertible
Debt
Effective
January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.
Under this guidance, the previous accounting models requiring separation of certain conversion features, including the beneficial conversion
feature (“BCF”) model, were eliminated. As a result, convertible instruments issued after adoption are generally accounted
for as a single liability (or equity instrument, as applicable), unless the conversion feature requires separate accounting as a derivative
under ASC 815.
Prior
to adoption, for convertible debt that did not contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, the Company evaluated whether the
rate of conversion was below market value and, if so, recorded a BCF as a debt discount with the offset to equity. The related convertible
debt was presented net of the discount, and the discount was amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the debt.
The
Fair Value Measurement Option
We
have elected the fair value measurement option for convertible debt with embedded derivatives that require bifurcation, and record the
entire hybrid financing instrument at fair value under the guidance of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC Topic
815”). The Company reports interest expense, including accrued interest, related to this convertible debt under the fair value
option, within the change in fair value of convertible notes and derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Derivative
Accounting for Convertible Debt and Options and Warrants
The
Company evaluated the terms and conditions of the convertible debt under the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The
conversion terms of some of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company’s
common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company’s common stock. The
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debt is indeterminate. Due to the fact that the number of shares of
common stock issuable could exceed the Company’s authorized share limit, the equity environment is tainted, and all additional
convertible debt and options and warrants are included in the value of the derivative liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 815-15, Embedded
Derivatives, the fair values of the convertible debt, options and warrants and shares to be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities
on the issuance date and revalued at each reporting period.
F-10
Debt Modifications and Extinguishments
The Company evaluates amendments,
restatements, or other changes to its debt agreements in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments.
Under this guidance, we determine whether the revised terms represent a modification of the existing debt or an extinguishment of the
old debt and issuance of new debt. If the changes are not deemed substantial, the transaction is accounted for as a modification and any
associated fees or costs are amortized over the remaining term of the modified debt. If the changes are determined to be substantial,
the original debt is considered extinguished, the new debt is recorded at fair value, and any resulting difference between the carrying
amount of the old debt and the fair value of the new debt is recognized in earnings as a gain or loss on extinguishment.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major improvements and additions are added to property and equipment, while replacements,
maintenance and repairs which do not extend the useful lives are expensed. Assets disposed of or retired are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of 3 – 7 years.
Long-Lived
Assets
The
carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed annually and when events or changes in circumstances may suggest impairment has occurred..
If indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
the long-lived asset in question is less than its carrying amount. If less, we measure the amount of the impairment based on the amount
that the carrying value of the impaired asset exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal
of the impaired assets.
Income
Taxes
We
compute income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC Topic 740”). Under ASC Topic 740, deferred
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
also arise from net operating losses carried forward. Also, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that included the enactment date. Temporary differences between financial and tax reporting arise primarily from the use
of different methods to record bad debts and /or sales returns, inventory reserves, and accrued expense.
On
an annual basis, we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns to determine if they are
more than likely to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the respective position. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we do not believe
we have a need to record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or provisions for interest or penalties related to such positions.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation (“ASC Topic 718”).
ASC Topic 718, which requires that the cost resulting from all share-based transactions be recorded in the consolidated financial statements
over the respective service periods. It establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements
and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
The statement also establishes fair value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services
from non-employees in share-based payment transactions.
F-11
Net
Loss Per Share
Net
income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic income (loss) per share
is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income
(loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock
equivalents outstanding. During periods in which we incur losses, common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect
would be anti-dilutive or have no effect on earnings per share. Any common shares issued as of a result of the exercise of conversion
options and warrants would come from newly issued common shares from our remaining authorized shares.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
Pronouncements
As
of January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own
Equity, which simplifies and clarifies certain calculation and presentation matters related to convertible and equity and debt instruments.
Specifically, ASU-2020-06 removes requirements to separately account for conversion features as a derivative under ASC Topic 815 and
removing the requirement to account for beneficial conversion features on such instruments. Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 also
provides clearer guidance surrounding disclosure of such instruments and provides specific guidance for how such instruments are to be
incorporated in the calculation of Diluted EPS. The adoption did not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
As
of January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
(Subtopic 470-50), Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modification or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written
Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”), which will clarify and reduce diversity in practice. Specifically, the new standard includes
a recognition model comprising four categories of transactions and corresponding accounting treatment for each category. The category
that would apply to a modification or an exchange of an equity-classified warrant would depend on the substance of the modification transaction
(e.g. a financing transaction to raise equity versus one to raise debt). This recognition model is premised on the idea that the accounting
for the transaction should not differ from what it would have been had the issuer of the warrants paid cash instead of modifying the
warrants. The adoption did not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
F-12
Not
Yet Effective Pronouncements
The
Company has evaluated the impact of the following recently issued accounting standards, which have not yet been adopted as of December
31, 2022:
As
of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016- 13”),
which significantly changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that
are not measured at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss model with an expected credit loss
model that requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on most financial assets and certain other instruments. Under
ASU 2016-13 credit impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses, rather than as a direct write-down of the amortized cost
basis of a financial asset. The impairment allowance is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets
to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. Once the new pronouncement is adopted by the Company, the
allowance for credit losses must be adjusted for management’s current estimate at each reporting date. The new guidance provides
no threshold for recognition of impairment allowance. Therefore, entities must also measure expected credit losses on assets that have
a low risk of loss. The Company is required to estimate an allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables that are either
current or not yet due under ASU 2016-13. The adoption did not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
As
of January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2023-03, Codification Improvements to Segment Reporting (Topic 280) (“ASU
2023-03”), which provides clarifications and improvements to the existing segment reporting requirements, including updates related
to the aggregation criteria, reconciliation of segment measures to consolidated financial statements, and disclosure requirements. The
ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The adoption did not have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
2.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Certain
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are measured in accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 820-10-05, Fair Value Measurements. FASB ASC Topic 820-10-05 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands the disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities as
well as for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated
financial statements.
The
statement requires fair value measurement be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level
1:
Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2:
Quoted
prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability; and
Level
3:
Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e. supported
by little or no market activity).

The
loss (gain) related to the revaluation of our warrant liability is included in “Change in fair value of convertible notes and

We
valued our warrants using a Dilution-Adjusted Black-Scholes Model. Assumptions used include (1) 0.19% to 4.76% risk-free rate, (2) warrant
life is the remaining contractual life of the warrants, (3) expected volatility of 276% to 580% (4) zero expected dividends (5) exercise
price set forth in the agreements (6) common stock price of the underlying share on the valuation date, and (7) number of shares to be
issued if the instrument is converted.
We
valued derivative liabilities using the number of potential convertible shares for warrants in equity and convertible notes with a fixed
conversion price that are recorded at amortized cost times the closing stock price of our restricted common stock at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. These derivative liabilities are recorded due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable
could exceed the Company’s authorized share limit and the equity environment is tainted, and therefore all convertible debt and
options and warrants should be accounted for as liabilities.
The
following table summarizes assumptions and the significant terms of the convertible notes for which the entire hybrid instrument is recorded

During October 2021, we issued 12,500,000 shares of common stock to satisfy the $10,000 accrued interest. The shares were valued
at accrued payable amount due to the fact that it was a related party transaction. During the first and second quarter of 2022, we

shares pre reverse stock split) of our free trading stock held in escrow by their attorney and receive cash settlements for a total
amount of $450,000 (the initial $350,000 plus total default penalties of $100,000). LPR sold the note to Southridge Partners, LLP

recorded as a debt discount. 92,100,000 of the warrants expired in August 2022. 36,300,000 of the warrants expired in October 2022. Due

issued with debt are treated as derivative liabilities requiring fair value adjustment at each reporting date. The warrants were valued

using the Black-Scholes method and recorded as a debt discount. The debt discounts associated with the warrants and OID for $50,000 and
$7,500, respectively, have been amortized over the life of the notes. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable
could exceed the Company’s authorized share limit, the warrants issued with debt are treated as derivative liabilities requiring

to repay $16,693 in cash by October 2022. However, we failed to meet this repayment obligation. As a result, the new convertible note
amounts to a total of $200,312 (including $166,926, $16,693, and an original issuance discount of $16,693) with a fixed conversion price
of $0.002 per share, due February 2023. In connection with restatement in August 2022, 10,000,000 shares of common stock with fair value
of $10,000 (See Note 7) were issued due to the late payments. $10,000 was recorded as stock based loan modification cost in other expense.
The
total discount amortization on all notes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $308,200. At December 31, 2021, the principal balance
of the notes, net of discount of $283,430 is $3,751,760.
During
2022, we issued convertible promissory notes to unrelated third parties totaling $874,000 with original issuance discounts of $114,000.
The noteholders have the right to convert the notes into shares of common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.0005 to $0.0008
per share, and the notes are due one year from their respective execution and funding dates..
During
January and May 2022, in connection with the issuance of one of the above mentioned convertible notes of $115,000 with original issuance
discount of $15,000 due in one year, the Company granted the 164,285,714 warrants at an exercise price of $0.002 per share that expire
one year from the date of issuance. The warrants are valued using the Black-Scholes method and recorded as a debt discount. No warrants
have been exercised. The debt discounts associated with the warrants and OID for $100,000 and $15,000, respectively, are amortized over
the life of the notes. Due to the fact that the number of shares of common stock issuable could exceed the Company’s authorized
share limit, the warrants issued with debt are treated as derivative liabilities requiring fair value adjustment at each reporting date.
The warrants were valued at their fair value of $6,072 using the Black-Scholes method on December 31, 2022 (See Note 8).
During
2022, the convertible promissory notes for a total of $339,825 were amended to add additional original issuance discount for a total
of $50,974 scheduled to expire in July 2023.

of common stocks in satisfaction of $108,500 of the Notes with a fair value of $222,500 (See Note 7). The settlement resulted in a loss
on settlement of debt for $114,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In
August 2022, we settled a convertible note payable of $17,250 issued in July 2021 for a total repayment of $18,000, resulting in a recorded
loss of $750. Of this repayment, $12,000 was repaid in 2022, and the remaining $6,000 was repaid in January and February 2023. As part
of the settlement, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $500 (see Note 7), which was recorded as a stock-based
loan modification cost within other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.
At
the date of this report, $4,616,866 of the above-mentioned convertible notes payable are in default and in negotiation of settlement.

At
December 31, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of all warrants outstanding and expected to vest was $0. The intrinsic value of warrant
share is the difference between the fair value of our restricted common stock and the exercise price of such warrant share to the extent
it is “in-the-money”. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value that would have been received by the holders of in-the-money
warrants had they exercised their warrants on the last trading day of the year and sold the underlying shares at the closing stock price
on such day. The intrinsic value calculation is based on $0.0001, the closing stock price of our restricted common stock on December
31, 2022. There were no in-the-money warrants at December 31, 2022.

Litigation
Paul
Reid et al. v. Nutra Pharma Corp. et al.
On
August 26, 2016, certain of former ReceptoPharm employees and a former ReceptoPharm consultant filed a lawsuit in the 17th Judicial Circuit
in and for Broward County, Florida (Case No. CACE16–015834) against Nutra Pharma and ReceptoPharm to recover $315,000 allegedly
owing to them under a settlement agreement reached in an involuntary bankruptcy action that was brought by the same individuals in 2012
and for payment of unpaid wages/breach of written debt confirms.
On
June 24, 2021, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement of the lawsuit. Nutra Pharma has fully performed under the
settlement and considers the case fully resolved.
CSA
8411, LLC v. Nutra Pharma Corp., Case No. CACE 18-023150
On
October 12, 2018, CSA 8411, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the 17th Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County,
Florida (Case No. CACE 18-023150) to recover $100,000
allegedly owed under an amended promissory note dated April 12, 2017. On November 1, 2018, the Company filed its Answer and
Affirmative Defenses to the Complaint. The Company believes that this lawsuit is without merit. Moreover, the Company believes that
it has a number of valid defenses to this claim. Among other things, the owner of CSA 8411, LLC violated the terms of a Binding
Memorandum of Understanding by failing to invest in the Company and fraudulently inducing the Company to enter into the subject
amended promissory note (contrary to the Get Credit Healthy lawsuit discussed above, we are certain that this individual is the
majority owner of CSA 8411, LLC). Opposing counsel reached out to schedule mediation, and mediation was set for June 21, 2019 in
Plantation, FL however the mediation was unsuccessful. At December 31, 2022, we owed principal balance of $91,156
and accrued interest of $62,795
(See Note 6) if the defenses and our new claims are deemed to be of no merit. Defendant also filed affirmative claims against the
Plaintiff, its owner Dan Oran and several related entities. On May 19, 2025, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with
the counterparty, under which the total obligation was resolved for $125,000.
The settlement terms include an initial payment of $35,000
made on May 19, 2025, followed by nine monthly payments of $10,000
each. The agreement also provides that, in the event of a payment default not cured within five business days of written notice, the
counterparty may seek entry of a consent judgment against the Company in the amount of $400,000,
reduced by any amounts already paid under the settlement. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owed principal balance of $91,156, and
accrued interest of $62,795 and $51,856, respectively. The total liability recorded prior to the settlement on May 19, 2025 was
$178,526,
consisting of $91,156
in principal and $87,370
in accrued interest. The settlement of $125,000
will result in a gain on settlement of $53,526,
which will be recognized upon full satisfaction of the payment terms (see Note 15).
F-29
Securities
and Exchange Commission v. Nutra Pharma Corporation, Erik Deitsch, and Sean Peter McManus
On
September 28, 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Case No. 2:18-cv-05459) against the Company, Mr. Deitsch, and Mr. McManus. The lawsuit
alleges that, from July 2013 through June 2018, the Company and the other defendants’ defrauded investors by making materially
false and misleading statements about the Company and violated anti-fraud and other securities laws.
The
violations alleged against the Company by the SEC include: (a) raising over $920,000 in at least two private placement offerings for
which the Company failed to file required registration statements with the SEC; (b) issuing a series of materially false or misleading
press releases; (c) making false statements in at least one Form 10-Q; and (d) failing to make required public filings with the SEC to
disclose the Company’s issuance of millions of shares of stock. The lawsuit makes additional allegations against Mr. McManus and
Mr. Deitsch, including that Mr. McManus acted as a broker without SEC registration and defrauded at least one investor by making false
statements about the Company, that Mr. Deitsch engaged in manipulative trades of the Company’s stock by offering to pay more for
shares he was purchasing than the amount the seller was willing to take, and that Mr. Deitsch failed to make required public filings
with the SEC. The lawsuit seeks both injunctive and monetary relief.
On
May 29, 2019 (following each of the defendants filing motions to dismiss), the SEC filed a First Amended Complaint which generally alleged
the same conduct as its original Complaint, but accounted for certain guidance provided by the United States Supreme Court in a case
that had been recently decided. Each of the defendants then moved to dismiss the SEC’s First Amended Complaint. On March 31, 2020,
the Court entered an Order granting in part and denying in part the various motions to dismiss. Following that Order, the SEC filed a
Second Amended Complaint (the operative pleading) and the defendants have filed their answers which generally deny liability. At this
time, discovery is closed and the SEC has indicated an intent to file a summary judgment motion regarding certain non-fraud claims asserted
in its Second Amended Complaint. The defendants have opposed the SEC’s request to file such motion(s). The Court conducted a hearing
on February 23, 2021 and set an initial briefing schedule for the SEC’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment wherein the Plaintiffs’
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment was due on April 5, 2021, the Defendants’ Consolidated (i.e., collectively, Nutra Pharma Corporation,
Erik “Rik” Deitsch, and Sean McManus) Response Brief to the SEC’s Motion was due May 3, 2021, and the Plaintiffs’
Reply Brief was due on May 19, 2021. On March 23, 2021, the Plaintiff filed a Motion for Extension of Time to file the Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment. On April 9, 2021, the Plaintiff filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Defendants’ filed a Memorandum of
Law in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion on May 7, 2021, and Plaintiff filed its Reply brief on May 21, 2021.
In
July 2024, a final judgment was issued, ordering the defendant to pay $520,940 in disgorgement, $59,295 in prejudgment interest, and
a $100,000 civil penalty. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued a total legal settlement amount of $680,235 (See Note 10).
