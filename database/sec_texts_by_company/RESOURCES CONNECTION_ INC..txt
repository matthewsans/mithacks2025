As a next-generation human capital partner for our clients, we are a trusted partner to the C suite, specializing in navigating complex business challenges typically precipitated by business and technology transformation, strategic transactions, or regulatory compliance. Our engagements are designed to leverage a combination of bench and agile talent that are highly experienced to deliver practical solutions and more impactful results that power our clients’, employees’ and partners’ success. We attract top-caliber professionals with in-demand skill sets who seek a workplace environment characterized by choice and control, collaboration and human connection. The trends in today’s marketplace favor flexibility and agility as businesses confront transformation pressures and skilled labor shortages even in the face of protracted economic uncertainty. Our client engagement and talent delivery model offer speed and agility, strongly positioning us to help clients transform their businesses and workforce approach.We serve more than 1,600 clients around the world with approximately 3,100 professionals collectively engaged from 41 physical practice offices and multiple virtual offices. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, we are proud to have served 88% of the Fortune 100 as of May 2025.Business SegmentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company reorganized the Company’s business by forming multiple discrete operational business units. To align the new operating model and financial reporting, the Company made management organizational changes and implemented new reporting modules and processes to provide discrete information to manage the business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company completed its assessment of the Company's operating segments and identified the following newly defined operating segments:•On-Demand Talent – this segment provides businesses with a go-to source for bringing in experts to fill resource gaps when they need them. •Consulting – this segment drives transformation across people, processes and technology across domain areas including accounting and finance, technology and digital, risk and compliance and supply chain transformation. •Europe & Asia Pacific – is a geographically defined segment that offers both on-demand and consulting services to clients throughout Europe and Asia Pacific.•Outsourced Services – operating under the Countsy by RGPTM brand, this segment offers finance, accounting and human resources (“HR”) services provided to startups, spinouts and scale-up enterprises, utilizing a technology platform and fractional team.•Sitrick – a crisis communications and public relations firm that provides corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.Each of these segments reports through a separate segment manager to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who are collectively designated as the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for segment reporting purposes. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of On-Demand Talent, Consulting, Europe & Asia Pacific, and Outsourced Services. Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed under the “All Other” segment. Each of these segments represents a reporting unit for the purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment.Recent AcquisitionsOn July 1, 2024 the Company completed the acquisition of Reference Point LLC (“Reference Point”), a U.S.-based advisory firm that focuses on strategy, risk, regulatory, and technology transformation services for financial institutions. From the date of acquisition, Reference Point has been reported within the Consulting Services operating 3Table of Contentssegment. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Industry Background and TrendsChanging Market for Project- or Initiative-Based Professional ServicesOur services respond to what we believe is a permanent marketplace shift: namely, organizations are increasingly choosing to address their workforce needs in more flexible ways. Permanent professional personnel positions are being reduced as organizations engage agile talent for project initiatives and transformation work.Organizations use a mix of alternative resources to execute initiatives and projects. Some companies rely solely on their own employees who may lack the requisite time, experience or skills for specific projects. Other companies may outsource entire projects to consulting firms, which provides them access to the expertise of the firm but often entails significant cost, insufficient management control of the project and a lack of ultimate ownership at project completion. As a more cost-efficient alternative, companies sometimes use temporary employees from traditional and internet-based staffing firms, although these employees may be less experienced or less qualified than employees from professional services firms. Finally, companies can supplement their internal resources with employees from agile consulting or other traditional professional services firms, like RGP. The use of project consultants as a viable alternative to traditional accounting, consulting, and law firms allows companies to:•Strategically access specialized skills and expertise for projects of set durations;•Engage the very best expert talent across regions and geographies;•Be nimble and mobilize quickly;•Blend independent and fresh points of view;•Effectively supplement internal resources;•Increase labor flexibility; and•Reduce overall hiring, training and termination costs.Supply of Project ConsultantsBased on our review of labor market dynamics and discussions with our consultants, we believe that there is sustained demand among professionals seeking to work on an agile basis due to a desire for:•More flexible hours and work arrangements, coupled with an evolving professional culture that offers competitive wages and benefits;•The ability to learn and contribute to different environments and collaborate with diverse team members;•Challenging engagements that advance their careers, develop their skills and add to their portfolio of experience;•A work environment that provides a diversity of, and more control over, client engagements; and•Alternative employment opportunities throughout the world.The traditional employment options available to professionals may fulfill some, but not all, of an individual’s career objectives. A professional working for a Big Four firm or a consulting firm may receive challenging assignments and training; however, he or she may encounter a career path with less choice and less flexible hours, extensive travel demands and limited control over work engagements. On the other hand, a professional who works as an independent contractor assumes the ongoing burden of sourcing assignments and significant administrative obligations, including potential tax and legal issues.RGP’s SolutionWe believe RGP is ideally positioned to capitalize on the confluence of the industry shifts described above. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that RGP provides the agility companies desire in today’s highly competitive and quickly evolving business environment. Our solution offers the following elements:•A relationship-oriented and collaborative approach to client service; •Flexible engagement models to meet clients where they need us, whether it's embedded expertise, strategic and execution oriented consulting or fully outsourced solutions;•A dedicated talent acquisition and management team adept at developing, managing and deploying a project-based workforce;4Table of Contents•Deep functional and/or technical experts who can assess clients’ project needs and customize solutions to meet those needs;•Highly qualified and pedigreed consultants with the requisite expertise, experience and points of view;•Competitive rates on an hourly basis as well as on a project basis; and•Significant client control of their projects with effective knowledge transfer and change management.RGP’s Strategic PrioritiesOur Business StrategyWe are dedicated to serving our clients with flexible engagement models and highly qualified and experienced talent in support of projects and initiatives in a broad array of functional areas, including:Transactions•Integration and divestitures•Bankruptcy/restructuring•Going public readiness and support•Financial process optimization•System implementationRegulations•Accounting regulations•Internal audit and compliance•Data privacy and security•Healthcare compliance•Regulatory complianceTransformations•Finance transformation•Digital transformation•Supply chain management•Cloud migration•Data design and analyticsOur objective is to build and maintain RGP’s reputation as the premier provider of project execution services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. We have developed the following business strategies to achieve our objectives: •Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced consultants. We believe our highly qualified, experienced consultants provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to continue to attract and retain high-caliber consultants who are committed to serving clients and solving their problems. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified professionals by providing interesting work assignments within a blue-chip client base, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing professional development and learning opportunities, as well as membership in an exclusive community of like-minded professionals, while offering flexible work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements.•Maintain our distinctive culture. Our corporate culture is a core pillar of our business strategy, and we believe it has been a significant component of our success. See “Human Capital Management” below for further discussions about our culture.•Deepen our consulting capabilities and establish consultative relationships with clients. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the professional services experience of our management and consultants enables us to understand the needs of our clients and deliver an integrated, relationship-based approach to meeting those needs. Client relationships and needs are addressed from a client-centric, not geographic, perspective. Our team regularly meets with our existing and prospective clients to understand their business issues and identify tailored solutions to meet the clients’ objectives, whether it’s resourcing with highly skilled experts or strategic consulting with RGP's specific points of view. We believe that by establishing relationships with our clients to solve their professional service needs, we are more likely to identify new opportunities to serve them. The strength and depth of our client relationships is demonstrated by the 78% retention rate of our top 100 clients over the last five fiscal years.•Build the RGP brand. We have historically built our brand through the consistent and reliable delivery of high-quality, value-added services to our clients as well as a significant referral network of approximately 2,400 consultants and approximately 700 management and administrative employees as of May 31, 2025. In recent years, we have invested in global, regional and local marketing and brand building and activation efforts that reinforce our brand. In fiscal 2025, we launched a brand refresh to clarify what we do, who we serve, when to engage us, and the impact we deliver, reflected across our updated digital properties to enhance understanding of our full capabilities and client value. 5Table of ContentsWe expect to continue to engage in these efforts in the upcoming fiscal year. We rely on trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand.Our Growth StrategySince inception, our growth has been primarily organic with certain strategic acquisitions along the way that augmented our geographic presence or solution offerings. We believe we have significant opportunity for continued organic growth in our core business as well as through strategic and highly targeted acquisitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include:•Increase penetration of existing client base. A principal component of our strategy is to secure additional work from the clients that we serve. Based on discussions with our clients, we believe that the amount of revenue that we currently generate from many of our clients represents a relatively small percentage of the total amount that they spend on professional services. We believe our clients may increase that spend as businesses adopt a more agile workforce strategy. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by deepening our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients’ professional services budgets. We maintain our Strategic Client Account program to serve a number of our largest clients with dedicated global account teams. We have and will continue to expand the Strategic Client Account program by taking a more client-centric and borderless approach to serving these clients. In addition to serving our largest clients with a differentiated focus, we also segment our clients by industry verticals. We believe this focus enhances our opportunity to develop in-depth knowledge of these clients’ needs and the ability to increase the scope and size of projects with those clients. The Strategic Client Account and Industry Vertical programs have been key drivers for our revenue and business development.•Grow our client base. We continue to focus on attracting new clients. We strive to develop new client relationships primarily by leveraging the significant contact networks of our management and consultants, through referrals from existing clients and through a dedicated business development team targeting specific clients. We believe we can continue to attract new clients by building our brand identity and reputation, supplemented by our global, regional and local marketing efforts. We anticipate our growth efforts will continue to focus on identifying strategic target accounts especially in the large and middle-market client segments and within certain focus industries, such as healthcare, technology and financial services.•Optimize service offerings with a focus on digital capabilities. We continue to evolve and optimize our portfolio of professional service offerings, and when appropriate, consider entry into new professional service offerings. Since our founding, we have diversified our professional service offerings from a primary focus on accounting and finance to other areas in which our clients have significant needs such as digital transformation, finance transformation, accounting regulations, internal audit and compliance, healthcare compliance, integration and divestitures, and supply chain management. We continuously identify project opportunities we can market at a broader level with our talent, tools and methodologies and commercialize into solution offerings. When evaluating new or existing solution offerings to invest in, we consider (among other things) profitability, cross-marketing opportunities, buyer personas, competition, growth potential and cultural fit. We offer valuable digital consulting services, particularly related to experience and automation. With our acquisition of Reference Point in July 2024, we expanded our tailored technology and data modernization offerings to our many financial services industry clients. Customer experience and employee and workspace experience continue to be growing themes in the marketplace and within our client portfolio. The need for automation and self-service has also been an increasing trend. We will continue to focus on expanding our technology and digital consulting capabilities and their geographic reach to drive growth in the business by capturing the market demand and opportunities.•Further our strategic brand marketing. RGP has always focused our business on project execution, which is a distinct space on the continuum between strategy consulting and interim deployment. Our business model of utilizing experienced talent to flatten the traditional consulting delivery pyramid is highly sought after in today’s market. Most clients are capable of formulating business strategy organically or with the help of a strategy firm; where they need help is in the ownership of executing the strategy. Our co-delivery ethos is focused around partnering with clients on project execution. Our brand marketing will continue to emphasize and accentuate our unique qualifications in this arena. We believe clear articulation and successful marketing of our distinctive market position is key to attracting and retaining both clients and talent, enabling us to drive continued growth.•Engage in strategic acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is to engage in targeted M&A efforts that are designed to complement our core service offerings and enhance our consulting capabilities that are in line with market demands and trends. Our acquisition of CloudGo, now integrated into our Consulting practice, expanded our ServiceNow capabilities as well as our ServiceNow footprint in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, as noted above, our acquisition of 6Table of ContentsReference Point in July 2024 has allowed us to expand our offerings to clients within the financial services industry. We will continue to seek acquisition opportunities to augment and expand the breadth and depth of our digital and other core capabilities.Our Service Offerings•Project Consulting Services. We partner with our people and clients to deliver value and impact, bringing our depth of experience and “sleeves up” approach to project execution. While many companies find their internal employees lack the time, experience, or skills for project execution, we seek out talent who can bring fresh ideas to drive any project to a successful conclusion.•On-demand Talent Services. Tapping into our agile talent pool, we mobilize the right resources to build delivery teams for our consulting offerings and directly support client talent needs in today’s rapidly changing business environment. Our workforce strategy provides flexible, collaborative resources to meet our clients’ needs.•Outsourced Services. We offer outsourced finance, accounting and HR services to startups, spinouts and scale-up enterprises, utilizing a technology platform and fractional team.•Crisis Communication Services. Through Sitrick, we provide corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.Human Capital ManagementOur internal employees and consultants represent our greatest asset and operate together to provide the highest quality of service to our clients. As of May 31, 2025, we had 3,055 employees, including 687 management and administrative employees and 2,368 consultants. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.Our Culture and Values Our culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our senior management team, the majority of whom are Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 alumni, has created a culture that combines the commitment to quality and the client service focus of a Big Four firm with the entrepreneurial energy of an innovative, high-growth company. Our culture is built upon our shared, core values of Loyalty, Integrity, Focus, Enthusiasm, Accountability and Talent, and we believe this is a key reason for our success. We strive to earn the trust of our clients, employees, and the communities we serve by operating a legal, ethical and trustworthy manner. Our corporate policies and structure allow our employees, executives and board to lead with integrity and transparency. Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth the standards our employees and board members must adhere to at all times in the execution of their duties. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as honest and candid conduct, conflicts of interest, protecting confidential information, anti-corruption, compliance with laws, rules and regulations, fair dealing, equal opportunities and non-harassment, maintaining a safe workplace, and the reporting of violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline).Inclusion and Belonging At RGP, we aim to create a workplace where people feel valued and supported. We believe our success comes from building teams with unique skills, perspectives and backgrounds. We offer three employee resource groups (“ERGs”) open to all employees — Women in Leadership, Multicultural, and Interfaith ERGs—which are voluntary, employee-led groups that are dedicated to fostering an inclusive work environment.In fiscal 2025, we continued our charitable giving matching fund with company matching contributions upwards of $100,000. Since fiscal 2021, we have supported approximately 250 unique charitable organizations with over $500,000 in contributions. We also encourage our employees' community involvement through our Spirit of Volunteerism Initiative, which supports causes important to employees. We are committed to fostering growth, community and connections both inside and outside of RGP.7Table of ContentsEmployee Wellbeing and ResilienceEmployee safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance to us. Our Global Business Continuity Team continued to improve our disaster preparedness plans and implement strategies to manage the health and security of our employees, business continuity, client confidence, and excellent customer service. To promote employee wellbeing and collaboration, we continued to offer a hybrid work policy, where employees are invited to work collaboratively with colleagues in the office and are permitted to work remotely as desired. Our goal is to help every human in our workforce maintain a positive, productive and connected work experience. We provide productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely. During fiscal 2025, we also enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees’ physical and mental wellbeing, including the launch of a wellness app, YuLife, to all U.S. employees. This gamified app is designed to promote healthy habits by rewarding employees for walking, cycling, meditating and brain training. We continue to support physical, mental and financial wellness through communications and webinars. Our You Matter recognition program is ongoing and allows employees to share gratitude and kudos for colleagues. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program for U.S. employees and a Global Workforce Support Program for our international employees. Both programs provide resources to support personal and family health and wellbeing. Building Strong Leaders and Talent ManagementStrong “human leadership” is critical to fostering employee engagement and positioning employees to perform at their best. We offer “Leadership U” to foster leadership development, peer mentorship opportunities and to support the building and maintenance of high-performing teams. In fiscal 2025, we saw a continued and strengthened desire from employees seeking authentic, empathetic and adaptive behaviors from their leaders. For these reasons, we invest in the ongoing professional development of our employees and leaders. We designed and delivered curated programs such as “Leadership U” to onboard and acclimate employees to the business and promote personal, professional and leadership growth.Successful talent development starts with hiring the right people. We seek to recruit and hire candidates that demonstrate skills and competencies that align with our core values and that have an aptitude to further develop and expand those capabilities. After onboarding, our Life + Learning team remains committed to providing employees with training and development opportunities to allow our employees to progress in their careers. We offer newly hired employees the opportunity to participate in our “RGP U” program to accelerate and support their integration into our organization. This program gives our new hires a connected cohort to drive a sense of belonging early in their career at RGP and offers their leaders a more efficient use of individual coaching time with new employees. We also offer “RGP U Consultant” to ensure strong connectivity and supported success in a consultant’s first year with RGP. Additionally, we offer a Sales Effectiveness curriculum focused on deepening sales and client service acumen and effectiveness.In addition, we continued to invest in the professional development and growth of our employees as we focused on employee experience, effectiveness, upskilling and reskilling in a changing work environment. This support was focused and delivered to all employees with emphasis in the areas of leadership development, on-boarding, functional/technical learning and digital fluency. We continued to actively engage with our internal leaders by integrating wellness and leadership development topics into our quarterly senior leadership meetings. We also conducted intentional leader listening forums and mentorship programs to help guide our leaders during fiscal 2025.Compensation and BenefitsWe provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to attract and reward our employees. In addition to salaries or hourly rates, our eligible employees, including our consultants, are offered participation in a comprehensive benefits program (based on location) including: paid time off and holidays, group medical and dental programs, a basic term life insurance program, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) retirement plan, contributions to statutory retirement programs, the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”), which enables employees to purchase shares of our stock at a discount, and an employee assistance program. In addition, eligible management and administrative employees may participate in annual cash incentive programs or receive stock-based awards. We also allow eligible consultants in the U.S. to maintain continuation of benefits for 90 days following the completion of a consulting project. We utilize a Pay for Success Total Rewards Philosophy that promotes consistent and transparent practices for rewarding and incentivizing our employees and the alignment of pay results with the Company’s success. The Total Rewards Philosophy is comprised of three main components: (i) base pay, designed to reflect an individual’s value, 8Table of Contentsknowledge and skills that contribute to the organization through an individual’s day-to-day job performance; (ii) short-term incentives, awarded to employees based on results delivered during the applicable fiscal year and determined by quantitative metrics, qualitative contributions, individual goals, and demonstration of company values; and (iii) long-term incentives, granted to recognize and retain employees who have strategic influence on the long-term success of the Company. As a listening organization, we continue to communicate with our people to understand what components of Total Rewards are priority for them and leverage that feedback, along with quantitative benchmarking data and affordability considerations, to continually evolve our Total Rewards offerings in a way that positions us to attract and retain top talent.During fiscal 2025, we also continued our “You Matter” digital global employee recognition and appreciation program. You Matter includes service awards to acknowledge key milestones, including employment anniversaries and hours of service. This program provides all employees with the ability to both give and receive recognition, contributing to our culture of gratitude and excellence.ClientsWe provide our services and solutions to a diverse client base in a broad range of industries. In fiscal 2025, we served more than 1,600 clients in 32 countries. Our revenues are not concentrated with any particular client. No single client accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the 2025, 2024 or 2023 fiscal years. In fiscal 2025, our 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 22% of our revenue. OperationsWe generally provide our professional services to clients at a local level, with the oversight of our revenue team (including market or account leaders) and engagement leaders when delivering solutions on consulting projects. The revenue team in each market, in collaboration with subject matter experts in the consulting business, are responsible for new client acquisition, expanding client relationships, ensuring client satisfaction throughout engagements, coordinating services for clients on a national and international level and maintaining client relationships post-engagement. Market or account revenue leadership and their teams identify, develop and close new and existing client opportunities, often working in a coordinated effort with other markets on multi-national/multi-location proposals. While the majority of our client relationships are driven at a local market level, our Strategic Client Accounts, which are comprised of approximately 20 accounts, are led by account leaders responsible for relationships across markets and who are specifically tasked with growing our global relationships in these key accounts.Market or account level leadership works closely with our talent management team to identify, hire and cultivate a relationship with seasoned professionals that fit our clients' needs. Our consultant recruiting efforts are regionally and nationally based, depending upon the skill sets required and our clients' preference for local talent. Recognizing the complexity of multinational client relationships, we've also utilized a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both local relationships and global delivery. We utilize a Borderless Talent model and seek to provide borderless solutions, anytime, anywhere, bringing the best talent to meet our clients’ business needs, based on expected outcome, not zip code. In addition, in order to meet our clients where they need us and expand our reach for in-demand talent and skill sets, we operate global delivery centers in India and the Philippines. We often blend our delivery teams with talent across the globe to maximize the impact we deliver to our clients.Our consulting business is organized by practice areas. Each practice has team members with deep subject matter expertise who focus on a combination of sales pursuit (in collaboration with the revenue team), project delivery/oversight and solution development.We believe our ability to deliver professional services successfully to clients is dependent on our leaders in the field working together as a collegial and collaborative team. To build a sense of team spirit and increase camaraderie among our leaders, we have a program for field personnel that awards annual incentives based on specific agreed-upon goals focused on the performance of the individual and performance of the Company. We also share across the Company and with new team members the best and most effective practices of our highest achieving offices, consulting practices and accounts. New leadership also spends time in other markets or otherwise partners with experienced personnel to understand how best to serve current clients, expand our presence with prospects and identify and recruit highly qualified consultants, among many other important skills. This allows the veteran leadership to share their success stories, foster our culture with new team members and review specific client and consultant development programs. We believe these team-based practices enable us to better serve clients who prefer a centrally organized service approach.9Table of ContentsWe provide administrative, marketing, finance, HR, information technology (“IT”), legal and real estate support throughout our U.S. offices. We also have a business support operations center in our Utrecht, Netherlands office to provide centralized finance, HR, IT, payroll and legal support to our European offices. These centralized functions minimize the administrative burdens on our front office market leaders and enable operational efficiency and scalability throughout the enterprise. Business DevelopmentOur business development initiatives are comprised of:•local and global initiatives focused on existing clients and target companies;•national and international targeting efforts focused on multinational companies;•brand marketing activities; and•national and local advertising and direct mail programs.Our business development efforts are driven by the networking and sales efforts of our management, with our worldwide Salesforce software platform providing a common database of opportunities and clients and enhancing our local and global business development efforts. While local senior management focus on market-related activities, they are also part of the regional, national and international sales efforts, especially when the client is part of a multinational entity. In certain markets, sales efforts are also enhanced by management professionals focused solely on business development efforts on a market and national basis based on firm-wide and industry-focused initiatives. These business development professionals, in partnership with the vice-presidents and client service teams, are responsible for initiating and fostering relationships with the senior management and decision makers of our targeted client companies. We believe our national marketing efforts have effectively generated incremental revenues from existing clients and developed new client relationships. Our brand marketing initiatives help bolster RGP’s reputation in the markets we serve. Our brand is reinforced by our professionally designed website, print, and online advertising, direct marketing, seminars, thought leadership whitepapers, initiative-oriented brochures, social media and public relations efforts. We believe our branding initiatives, coupled with our high-quality client service, help to differentiate us from our competitors and to establish RGP as a credible and reputable global professional services firm.CompetitionWe operate in an extremely competitive, highly fragmented market and compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. The competition for talent and clients is likely to increase in the future due to workforce gaps caused by the tightening labor market, a changing market for project- or initiative-based services and the relatively few barriers to entry. Our principal competitors include:•business operations and financial consulting firms;•local, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms;•independent contractors;•traditional and internet-based staffing firms; and•the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients.We compete for clients based on the quality of professionals we bring to our clients, the knowledge base they possess, our ability to mobilize the right talent quickly, the effectiveness of our solutions, the scope and price of services, and the geographic reach of services. We believe our attractive value proposition, consisting of our diversified and relevant solution offerings, highly qualified consultants, relationship-oriented approach, delivery model (agile, bench and offshore) and professional culture, enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace. Regulatory EnvironmentOur operations are subject to regulations by federal, state, local and professional governing bodies and laws and regulations in various foreign countries, including, but not limited to: (a) licensing and registration requirements and (b) regulation of the employer/employee relationship, such as worker classification regulations, wage and hour regulations, tax withholding and reporting, immigration/H-1B visa regulations, social security and other retirement, anti-discrimination, and employee benefits and workers’ compensation regulations. Our operations could be impacted by legislative changes by these bodies, particularly with respect to provisions relating to payroll and benefits, tax and accounting, employment, worker classification and data privacy which could materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings and/or competitive position. Due to the complex regulatory environment that we operate in, we remain focused on compliance with 10Table of Contentsgovernmental and professional organizations’ regulations. For more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on our financial results, refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors.”Available InformationOur principal executive offices are located at 15950 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 330, Dallas, Texas 75248.

The order of the risks is not an indication of their relative weight or importance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us but do represent those risks and uncertainties we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely impact and impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and all or part of the investment in our common stock might be lost. When determining whether to buy our common stock, other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, should also be reviewed.Risks Related to the Business EnvironmentAn economic downturn or deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our global operations and financial condition. We are exposed to the risk of an economic downturn or deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation, or decreases in consumer spending power or confidence, which could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Recent inflationary conditions and high interest rates, geopolitical conflicts as further discussed below and increasing diplomatic and trade friction, including as a result of new and increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. against China, Mexico, Canada and other countries, pandemics or public health crises, have caused disruptions in the U.S. and global economy, and uncertainty regarding general economic conditions within some regions and countries in which we operate, including concerns about a potential U.S. and/or global recession. These disruptions and uncertainties have led, and may continue to lead, to reluctance on the part of some companies to spend on discretionary projects. Deterioration of or prolonged uncertainty related to the global economy or tightening credit markets, including as a result of tariffs or other import restrictions, could cause some of our clients, particularly those reliant on global supply chains, to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties and could further reduce the demand for our services and adversely affect our business in the future. The military incursion by Russia into Ukraine and conflict and unrest in the Middle East could continue to create global economic and market uncertainty in a manner that could adversely affect our operations. Wars divert international trade and capital flows, disrupt global supply chains, delay companies’ investment and hiring and erode consumer confidence, and periods of elevated geopolitical risks have historically been associated with negative effects on global economic activity. Although none of our operations are in Russia, Ukraine or areas of the Middle East experiencing conflict, the continuation or further escalation of geopolitical tensions, or future instances of political unrest in other geographies, could impact other markets where we do business, including Europe and Asia Pacific, or cause negative global economic effects which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Economic deterioration at one or more of our clients may also affect our allowance for credit losses and collectability of accounts receivable. Our estimate of losses resulting from our clients’ failure to make required payments for services rendered has historically been within our expectations and the provisions established. While our overall receivable collections have not been severely impacted by the softening economy or other geopolitical events, we cannot guarantee we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and cash flows and additional allowances for anticipated losses may be required. These additional allowances could materially affect our future financial results.In addition, we are required periodically, and at least annually, to assess the recoverability of certain assets, including deferred tax assets, long-lived assets and goodwill. Downturns in the U.S. and international economies have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, long-lived assets and goodwill. Although the additional tax valuation allowances and the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill are non-cash expenses, they could materially affect our future financial results and financial condition.The market for professional services is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We operate in a competitive, fragmented market, and we compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Our principal competitors include: consulting firms; local, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms; independent contractors; traditional and internet-12Table of Contentsbased staffing firms; and the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients. The competition is likely to increase in the future due to the expected growth of the market and the relatively few barriers to entry. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or future competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, greater revenues and greater name recognition, which may afford them an advantage in attracting and retaining clients and consultants and in offering pricing concessions. Some of our competitors in certain markets do not provide medical insurance or other benefits to their consultants, thereby allowing them to potentially charge lower rates to clients. In addition, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in companies’ needs and developments in the professional services industry.Bank failures or other events affecting financial institutions could adversely affect our and our clients’ liquidity and financial performance.We regularly maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks, which exceed the FDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not insured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or other similar agencies. The failure of a bank, or events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to disruptions in access to our bank deposits or otherwise adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.Our clients, including those of our clients that are banks, may be similarly adversely affected by any bank failure or other event affecting financial institutions. Any resulting adverse effects to our clients’ liquidity or financial performance could reduce the demand for our services or affect our allowance for credit losses and collectability of accounts receivable. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and cash flows and additional allowances for anticipated losses may be required. These additional allowances could materially affect our future financial results.In addition, instability, liquidity constraints or other distress in the financial markets, including the effects of bank failures, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our current or any future credit agreement from honoring their commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.Risks Related to Human Capital ResourcesWe must provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants, and the loss of a significant number of our consultants, or an inability to attract and retain new consultants, could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our business involves the delivery of professional services, and our success depends on our ability to provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to satisfy their needs. At various times, including as a result of shifts by businesses to adopt more workforce agility in response to temporary gaps caused when labor markets tighten, such professionals can be in great demand, particularly in certain geographic areas or if they have specific skill sets. Our ability to attract and retain consultants with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:•provide our consultants with either full-time or flexible-time employment;•obtain the type of challenging and high-quality projects that our consultants seek;•provide competitive compensation and benefits; and•provide our consultants with flexibility as to hours worked and assignment of client engagements.There can be no assurance we will be successful in accomplishing any of these factors and, even if we are, we cannot assure we will be successful in attracting and retaining the number of highly qualified and experienced consultants necessary to maintain and grow our business.13Table of ContentsOur business could suffer if we lose the services of one or more key members of our senior management or key sales professionals.Our future success depends upon the continued employment of our senior management team, including key client development individuals (“CDIs”). The unforeseen departure of one or more key members of our senior management team or CDIs could significantly disrupt our operations if we are unable to successfully manage the transition. The replacement of members of senior management or CDIs can involve significant time and expense and create uncertainties that could delay, prevent the achievement of, or make it more difficult for us to pursue and execute on our business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.Further, due to legal restrictions prohibiting non-compete agreements in certain jurisdictions, we generally do not have non-compete agreements with our employees, including our senior management team or CDIs, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time and obtain employment with a competitor. Our ability to retain the services of members of our senior management, CDIs and other key employees could be impacted by a number of factors, including competitors’ hiring practices or the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If members of our senior management, CDIs or other key employees leave us for any reason, they could pursue other employment opportunities with our competitors or otherwise compete against us. If we are unable to retain the services of these key personnel or attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Significant increases in wages or payroll-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.To ensure that we attract and retain the requisite talent, it is necessary that we pay our consultants competitive wages. We are also required to pay a number of federal, state and local payroll-related costs for our employees and consultants, including providing certain benefits such as medical insurance, paid time off and sick leave, and paying unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance premiums and claims, and FICA and Medicare taxes. These costs could be increased by wage inflation and changes to local laws and regulations. Costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel. We may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and InitiativesOur business depends upon our ability to secure new projects from clients and renew expired contracts, and we could be adversely affected if we fail to do so.We generally do not have long-term agreements with our clients for the provision of services and our clients may terminate engagements with us at any time. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to secure new projects from clients or to renew expired or expiring contracts with clients. For example, our business is likely to be materially adversely affected if we are unable to secure new client projects because of improvements in our competitors’ service offerings, because of our customers’ use of technology or AI instead of external experts, because of a change in government regulatory requirements, because of an economic downturn decreasing the demand for outsourced professional services, or for other reasons. New impediments to our ability to secure projects from clients may develop over time, such as the increasing use by large clients of in-house procurement groups that manage their relationship with service providers.As technology continues to evolve, more tasks currently performed by people have been and may continue to be replaced by automation, robotics, machine learning, AI and other technological advances outside of our control. These technological changes may (i) reduce demand for our services, (ii) enable the development of competitive products or services, or (iii) enable our current customers to reduce or bypass the use of our services, particularly in lower-skill job categories. Additionally, rapid changes in AI and generative AI which involves the use of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to create content, generate ideas, or simulate human-like behaviors and block chain-based technology are increasing the competitiveness landscape. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these changes and there can be no assurance that we can integrate other technologies we use with AI or that material additional monetary and time expenditures will not be required. In addition, demand for our services could be further reduced by advanced technologies being deployed by our competitors.
If we are not able to replace the revenue from our expired client contracts, either through follow-on contracts or new contracts for those requirements or for other requirements, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected. On the expiration of a contract, we typically seek a new contract or subcontractor role relating to that client to replace the revenue generated by the expired contract. There can be no assurance that those expiring contracts we are 14Table of Contentsservicing will continue after their expiration, that the client will re-procure those requirements, that any such re-procurement will not be restricted in a way that would eliminate us from the competition, or that we will be successful in any such re-procurements or in obtaining subcontractor roles. Any factor that diminishes client relationships and/or our professional reputation could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for new engagements and qualified consultants. To the extent our client relationships and/or professional reputation deteriorate, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain a suitable pay/bill ratio.Our consultant cost structure is primarily variable in nature, and our profitability depends to a large extent on the level of pay/bill ratio achieved. Our failure to maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services or to pay an adequate and competitive rate to our consultants in order to maintain a suitable pay/bill ratio could compress our gross margin and adversely impact our profitability.The pay rates of our consultants are affected by a number of factors, including:•the skill sets and qualifications our consultants possess;•the competition for talent; and•current labor market and economic conditions.The billing rates of our consultants are affected by a number of factors, including:•our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services;•the market demand for the services we provide;•introduction of new services by us or our competitors;•our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors; and•current economic conditions.If we are unable to achieve a desirable pay/bill ratio, our financial results could materially suffer. In addition, a limited number of clients are requesting certain engagements be a fixed fee rather than our traditional hourly time and materials approach, thus shifting a portion of the burden of financial risk and monitoring to us.We derive significant revenue and profits from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process, which can impose substantial costs on us, and we will lose revenue and profits if we fail to compete effectively.Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including the:•substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals;•need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope; and•opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we may have otherwise pursued.To the extent we engage in competitive bidding and are unable to win certain contracts, we not only incur substantial costs in the bidding process that negatively affect our operating results, but we may lose the opportunity to operate in the market for the services provided under those contracts for a number of years and our revenue will be adversely impacted. Even if we win a particular contract through competitive bidding, our profit margins may be depressed, or we may even suffer losses as a result of the costs incurred through the bidding process and the need to lower our prices to overcome competition.Our contracts may contain provisions that are unfavorable to us and permit our clients to, among other things, terminate our contracts partially or completely at any time prior to completion.Our contracts typically contain provisions that allow our clients to terminate or modify these contracts at their convenience on short notice. If a client terminates one of our contracts for convenience, we generally can only bill the client for work completed prior to the termination, plus any commitments and settlement expenses the client agrees to pay, but not for any work not yet performed. If a client were to terminate, decline to exercise options under, or curtail further performance under one or more of our major contracts, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.15Table of ContentsWe may be unable to realize the level of the anticipated benefits that we expect from our restructuring initiatives, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we have undertaken in the past, and from time to time expect to undertake in the future, restructuring, reorganization, or other strategic initiatives and business transformation plans to realign our resources with our growth strategies, operate more efficiently and control costs. For example, in fiscal 2025, we initiated a global cost reduction plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), including a reduction in force intended to reduce costs and streamline operations. Additionally in fiscal 2025, we completed a reorganization of our business, which included forming discrete operational business units, On-Demand Talent, Consulting, Outsourced Services, and Europe & Asia Pacific and implementing management organizational changes and new reporting modules and processes (the “2025 Reorganization”). The successful implementation of our restructuring activities may from time to time require us to effect business and asset dispositions, workforce reductions, management restructurings, decisions to limit investments in or otherwise exit businesses, office consolidations and closures, and other actions, each of which may depend on a number of factors that may not be within our control.Any such effort to realign or streamline our organization has resulted in, and may in the future result in, the recording of restructuring or other charges, such as asset impairment charges, contract and lease termination costs, exit costs, termination benefits, and other restructuring costs. Further, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and proficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can impact a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Further, upon completion of any restructuring initiatives, our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to the implementation of the plan and we may be unable to achieve anticipated operating enhancements or cost reductions, which would adversely affect our business, competitive position, operating results and financial condition. Our recent digital expansion and technology transformation efforts may not be successful, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.One of our primary areas of focus in recent years is digital expansion, which includes the launching of Project Phoenix, our multi-year technological modernization initiative that requires significant enterprise-wide effort replacing or upgrading core systems. While we've completed phase 1 of Project Phoenix and have launched system upgrades in North America, we continue to make further investments in the transformation of our technology systems to keep up with technological changes that impact the needs of our clients, the delivery of our services and the efficiency of our back-office operations. These investments require significant capital expenditures. If we are unable to execute these initiatives successfully, we may not realize our anticipated return on investment and may not be able to realize the benefits expected, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability. We may not be able to build an efficient support structure as our business continues to grow and transform.In fiscal 2025, we continued our Borderless Talent initiative to continue to evolve towards and facilitate a virtual operating model. With this initiative, we seek to provide borderless solutions, anytime, anywhere, bringing the best talent to meet our clients’ business needs, based on workload, not zip code. We continue to upgrade our cloud-based enterprise-wide operating and Enterprise Resource Planning system. The continued success of these initiatives requires adjusting and strengthening our business operations, financial and talent management systems, procedures, controls and compliance, which may increase our total operating costs and adversely impact our profitability and growth. New business strategies and initiatives, such as these, can be time-consuming for our management team and disruptive to our operations. New business initiatives could also involve significant unanticipated challenges and risks including not advancing our business strategy, not realizing our anticipated return on investment, experiencing difficulty in implementing initiatives, or diverting management’s attention from our other businesses. These events could cause material harm to our business, operating results or financial condition.We may not be able to grow our business, manage our growth or sustain our current business.In fiscal 2025, we initiated the 2025 Restructuring Plan and completed the 2025 Reorganization. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or expand our market presence in our current locations, successfully enter other markets or locations or successfully operate our business virtually without a physical presence in all our markets. Our 16Table of Contentsability to continue to grow our business will depend upon an improving global economy and a number of factors, including our ability to:•grow new client base and penetrate our existing client base;•expand profitably into new geographies;•drive growth in core markets, key industry verticals and solution offerings such as digital transformation services;•provide additional professional service offerings;•hire qualified and experienced consultants;•maintain margins in the face of pricing pressure; and•manage costs.Even if we are able to resume more rapid growth in our revenue, the growth will result in new and increased responsibilities for our management as well as increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls, and our administrative, financial, marketing and other resources. Failure to adequately respond to these new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to serve clients internationally is integral to our strategy and our international activities expose us to additional operational challenges we might not otherwise face.Our international activities require us to confront and manage several risks and expenses we would not face if we conducted our operations solely in the U.S. Any of these risks or expenses could cause a material negative effect on our operating results. These risks and expenses include:•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;•exposure to labor and employment laws and regulations in foreign countries;•expenses associated with customizing our professional services for clients in foreign countries;•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we sell our professional services in denominations other than U.S. dollars;•protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;•political and economic instability in some international markets;•potential personal injury to personnel who may be exposed to military conflicts and other hostile situations in foreign countries;•multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations;•trade barriers and economic sanctions;•compliance with stringent and varying privacy laws in the markets in which we operate;•compliance with regulations on international business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 and the anti-bribery laws of other countries;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•health emergencies or pandemics;•potentially adverse tax consequences; and•restrictions on the ability to repatriate profits to the U.S. or otherwise move funds.We have acquired, and may continue to acquire, companies, and these acquisitions could disrupt our business.We have acquired several companies in the past and we may continue to acquire companies in the future. Entering into an acquisition entails many risks, any of which could harm our business, including:•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•failure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business;•failure to motivate, or loss of, key employees from either our existing business or the acquired business;•failure to identify certain risks or liabilities during the due diligence process;•potential impairment of relationships with our existing employees and clients;•additional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue;•incurrence of significant non-recurring charges;•incurrence of additional debt with restrictive covenants or other limitations;•addition of significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are subject to periodic assessment of impairment, with such non-cash impairment potentially resulting in a material impact on our future financial results and financial condition;17Table of Contents•dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities; and•assumption of liabilities of the acquired company.Our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, including our brand name.We believe establishing, maintaining and enhancing the RGP and Resources Global Professionals brand names are important to our business. We rely on trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand. We have undertaken global rebranding initiatives, including the launch of our tagline ― Dare to Work Differently in fiscal 2022. However, there can be no assurance that our rebranding initiative will result in a positive return on investment. In addition, there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks will be adequate to prevent use of our trademarks by others. Further, not all of our trademarks were successfully registered in all of our desired countries. Accordingly, we may not be able to claim or assert trademark or unfair competition claims against third parties for any number of reasons. For example, a judge, jury or other adjudicative body may find that the conduct of competitors does not infringe or violate our trademark rights. In addition, third parties may claim that the use of our trademarks and branding infringe, dilute or otherwise violate the common law or registered marks of that party, or that our marketing efforts constitute unfair competition. Such claims could result in injunctive relief prohibiting the use of our marks, branding and marketing activities as well as significant damages, fees and costs. If such a claim were made and we were required to change our name or any of our marks, the value of our brand may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Risks Related to AI, Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionOur computer hardware and software and telecommunications systems are susceptible to damage, breach or interruption.We use and rely on various computer, telecommunications and other information systems in the conduct and management of our business. These information systems are vulnerable to security breaches, cyber or other security incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, or other interruptions or damage stemming from power outages, equipment failure or unintended or unauthorized usage by employees. We also rely on information systems and services provided by third parties. We rely on these information systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners and consultants. From time to time, we or our third-party providers experience cybersecurity incidents, interruptions in our operations and system failures, and any loss or breach of data and interruptions or delays in our business or that of our clients, or both, resulting from such incidents, interruptions or failures could have a material impact on our business and operations and materially adversely affect our revenue, profits and operating results.The breadth and complexity of our information systems increases the potential risk of security incidents. Despite our implementation of and periodic updates to security controls, our systems and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses, malware, worms, hackers and other security issues, including physical and electronic break-ins, router disruption, sabotage or espionage, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering (including through social engineering such as phishing attacks), impersonation of authorized users, and coordinated denial-of-service attacks. Cybersecurity incidents may involve the covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, and the use of techniques or processes that change frequently, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of machine learning, AI and quantum computing, may be disguised or difficult to detect, or are designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, and may continue undetected for a period of time. Cybersecurity incidents have in the past resulted from, and may in the future result from, social engineering or impersonation of authorized users, and may also result from efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage.For example, in the past we have experienced cybersecurity incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business or results of operations. However, we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity incidents and attacks and there is no assurance that similar incidents or attacks, or new cybersecurity threats will not arise that, will not cause material impacts in the future. Security incidents, including 18Table of Contentsransomware attacks, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists or others with grievances against the industry in which we operate or us in particular, may disable or damage the proper functioning of our networks and systems and result in a significant disruption of our business and potentially significant payments to restore the networks and systems. We review and update our systems and have implemented processes and procedures to protect against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access to our data, although we cannot provide assurances that these efforts will be successful. While we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents that we believe is appropriate for our operations, our insurance coverage may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost.In addition, the transition of our workforce to a hybrid work environment, where our employees are often working remotely, has also increased our vulnerability to risks related to our hardware and software systems, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. Our systems may be subject to additional risk introduced by software that we license from third parties. This licensed software may introduce vulnerabilities within our own operations as it is integrated with our systems, or as we provide client services through partnership agreements. It is also possible that our security controls over personal and other data may not prevent unauthorized access to, or destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personally identifiable or other proprietary, confidential, sensitive or valuable information of ours or others; this access could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential, personal, Company or client information that others could use to compete against us or for other disruptive, destructive or harmful purposes and outcomes. Any such disclosure or damage to our networks and systems could subject us to third-party claims and governmental investigations and actions against us and reputational harm, including statutory damages under California or other state law, regulatory penalties and significant costs of incident investigation, remediation and notification. If these events occur, our ability to attract new clients or talent may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties. In addition, system-wide or local failures of these information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We use and expect to expand our use of AI and machine learning in our business and challenges with properly managing the development and use of these technologies could result in harm to our reputation, business or clients, legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations.We use AI and machine learning solutions in, and we may in the future integrate additional AI and/or machine learning solutions into, our service and solution offerings, and these AI applications may become more important in our operations over time. As an emerging technology, AI can be costly to implement and we cannot be sure that our use of AI will increase efficiency or provide any other benefits. The use of AI tools and technology presents many challenges and risks to our business, including the risk of bias, miscalculations, data errors and other unintended consequences. Unintended or improper use of AI may lead to regulatory issues, reputational or financial harm, and operational disruptions. The rapid development and adoption of AI and AI-adjacent technology, and of AI’s competitive use cases, may make it more difficult for us to compete in our industry. Our competitors may have greater success implementing and using AI technology than us, which could harm our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may become reliant on AI technology and tools in the future. The legal, regulatory and compliance environment surrounding the design and use of AI technology is evolving and complex. Our obligation to comply with the evolving regulatory landscape could entail significant costs and negatively affect our business. In addition, there has been a significant increase in AI-related litigation and government regulatory actions targeting the design, deployment and other uses of AI, and claiming liability under numerous areas of the law, such as consumer protection, product liability, privacy, intellectual property, securities and defamation. The occurrence of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksFailure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences. In the course of our business, we process, use, disclose, transfer or store personal information required to provide our services. Such personal information is subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy laws which regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices and in some cases consent to collection of personal information; give individuals certain access, correction and deletion rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information, or require providing opt-outs for the use 19Table of Contentsand disclosure of personal information, for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among us and our subsidiaries.Laws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent and complex, and are not uniform, which can increase the cost of compliance and the risks of non-compliance, and may impact our products and services and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) requires us to meet stringent requirements regarding (i) our access, use, disclosure, transfer, security and processing of personal information; and (ii) the ability of data subjects to exercise their related various rights such as to access, correct or delete or limit the use of their personal information. Under the GDPR and the United Kingdom’s version of the GDPR, information transfers from the European Union and the United Kingdom to the United States are generally prohibited unless certain measures are followed. The 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 provide individuals similar rights with respect to the processing of their personal information. In addition, many other states have also enacted comprehensive privacy legislation. There is also the possibility of federal privacy legislation and increased enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission under its power to regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Key markets in the Asia Pacific region have also adopted GDPR-like legislation, including China’s Personal Information Protection Law. Failure to meet Privacy and Data Protection Law requirements could result in significant civil penalties (including fines up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue under the GDPR) as well as criminal penalties. Privacy and data protection law requirements also confer a private right of action in some countries, including under the GDPR.As these laws continue to evolve, we may be required to make changes to our systems, services, solutions and/or products to enable us and/or our clients to meet the new legal requirements, including by taking on more onerous obligations in our contracts, limiting our storage, transfer and processing of data and, in some cases, limiting our service and/or solution offerings in certain locations and our ability to market to customers. Changes in these laws, or the interpretation and application thereof, may also increase our potential exposure through significantly higher potential penalties for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations and client demand in this area may limit the use of, or demand for, our services, solutions and/or products, make it more difficult and costly to meet client expectations, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Failure to comply with governmental, regulatory and legal requirements or with our company-wide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Compliance Policy for Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws, Insider Trading Policy, Code of Vendor Conduct and Ethics and other policies could lead to governmental or legal proceedings that could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are subject to governmental, regulatory and legal requirements in each jurisdiction in which we operate. While we seek to remain in compliance with such legal and regulatory requirements, there may be changes to regulatory schemes in jurisdictions in which we operate that are outside our control and our efforts to remain in compliance with such changes may adversely affect our business and operating results.We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Compliance Policy for Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws, Insider Trading Policy, Code of Vendor Conduct and Ethics and other policies and procedures that are designed to educate and establish the standards of conduct that we expect from our executive officers, outside directors, employees, consultants, independent contractors and vendors. These policies require strict compliance with U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those laws and regulations prohibiting improper payments to government officials. In addition, under U.S. federal securities laws, our executive officers, outside directors, employees, consultants and independent contractors are required to comply with the prohibitions against insider trading of our securities. Nonetheless, we cannot assure our stakeholders that our policies, procedures and related training programs will ensure full compliance with all applicable legal requirements. Illegal or improper conduct by our executive officers, directors, employees, consultants or independent contractors, or others who are subject to our policies and procedures could damage our reputation in the U.S. and internationally, which could adversely affect our existing client relationships or adversely affect our ability to attract and retain new clients, or lead to litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary awards, fines and penalties, as well as disgorgement of profits.20Table of ContentsWe may be legally liable for damages resulting from the actions of our employees, the performance of projects by our consultants or for our clients’ mistreatment of our personnel.Many of our engagements with our clients involve projects or services critical to our clients’ businesses. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. While we are not currently subject to any client-related legal claims which we believe are material, it remains possible, because of the nature of our business, that we may be involved in litigation in the future that could materially affect our future financial results. Claims brought against us could have a serious negative effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Because we are in the business of placing our personnel in the workplaces of other companies, we are subject to possible claims by our personnel alleging discrimination, sexual harassment, negligence and other similar activities by our clients. We may also be subject to similar claims from our clients based on activities by our personnel. We may also be subject to claims of or relating to wrongful termination, violation of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; misclassification of workers as employees or independent contractors; violation of wage and hour requirements and other labor laws; employment of undocumented noncitizens; criminal activity; torts; breach of contract; failure to protect confidential personal information; intentional criminal misconduct; misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property; employee benefits; or other claims. In some cases, we are contractually obligated to indemnify our clients against such risks. The cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain personnel and clients. We could also be subject to injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, monetary damages or fines that may be significant, or other material adverse effects on our business. To reduce our exposure, we maintain policies, procedures and guidelines to promote compliance with laws, rules, regulations and best practices applicable to our business. We also maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. In this regard, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. U.S. courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims.In addition, the use or misuse of social media by our employees or others could reflect negatively on us or our clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The available legal remedies for the use or misuse of social media may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such use or misuse and consequences arising from such actions.Changes in applicable tax laws or adverse results in tax audits or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and also in foreign jurisdictions. Future changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, including changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, are outside our control and are difficult to predict given the political, budgetary and other challenges. Such changes could adversely affect our business and operating results.We are also subject to periodic federal, state and local tax audits for various tax years. Although we attempt to comply with all taxing authority regulations, adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on us.Reclassification of our independent contractors by foreign tax or regulatory authorities could have an adverse effect on our business model and/or could require us to pay significant retroactive wages, taxes and penalties.Internationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the U.S. due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. However, changes to foreign laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of consultants as employees. Such reclassification could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, could require us to pay significant retroactive wages, taxes and penalties, and could force us to change our contractor business model in the foreign jurisdictions affected.21Table of ContentsThe exclusive forum provisions in our Amended and Restated Bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.Our Bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (B) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (C) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (D) any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the “Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision”). The Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.Further, our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). Our decision to adopt the Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law and means that suits brought by stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created under the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.The exclusive forum provisions in our Amended and Restated Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and, accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. The exclusive forum provisions in our Amended and Restated Bylaws may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Further, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.Risks Related to Our Corporate and Capital StructureIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, and this could depress our stock price.Delaware corporate law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that future investors are willing to pay for our shares. These provisions:•authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which can be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance;•divide our Board of Directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term. Because the classification of the Board of Directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors, it may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may make it difficult to change the composition of the Board of Directors;•prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which, if not prohibited, could allow a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to ensure the election of one or more directors;22Table of Contents•require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing;•state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chair of the Board of Directors, by our Chief Executive Officer, by the Board of Directors after a resolution is adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, or by the holders of not less than 10% of our outstanding voting stock;•establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;•provide that certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws can be amended only by supermajority vote (a 66 2/3% majority) of the outstanding shares. In addition, our Board of Directors can amend our Amended and Restated Bylaws by majority vote of the members of our Board of Directors;•allow our directors, not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and•provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors.The terms of our Credit Facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.Prior to July 2, 2025, we had a $175.0 million senior secured loan (the “2021 Credit Facility”) which was scheduled to mature on November 12, 2026. On July 2, 2025, we entered into a new credit agreement that provides for a secured revolving loan, available in an amount up to the lesser of $50.0 million and a borrowing base formula tied to eligible receivables (the “New Credit Facility”), maturing on November 30, 2029. We are subject to various operating covenants under the New Credit Facility which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets. The New Credit Facility also requires us to comply with financial covenants limiting our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum total net leverage ratio. Any failure to comply with these covenants may constitute a breach under the New Credit Facility, which could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments under the New Credit Facility. Our inability to maintain our New Credit Facility could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our business.Our New Credit Facility bears a variable rate of interest that is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) which may have consequences for us that cannot be reasonably predicted and may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings. Borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either, at our election, (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.5% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.5%, with the applicable margin depending on our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the New Credit Facility). Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. It is possible that the volatility of SOFR and the applicable credit adjustment could result in higher borrowing costs for us, and could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings.We could be negatively affected as a result of activist shareholders.We have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions have been and could in the future be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and has diverted and may in the future divert the attention of the Board and management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, clients and prospective and current employees and consultants.We may be unable to or elect not to pay our quarterly dividend payment.We currently pay a regular quarterly dividend, subject to quarterly Board of Directors’ approval. The payment of, or continuation of, the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, tax treatment of dividends in the U.S., contractual restrictions contained in credit agreements and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid in the future. The failure to pay the 23Table of Contentsquarterly dividend, reduction of the quarterly dividend rate or the discontinuance of the quarterly dividend could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.Not applicable.ITEM 1C.    CYBERSECURITY. We have developed an enterprise-wide strategy that we use to assess, identify, and manage material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, malicious attacks, improper employee or contractor access, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy, intellectual property or security laws. Our enterprise risk management program incorporates risks related to cybersecurity threats alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. We also employ a cybersecurity-specific risk assessment process.Our cybersecurity risk strategy uses an Information Assurance Program to define the general security policy for our information systems and a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan for detection, response, recovery, containment, investigation, and analysis following a cybersecurity incident, as well as compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Information Assurance Program addresses the security of information systems and data networks owned or used by us and the information stored, transmitted, or processed by those systems and networks. It defines responsibilities concerning information systems security as well as a uniform approach that promotes information systems security throughout the Company.Our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan is an enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy that focuses on detecting and reacting to cybersecurity incidents, determining their scope and risk, responding appropriately, communicating the results and risk to stakeholders, and reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence. To enhance our in-house capabilities, we leverage expertise from professional services firms and/or outside counsel, as needed, to assess our cybersecurity controls, and inform and collaborate on an ever-changing landscape. We maintain systems that are designed to preempt, detect and monitor cybersecurity threats, including monitoring unusual network activity. As part of our risk management processes, we also perform penetration testing using third-party vendors, conduct periodic cybersecurity awareness training for employees, deploy phishing test campaigns, maintain containment and incident response tools, and periodically review, update and enhance our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan. We utilize various methods to assess and manage risks associated with third-party service providers, which may be reevaluated periodically, such as upon detection of an increase in a third-party’s risk volume and variability. Further, our Code of Vendor Conduct & Ethics sets forth our expectations for third-party vendors related to data privacy and protection. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe that known risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incident that we are aware of, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy results of operations or financial condition. However, we can give no assurance that we have detected or protected against all such cybersecurity incidents or threats or that we will not experience such an incident in the future. Further details about the cybersecurity risks we face are described under “Risks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.24Table of ContentsCybersecurity GovernanceOur Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan is overseen by our Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (“CSIRT”), which is led by our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”). Our CIO is an information technology executive with over 20 years of CIO and Chief Technology Officer experience at publicly traded and privately held companies. His experience has included cybersecurity leadership throughout his executive career. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and an MBA. The other members of the CSIRT include our Vice President of Information Technology who has over 25 years of experience in IT infrastructure, cybersecurity and compliance. He holds a Bachelor of Sciences degree in Electrical Engineering and an MBA. Our virtual Chief Information Security Officer also serves on the CSRIT and is a seasoned vCISO and Principal Security Consultant. He holds multiple certifications including MIS, CISSP, GSEC, GPEN and GCFE. Our IT Compliance and Security Manager also serves on the CSIRT and has over 20 years of IT experience in compliance, audit and security. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology and a Masters of Science degree in Organizational Leadership. The CSIRT is responsible for the Company’s cybersecurity risk management processes described above, including maintaining systems that are designed to preempt, detect and monitor cybersecurity threats, as well as identifying and responding to cybersecurity incidents.Our Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee, oversees the management of our technology-related risks, including information security, data protection, cybersecurity, vendor, fraud, and business continuity risks, and technology-related strategies. The Audit Committee receives updates from the CIO on a quarterly basis, and more frequently as needed, regarding, among other relevant information, existing and new cybersecurity risks, the management and/or mitigation of such risks, material cybersecurity incidents (if any), and status on key cybersecurity initiatives. Our Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee, also actively participates in discussions with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discusses any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs on a timely basis.ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES.We previously owned a building in Irvine, California that consisted of a 57,000 square feet office building, of which approximately 13,000 square feet was leased to an independent third party through July 2024. The remainder of the office space was occupied by our corporate teams and our Orange County, California practice. We sold this building to the City of Irvine, California for a total purchase price of $13.0 million, with such sale closing in August 2024. Following the sale of the building, we entered into a lease agreement for an office space in Irvine, California. The lease commenced on November 1, 2024 and has an expiration date of July 31, 2032.Effective November 1, 2024, we relocated our principal executive office to Dallas, Texas.As of May 31, 2025, we had other major offices in many of the world’s leading business centers, including Atlanta, Beijing, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Houston, London, Los Angeles, New York, Mexico City, Mumbai, San Francisco, Singapore, Seoul, Shanghai, Tokyo and Utrecht, among others. In total, we have facilities and operations in over 38 cities in 14 countries around the world. The majority of our facilities are leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates. As of May 31, 2025, Sitrick which is within Other Segments utilized one of the offices in Los Angeles, California, and another office in New York, New York. All remaining offices are utilized across all other reporting segments. We believe our existing office locations are suitable and adequate to meet our current business needs. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty replacing or locating additional offices to accommodate future needs.ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings; however, we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.ITEM 4.    MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.Not applicable. 25Table of ContentsPART IIITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.Market Information and HoldersOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “RGP.” As of July 18, 2025, the approximate number of holders of record of our common stock was 39 (a holder of record is the name of an individual or entity that an issuer carries in its records as the registered holder (not necessarily the beneficial owner) of the issuer’s securities). Dividend PolicyOur Board of Directors has established a quarterly dividend, subject to quarterly Board of Directors’ approval. Pursuant to declaration and approval by our Board of Directors, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share of common stock during each quarter in fiscal 2024 and 2023, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2025. On April 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of our common stock, which was subsequently paid on July 21, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 23, 2025. Continuation of the quarterly dividend will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business condition, contractual restrictions contained in our current or future credit agreements and other agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Issuances of Unregistered SecuritiesNone.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesOur Board of Directors has previously approved two stock repurchase programs authorizing the repurchase, at the discretion of our senior executives, of our common stock for a designated aggregate dollar limit. In July 2015, the first program was authorized for an aggregate dollar limit not to exceed $150 million, and in October 2024, the second program was authorized for an additional dollar limit not to exceed $50 million (collectively, the “Stock Repurchase Programs”). Subject to the aggregate dollar limits, the currently authorized Stock Repurchase Programs do not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the programs may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. As of May 31, 2025, approximately $79.2 million remained available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the Stock Repurchase Programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.Performance GraphSet forth below is a line graph comparing the annual percentage change in the cumulative total return to the holders of our common stock against the cumulative total return of each of the Russell 3000 Index, a customized peer group consisting of eight companies listed below the following table and a combined classification of companies under Standard Industry Codes as 8742-Management Consulting Services, in each case for the five years ended May 31, 2025.

This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See “Forward Looking Statements” above for further explanation.OverviewResources Global Professionals (“RGP”) is a professional services firm based in Dallas, Texas (with offices worldwide) focused on delivering consulting execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing a combination of bench and on-demand, expert and diverse talent. As a next-generation human capital partner for our clients, we specialize in leadership and co-delivery of enterprise initiatives typically precipitated by business transformation, strategic transactions or regulatory change. Our engagements are designed to leverage human connection and collaboration to deliver practical solutions and more impactful results that power our clients’, employees’ and partners’ success. We attract top-caliber professionals with in-demand skill sets who seek a workplace environment characterized by choice and control, collaboration and human connection. The trends in today’s marketplace favor flexibility and agility as businesses confront transformation pressures and skilled labor shortages even in the face of protracted economic uncertainty. Our client engagement and talent delivery model offers speed and agility, strongly positioning us to help clients transform their businesses and workforce. Our model is especially relevant at a time where cost reduction initiatives drive an enhanced reliance on a flexible workforce to execute transformational projects.We are laser-focused on driving long-term growth in our business by seizing favorable macro shifts in workforce strategies and preferences, building an efficient and scalable operating model, and maintaining a distinctive culture and approach to professional services. Our enterprise initiatives in recent years include refining the operating model for sales, talent and delivery to be more client-centric, cultivating a more robust performance culture by aligning incentives to business performance, enhancing our consulting capabilities in digital transformation to align with market demand, improving operating leverage through pricing, operating efficiency and cost reduction, and driving growth through strategic acquisitions. We believe our focus and execution on these initiatives will serve as the foundation for growth ahead. See Part 1, Item 1 “Business” for further discussions about our business and operations.Fiscal 2025 Strategic Focus AreasIn fiscal 2025, our strategic focus areas were:•Evolve and execute under our new business segments•Launch and activate new brand identity; and•Enhance digital and artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilitiesEvolve and execute under our new business segments – Our first area of focus for fiscal 2025 has been to evolve our business by focusing on three core engagement models: On-Demand Talent, Consulting, and Outsourced Services. This shift has enabled us to better serve our clients along their transformation journey by providing targeted skill sets, high value consulting services, and outsourced delivery under a single umbrella. Our approach combines flexibility, best of breed technology, and human-centered design with functional and subject matter expertise. This fiscal year, we have made tremendous progress in clarifying and operationalizing these models to unlock the cross selling of our diversified capabilities throughout our blue-chip, loyal and longstanding client base. Our growing consulting capability provides us with deeper visibility into our clients’ transformation agendas to drive greater opportunity for our on-demand execution capabilities, while our agile talent base within our on-demand business provides greater financial flexibility and better skill set alignment for our consulting business. In our outsourced services business, we have expanded Countsy’s total addressable market beyond the start-up ecosystem to serve the finance, accounting and human resources needs surrounding spin-outs and carve-outs. Europe and Asia has continued to operate in the geographic regions as one business segment, serving our clients with consulting capabilities and on-demand experts. Evolving our business through this reorganization ensures that we are well positioned to execute and succeed as the macro environment recovers.28Table of ContentsLaunch and activate new brand – In connection with the evolution of our business segments, we also evolved and aligned our
brand identity to clarify to our stakeholders what we do, who we serve, when to call us, and the impact we deliver. We believe the added brand clarity will strengthen our market position and is a critical part of our long-term value creation.Enhance digital and AI capabilities – Our third focus area for fiscal 2025 has been continuing to expand and enhance our technology, digital and data capabilities across all business units. The increased adoption of digital tools, remote work styles, generative AI, and globalization is driving new areas of need within our client base. We are actively adding skilled on-demand and consulting professionals in areas such as technology migration, data modernization and data privacy, and user experience to proactively meet these evolving client needs. Our Digital/Technology and Data practices bring together the unique combination of technology transformation and the deep functional expertise within our consulting practice. We believe this combined offering will uniquely position us to offer our clients integrated end-to-end consulting solutions in the digital arena.We have historically accelerated growth through strategic acquisitions that drive additional scale or expand and complement our existing core capabilities. In addition to enhancing our digital and AI capabilities organically, we acquired Reference Point LLC (“Reference Point”) in July 2024, a management consulting firm with deep technology and data capabilities. We believe the added capabilities from Reference Point has accelerated growth in the existing consulting business and contributed favorably to the execution of our cross selling strategy. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations included in this Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The following represents a summary of our accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, defined as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Revenue recognition — Revenue is recognized when control of the promised service is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for the services. Revenue is recorded net of sales or other transaction taxes collected from clients and remitted to taxing authorities. Revenues for the vast majority of our contracts are recognized over time, based on hours worked by our professionals. The performance of the agreed-upon service over time is the single performance obligation for revenues. On a limited basis, the Company may have fixed-price contracts, for which revenue is recognized over time using the input method based on time incurred as a proportion of estimated total time. Time incurred represents work performed, which corresponds with, and therefore best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. Management uses significant judgments when estimating the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation. It is possible that updated estimates for consulting engagements may vary from initial estimates with such updates being recognized in the period of determination. Depending on the timing of billings and services rendered, the Company accrues or defers revenue as appropriate. Certain clients may receive discounts (for example, volume discounts or rebates) to the amounts billed. These discounts or rebates are considered variable consideration. Management evaluates the facts and circumstances of each contract and client relationship to estimate the variable consideration, assessing the most likely amount to recognize and considering management’s expectation of the volume of services to be provided over the applicable period. Rebates are the largest component of variable consideration and are estimated using the most-likely-amount method prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, contracts terms and estimates of revenue. Revenues are recognized net of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of 29Table of Contentsrevenues will not occur in subsequent periods. Changes in estimates would result in cumulative catch-up adjustments and could materially impact our financial results. Rebates recognized as contra-revenue for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 were $2.2 million, $2.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively.Allowance for credit losses — We maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered. We estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients (which may not include knowledge of all significant events), review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information. While such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past. As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, we had an allowance for credit losses of $2.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and additional allowances may be required. These additional allowances could materially affect our future financial results.Income taxes — In order to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make estimates of income taxes, if applicable, in each jurisdiction in which we operate. The process incorporates an assessment of any income subject to taxation in each jurisdiction together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and, to the extent recovery is not likely, we will establish a valuation allowance. An increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense and any such adjustment may materially affect our future financial results. If the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect our future financial results and financial condition.We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. When all available evidence indicates that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is not required to be recorded or an existing valuation allowance is reversed. Management assesses all available positive and negative evidence, including (1) three-year cumulative pre-tax income or loss adjusted for permanent tax differences, (2) history of operating losses and of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused, (3) evidence of future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, (4) availability of sufficient taxable income in prior years, (5) tax planning strategies, and (6) projection of future taxable income, to determine the need to establish or release a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in valuation allowance will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in tax expense, and any such adjustment may materially affect our future financial results.We also evaluate our uncertain tax positions and only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percentage likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions is recognized in earnings in the period in which such change occurs.As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, a valuation allowance of $29.4 million and $8.6 million was established on deferred tax assets totaling $44.4 million and $34.2 million, respectively. Our income tax for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 was a benefit of $4.3 million, an expense of $8.8 million, and an expense of $18.3 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.Stock-based compensation — Under our 2020 Performance Incentive Plan, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units, options to purchase common stock or other stock or stock-based awards. Under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”), eligible officers and employees may purchase our common stock at a discount in accordance with the terms of the plan. Performance stock unit awards granted under the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan vest upon the achievement of certain company-wide performance targets at the end of the defined three-year performance period. Vesting periods for restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock option awards range from three to four years.30Table of ContentsWe estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant as described below. We determine the estimated value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for our stock options and stock purchased under our ESPP which takes into account assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Additional variables to be considered are the expected term, expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate over the expected term of our employee stock options. We use our historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option award and ESPP award to estimate the expected volatility of the price of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The impact of expected dividends is also incorporated in determining the estimated value per share of employee stock option grants and purchases under our ESPP. Such dividends are subject to quarterly Board of Directors’ approval. Our expected life of stock option grants is 5.6 years for non-officers and 8.1 years for officers, and the expected life of grants under our ESPP is 6 months. In addition, because stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates, and in the case of performance stock units, based on the actual performance. The number of performance stock units earned at the end of the performance period may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. During each reporting period, the Company uses the latest forecasted results to estimate the number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period. Any resulting changes to stock compensation expense are adjusted in the period in which the change in estimates occur. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.We review the underlying assumptions related to stock-based compensation at least annually or more frequently if we believe triggering events exist. If facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ materially from the amount recorded in the current period. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 was $6.8 million, $5.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively.Valuation of long-lived assets — For long-lived tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill, including property and equipment, right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and definite-lived intangible assets, we assess the potential impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets. We performed our assessment of potential qualitative impairment indicators of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets outside of exited under the real estate exit initiatives taken, and definite-lived intangible assets. We determined that for such long-lived assets, no impairment indicators were present as of May 31, 2025, and no impairment charge was recorded during fiscal 2025 for long-lived assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could result in an impairment in the future. Although any impairment is a non-cash expense, it could materially affect our future financial results and financial condition. Goodwill — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make a series of assumptions including forecasted revenue and costs, estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and other factors, which require significant judgment. A potential impairment in the future, although a non-cash expense, could materially affect our financial results and financial condition.In testing the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts. If it is deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, no further testing is needed and goodwill is not impaired. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. We have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If a reporting unit’s estimated 31Table of Contentsfair value is equal to or greater than that reporting unit’s carrying value, no impairment of goodwill exists and the testing is complete. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than the estimated fair value, then a non-cash impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference, not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.Under the quantitative analysis, the estimated fair value of goodwill is determined by using a combination of a market approach and an income approach. The market approach estimates fair value by applying revenue and EBITDA multiples to each reporting unit’s operating performance. The multiples are derived from guideline public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to our reporting units, and are evaluated and adjusted, if needed, based on specific characteristics of the reporting units relative to the selected guideline companies. The market approach requires us to make a series of assumptions that involve significant judgment, such as the selection of comparable companies and the evaluation of the multiples. The income approach estimates fair value based on our estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the relevant risks associated with each reporting unit and the time value of money. The income approach also requires us to make a series of assumptions that involve significant judgment, such as discount rates, revenue, earnings and free cash flow projections. We estimate our discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable guideline public companies. We forecast our revenue, earnings and free cash flows based on historical experience and internal forecasts about future performance. While we believe that the assumptions underlying our quantitative assessment are reasonable, these assumptions could have a significant impact on whether a non-cash impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of our reporting units will be consistent with the Company’s projections. In fiscal 2024, we voluntarily changed the date of the annual impairment test from the last day of the fourth quarter to the first day of the fourth quarter to better align with our internal operations. In fiscal 2025, due to the presence of indicators of potential impairment, we performed quantitative goodwill impairment assessments in each of the fiscal quarters. See Note 5 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Business combinations — We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Purchase price allocations for business acquisitions require significant judgments, particularly with regard to the determination of the value of identifiable assets, liabilities, and goodwill. Often third-party specialists are used to assist in valuations requiring complex estimation. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Purchase agreements related to certain business acquisitions may include provisions for the payment of additional cash consideration if certain future performance conditions are met. These contingent consideration arrangements are recognized at their acquisition date fair value and included as part of the purchase price at the acquisition date. These contingent consideration arrangements are classified as contingent consideration liabilities or other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, with any change in fair value being recognized in the applicable period’s results of operations. Measuring the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date, and for all subsequent remeasurement periods, requires a careful examination of the facts and circumstances to determine the probable resolution of the contingency(ies). We utilize the Monte Carlo simulation model and estimate fair value of the contingent consideration based on unobservable input variables related to meeting the applicable contingency conditions as per the applicable agreements. There were no contingent consideration liabilities as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024. There was no contingent consideration adjustment for the year ended May 31, 2025. The contingent consideration adjustment was a benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended May 25, 2024.Market Trends and UncertaintiesOn a macro level, uncertain macroeconomic conditions including ambiguity around interest rates, softening labor markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, recent government and policy changes implemented in the United States, and tariff actions and uncertainties related to trade wars have created significant uncertainty in the global economy, volatility in the capital markets and recessionary pressures, which has adversely impacted our financial results. While we are not able to fully predict the potential impact, we continue to see caution in professional services spending within our client base. Additionally, in connection with recent actions we have taken to execute on our diversified services strategy for long term growth and stability, we have experienced both voluntary and involuntary attrition, including within our sales team, which have and may continue to affect our near-term revenue performance. If these conditions or impacts persist or if 32Table of Contentsa prolonged economic downturn or recession develops, it could result in further decline in billable hours and negatively impact our bill rates which would adversely affect our financial results and operating cash flows.33Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess our financial and operating performance that are not defined by or calculated in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Consolidated Statements of Operations or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable GAAP measure so calculated and presented.Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our operating results. •Same-day constant currency revenue is adjusted for the following items:•Currency impact. In order to remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we calculate same-day constant currency revenue, which represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior period. •Business days impact. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having a different number of business days, we calculate same-day revenue as current period revenue (adjusted for currency impact) divided by the number of business days in the current period, multiplied by the number of business days in the comparable prior period. The number of business days in each respective period is provided in the “Number of Business Days” section in the table below.•EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before amortization expense, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes.•Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortized Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system costs, technology transformation costs, goodwill impairment, acquisition costs, gain on sale of assets, restructuring costs, and contingent consideration adjustments. We also present herein Adjusted EBITDA at the segment level as a measure used to assess the performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain shared corporate administrative costs that are not practical to allocate. See Note 18 – Segment Information and Enterprise Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.•Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue.34Table of ContentsSame-Day Constant Currency RevenueSame-day constant currency revenue assists management in evaluating revenue trends on a more comparable and consistent basis. We believe this measure also provides more clarity to our investors in evaluating our core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of such performance from period to period. The following table presents a reconciliation of same-day constant currency revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, to revenue as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, by segment (in thousands, except number of business days).

The restructuring credits for the year ended May 27, 2023 related to the release of accrued restructuring liabilities upon completion of the global restructuring and business transformation plans from fiscal 2021.(7) Contingent consideration adjustment related to the remeasurement of contingent liabilities related to the acquisition of CloudGo Pte Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “CloudGo”).Our non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for revenue, net income or other measures of financial performance or financial condition prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our revenue, profitability or liquidity. Further, a limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed above that have an impact on our GAAP-reported results. Other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute but rather considered in addition to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our Consolidated Statements of Operations data. These historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Our operating results for the periods indicated are expressed as a percentage of revenue below.

Revenue decreased $81.5 million, or 12.9%, to $551.3 million for the year ended May 31, 2025 from $632.8 million for the year ended May 25, 2024. On a same-day constant currency basis, revenue during fiscal 2025 37Table of Contentsdecreased $88.1 million, or 13.9%, compared to fiscal 2024. Billable hours decreased 13.5% while the average bill rate remained flat (or increased 0.8% on a constant currency basis) during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease in billable hours is due to reduced client spending, in part due to uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, as a result of interest rate ambiguity and softening labor markets, as well as developments in U.S. trade policy and geo-political conflicts. To a lesser extent, in connection with recent actions we have taken to execute on our diversified services strategy for long term growth and stability, we have experienced both voluntary and involuntary attrition in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, including within our sales team, which affected our revenue performance and billable hours in the second half of fiscal 2025. The following table represents our GAAP consolidated revenues by geography (in thousands, except percentages): For the Years EndedMay 31,2025% ofRevenueMay 25,2024% ofRevenueNorth America$467,201 84.7 %$543,926 86.0 %Europe33,796 6.1 38,383 6.0 Asia Pacific50,334 9.1 50,492 8.0 Total$551,331 100.0 %$632,801 100.0 %North America experienced a revenue decline of 14.1% during fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. This North America revenue decline reflected reduced client spending across a majority of these markets, client segments and solution offerings as a result of the continued uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment. The time to close opportunities in the pipeline continued to be protracted, which is typical in a tougher macro environment when clients are more hesitant and slow down the pace of spend on professional services. To a lesser extent, North America revenue also declined due to the voluntary and involuntary attrition in the third quarter that primarily occurred in North America. This revenue decline was offset by Reference Point, our recent acquisition completed in the first fiscal quarter of 2025, which contributed $16.1 million of North America revenue during fiscal 2025. Europe revenue decreased 12.0%, during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to a decrease in billable hours. Revenue in the Asia Pacific region decreased 0.3% compared to fiscal 2024. Large multinational clients continue to shift work to lower cost markets in the Asia Pacific region, such as India and the Philippines, creating demand in those geographies, which partially mitigated the impact of softer markets in the rest of Asia Pacific. Our acquisition of CloudGo, which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, contributed $6.5 million to Asia Pacific revenue in fiscal 2025 compared to $4.2 million in fiscal 2024 due to the full year impact of the acquisition. We continued to focus on improving pricing during fiscal 2025.Direct Cost of Services. Direct cost of services decreased $42.8 million, or 11.1%, to $343.9 million during fiscal 2025 from $386.7 million for fiscal 2024. The decrease in direct cost of services year over year was primarily attributable to a 13.5% decrease in billable hours as a result of reduced client spending as noted above, partially offset by a 1.7% increase in average pay rate during fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024.Direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.4% for fiscal 2025 compared to 61.1% for fiscal 2024. The increased percentage compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower utilization of salaried consultants. We continue to seek improvement in the overall pay/bill ratio and indirect cost leverage through strategic pricing, while offering competitive compensation and benefits to our consultants to attract and retain the best talent in the marketplace.The number of consultants on assignment at the end of fiscal 2025 was 2,368 compared to 2,585 at the end of fiscal 2024.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) was $202.0 million, or 36.6% of revenue, for the year ended May 31, 2025 compared to $208.9 million, or 33.0% of revenue, for the year ended May 25, 2024. The $6.8 million decrease in SG&A year-over-year was primarily attributed to lower net employee compensation expense of $9.2 million largely resulting from the restructuring plans and ongoing alignment of resource capacity to demand, a $3.4 million gain on the sale of the Irvine office building and a $1.4 million decrease in technology transformation costs. These reductions were partially offset by a $4.4 million favorable non-cash adjustment on contingent consideration related to the CloudGo acquisition recognized in fiscal 2024, a $1.0 million increase in restructuring costs, $1.0 million increase in stock compensation costs and $1.3 million of amortization related to the newly launched ERP systems in the third fiscal quarter. 38Table of ContentsManagement and administrative headcount was 687 at the end of fiscal 2025 and 791 at the end of fiscal 2024. Management and administrative headcount includes full-time equivalent headcount for our seller-doer group, which is determined by utilization levels achieved by the seller-doers. Any unutilized time is converted to full-time equivalent headcount.Goodwill Impairment. During the year ended May 31, 2025, there were indicators of potential impairment in each of the fiscal quarters related to a combination of business performance and decline in share price. As a result, we performed four interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units, each of which is also a reporting segment, during the year ended May 31, 2025, from which we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $194.4 million. See Note 5 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion information.Contingent Consideration Adjustment. In connection with our acquisitions, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified performance targets, such as revenue and operating profit. As of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. Increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. Increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases may have the opposite effect. We remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities' fair value within SG&A in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended May 25, 2024, we recorded a $4.4 million reduction in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of CloudGo. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Income Taxes. Income tax benefit was $4.3 million (effective tax rate of 2.2%) for the year ended May 31, 2025 compared to income tax expense of $8.8 million (effective tax rate of 29.5%) for the year ended May 25, 2024. The income tax benefit in fiscal 2025 was primarily attributed to the Company's pretax loss. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 was due to the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment, coupled with the establishment of valuation allowances on the Company’s domestic and United Kingdom net deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was attributed primarily to a non-recurring increase in forfeiture of stock options in connection with an employee termination during the fiscal year, which was partially offset by rate benefits from the nontaxable income on the reversal of CloudGo's contingent liability, a foreign exchange loss as a result of the repatriation of funds from our Japan subsidiary and a partial release of a valuation allowance on domestic capital loss carryforwards in relation to the then-pending sale of the Company's former Irvine building.We recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively, associated with the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based stock units, and disqualifying dispositions by employees of shares acquired under our ESPP.We reviewed the components of both book and taxable income to prepare the tax provision. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will remain constant in the future because of the lower benefit from the U.S. statutory rate for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the limitation on the benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance for operating loss carryforwards has previously been established, and the unpredictability of timing and the amount of disqualifying dispositions of certain stock options. Based upon ongoing economic circumstances and our business performance, along with the recent goodwill impairment charges, management has currently reserved against deferred tax assets in our domestic and certain foreign jurisdictions, and will continue to monitor the need to record additional or release existing valuation allowances in the future. Realization of the currently reserved deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character in the domestic and foreign territories.We have maintained a position of being indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings by not expecting to remit foreign earnings in the foreseeable future. Being indefinitely reinvested does not require a deferred tax liability to be recognized on the foreign earnings. Management’s indefinite reinvestment position is supported by:39Table of Contents•RGP in the U.S. has generated more than enough cash to fund operations and expansion, including acquisitions. RGP uses its excess cash to, at its discretion, return cash to stockholders through dividend payments and stock repurchases.•RGP has sufficient cash flow from operations in the U.S. to service its debt and other current or known obligations without requiring cash to be remitted from foreign subsidiaries.•Management’s growth objectives include allowing cash to accumulate in RGP’s profitable foreign subsidiaries with the expectation of finding strategic expansion plans to further penetrate RGP’s most successful locations.•The consequences of distributing foreign earnings have historically been deemed to be tax-inefficient for RGP or not materially beneficial. Although we repatriated $2.9 million from our Japan subsidiary during fiscal 2025, the remaining unremitted earnings as of May 31, 2025 in our Japan subsidiary are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our Japan subsidiary's operations and growth, and no deferred tax liability has been established on the remaining unremitted earnings. Going forward, the indefinite reversal criteria will apply only to the portion of our Japan subsidiary’s unremitted earnings that are needed for its ongoing operations and growth.40Table of ContentsOperating Results of SegmentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company completed its assessment of the Company's operating segments and identified the following newly defined operating segments:•On-Demand Talent –
this segment provides businesses with a go-to source for bringing in experts when they need them. •Consulting – this segment drives transformation across people, processes and technology across domain areas including finance, technology and digital, risk and compliance and supply chain transformation. •Europe & Asia Pacific – is a geographically defined segment that offers both on-demand and consulting services (excluding the digital consulting business, which is included in our Consulting segment) to clients throughout Europe and Asia Pacific.•Outsourced Services – operating under the Countsy by RGPTM brand, this segment offers finance, accounting and human resource services provided to startups, spinouts and scale-up enterprises, utilizing a technology platform and fractional team.•Sitrick – a crisis communications and public relations firm that provides corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.Each of these segments reports through a separate segment manager to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who are collectively designated as the CODMs for segment reporting purposes. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of On-Demand Talent, Consulting, Europe & Asia Pacific, and Outsourced Services. Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed under the “All Other” segment. Each of these segments represents a reporting unit for the purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment.On November 15, 2023, the Company acquired CloudGo. On July 1, 2024, the Company acquired Reference Point. CloudGo and Reference Point are both reported as part of the Consulting reporting segment. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.The following table presents our operating results by segment for years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024, and May 27, 2023 respectively (in thousands). Revenue information by segment, on a
GAAP basis and on a same-day constant currency basis, is set forth above under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Same Day Constant Currency Revenue.”41Table of ContentsFor the Years EndedMay 31,2025May 25,2024May 27,2023Adjusted EBITDA:On-Demand Talent$17,116 $31,673 $60,484 Consulting31,718 38,420 53,477 Europe & Asia Pacific4,478 5,289 9,913 Outsourced Services7,581 7,641 7,408 All Other(1,838)(675)1,131 Unallocated items (1)(35,598)(30,865)(32,219)Adjustments:Stock-based compensation expense(6,754)(5,732)(9,521)Amortized ERP system costs (2)(1,287)- - Technology transformation costs (3)(5,474)(6,901)(6,355)Acquisition costs (4)(2,763)(1,970)- Goodwill impairment (5)(194,409)- (2,955)Gain on sale of assets (6)3,420 - - Restructuring cost (7)(5,061)(4,087)364 Amortization expense(5,880)(5,378)(5,018)Depreciation expense(1,868)(3,050)(3,539)Contingent consideration adjustment (8)- 4,400 - Interest income, net544 1,064 (552)Income (loss) before income tax benefit (expense)(196,075)29,829 72,618 Income tax benefit (expense)4,295(8,795)(18,259)Net income (loss)$(191,780)$21,034 $54,359 (1) Unallocated items are generally comprised of unallocated corporate administrative costs, including management and board compensation, corporate support function costs and other general corporate costs that are not allocated to segments.(2) Amortized ERP system costs represent the amortization of capitalized technology transformation costs related to newly implemented ERP system, which was recorded within SG&A on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended May 31, 2025.(3) Technology transformation costs represent costs included in net income (loss) related to the Company’s initiative to upgrade its technology platform globally, including a cloud-based ERP system and talent acquisition and management systems.

The decline was primarily due to lower demand across solution areas amongst economic uncertainty, with billable hours decreasing by 22.7% and a 1.4% (or 1.4% on a constant currency basis) decline in average bill rate. Demand for interim support remained challenged in the year due in part to the labor market trend with less talent movement across employers, which has historically been a generator for demand in this segment.Consulting – Revenue in the Consulting segment declined by $8.8 million or 3.8%, to $219.2 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $228.0 million in fiscal 2024. The decline was primarily due to an 11.0% decrease in billable hours, partially offset by a 7.7% (or 8.5% on a constant currency basis) increase in the average bill rate largely as a result of the Company’s value-based pricing initiative as well as a change in both service and geographic revenue mix. Additionally, the current year results include the addition of Reference Point (acquired in the first fiscal quarter of 2025), which contributed $16.1 million of revenue during fiscal year 2025.Europe and Asia Pacific – Revenue in the Europe and Asia Pacific segment declined by $6.6 million or 7.8%, to $77.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $84.2 million in fiscal 2024. The decline was primarily due to a 4.5% decrease in billable hours, as well as a 3.3% (also 3.3% on a constant currency basis) decrease in the average bill rate largely as a result of a shift in geographic revenue mix toward Asia Pacific where bill rates are lower than Europe. The regions continued to experience delays in decision making and project starts as clients sorted through their own organizational challenges amidst economic uncertainty.Outsourced Services – Revenue in the Outsourced Services segment increased by $1.5 million or 3.9% to $39.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $38.1 million in fiscal 2024. The increase is primarily due to a 2.3% increase in billable hours, partially offset by a 0.7% decline (or 0.7% on a constant currency basis) decrease in the average bill rate. All Other – Revenue in the All Other segment declined by $1.0 million or 9.9% to $8.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $9.9 million in the prior year. The billable hours decreased by 16.3%, partially offset by an increase in average bill rate by 8.4%, partially due to lower fee discounts.Adjusted EBITDA by SegmentOn-Demand Talent – The On-Demand Talent segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $14.6 million or 46.0%, to $17.1 million in fiscal 2025, compared to $31.7 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to the decrease in revenue of $66.6 million as a result of the factors discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $11.5 million.Consulting – The Consulting segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6.7 million or 17.4%, to $31.7 million in fiscal 2025, compared to $38.4 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in revenue of $8.8 million as a result of the factors discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $1.6 million.Europe and Asia Pacific – The Europe and Asia Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $0.8 million or 15.3%, to $4.5 million in fiscal 2025, compared to $5.3 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in gross margin of 1.5%, offset by a decrease in expenses of $2.8 million.Outsourced Services – The Outsourced Services segment’s Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in fiscal 2025 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2024. All Other – The All Other segment's Adjusted EBITDA declined by $1.2 million or 172.3% to $(1.8) million in fiscal 2025 compared to $(0.7) million in fiscal 2024 due to lower revenue performance due to the decrease in billable hours 43Table of ContentsYear Ended May 25, 2024 Compared to Year Ended May 27, 2023For a comparison of our results of operations at the consolidated level for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 22, 2024 (File No. 0-32113).Due to the change in the Company’s operating segments during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as described above, we have presented below a comparison of our results of operations at the segment level based on this new segment presentation for the fiscal years ended March 25, 2024 and March 27, 2023.Revenue by SegmentOn-Demand Talent – Revenue in the On-Demand Talent segment declined by $100.1 million or 26.9%, to $272.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $372.7 million in fiscal 2023. The decline was primarily due to lower demand across solution areas, with billable hours decreasing in fiscal 2024. Demand for interim support remained challenged in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 due in part to continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.Consulting – Revenue in the Consulting segment declined by $32.0 million or 12.3%, to $228.0 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $259.9 million in fiscal 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in billable hours, partially offset by the acquisition of CloudGo (acquired in the second fiscal quarter of 2024), which contributed $4.2 million of revenue during fiscal year 2024.Europe and Asia Pacific – Revenue in the Europe and Asia Pacific segment declined by $9.0 million or 9.6%, to $84.2 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $93.2 million in fiscal 2023. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in the average bill rate as a result of as a result of a shift in revenue mix to regions which have lower average bill rates.Outsourced Services – .Revenue in the Outsourced Services segment decreased by $0.8 million or 2.1% to $38.1 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $39.0 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a 3.3% decrease in billable hours, partially offset by a 4.0% increase in the average bill rate. All Other – Revenue in the All Other segment declined by $1.0 million or 9.1% to $9.9 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $10.9 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a 7.8% decrease in billable hours and a 5.3% decrease in the average bill rate. Revenue was impacted by delays in court proceedings and more settlements, hindering leads for revenue generation in this segment.Adjusted EBITDA by SegmentOn-Demand Talent –The On-Demand Talent segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $28.8 million or 47.6%, to $31.7 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $60.5 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in gross profit of $45.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in segment expenses of $16.5 million.Consulting – The Consulting segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15.1 million or 28.2%, to $38.4 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $53.5 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in gross profit of $17.2 million.Europe and Asia Pacific – The Europe and Asia Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4.6 million or 46.6%, to $5.3 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $9.9 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in gross profit of $3.6 million, as well as an increase in expenses of $1.1 million.Outsourced Services – The Outsourced Services segment’s Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in fiscal 2024 remained relatively flat compared to $7.4 million in fiscal 2023. All Other – The All Other segment's Adjusted EBITDA declined by $1.8 million to $(0.7) million in fiscal 2024 compared to $1.1 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower revenue performance due to the decrease in billable hours and average bill rate described above.44Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, our senior secured revolving credit facility (as discussed further below) and historically, to a lesser extent, stock option exercises and ESPP purchases. During fiscal 2025, we generated positive cash flow from operations and have generated positive cash flows from operations on an annual basis since inception. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future will depend, at least in part, on global economic conditions and our ability to remain resilient during periods of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and any economic downturns. As of May 31, 2025, we had $86.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, including $39.4 million held in international operations.Prior to July 2, 2025, the Company had a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, pursuant to the terms of the credit Agreement dated November 12, 2021 by the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders (the “2021 Credit Facility”). The 2021 Credit Facility provided for a $175.0 million senior secured revolving loan, including a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a swingline sublimit of $20.0 million. The 2021 Credit Facility also included an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to the terms of the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2021 Credit Facility was set to mature on November 12, 2026. The obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility bore interest at a rate per annum of either, at the Company’s election, (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2021 Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 Credit Facility), plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.00% with the applicable margin depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the Company paid an unused commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the 2021 Credit Facility, which ranged from 0.20% to 0.30% depending upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. As of May 31, 2025, we had no debt outstanding and $1.0 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2021 Credit Facility. As of May 31, 2025, there was $174.0 million remaining capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility.The 2021 Credit Facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, dividend distribution and stock repurchases. Additional information regarding the 2021 Credit Facility is included in Note 8 – Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On July 2, 2025, the Company, Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, L/C issuer and swingline lender (the “New Credit Facility”), and concurrently terminated the 2021 Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility provides for a secured revolving loan, available in an amount up to the lesser of $50.0 million and a borrowing base formula tied to eligible receivables, which includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The New Credit Facility also includes an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $15.0 million. The New Credit Facility will mature on November 30, 2029. The obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either, at the Company's election (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, in either case, with the applicable margin depending on the Company's Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the New Credit Facility). The Company is also obligated to pay other customary facility fees for a credit facility of this size and type.On November 2, 2022, Resources Global Enterprise Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd, (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a RMB 13.4 million (USD $1.8 million based on the prevailing exchange rate on November 2, 2022) revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (Beijing) as the lender (the “Beijing Revolver”). The Beijing Revolver bears interest at a loan prime rate plus 0.80%. Interest incurred on borrowings will be payable monthly in arrears. As of May 31, 2025, the Company had no debt outstanding under the Beijing Revolver.45Table of ContentsIn addition to cash needs for ongoing business operations, from time to time, we have strategic initiatives that could generate significant additional cash requirements. Our initiative to upgrade our technology platform, as described in “Fiscal 2025 Strategic Focus Areas” above, requires significant investments over multiple years. Such costs primarily include software licensing fees, third-party implementation and consulting fees, incremental costs associated with additional internal resources needed on the project and other costs in areas including change management and training. As of May 31, 2025, we capitalized $20.8 million related to the technology platform initiative; in addition, we recorded $5.5 million of expenses relating to these investments during fiscal 2025. We launched the new technology platform in most of North America in December 2024. We believe our current cash, ongoing cash flows from our operations and funding available under our Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds for these initiatives. As of May 31, 2025, we have non-cancellable purchase obligations totaling $8.7 million, which primarily consist of payments pursuant to the licensing arrangements that we have entered into in connection with this initiative: $4.4 million due during fiscal 2026; $2.9 million due during fiscal 2027; and $1.4 million due thereafter.In addition, we pay a regular quarterly dividend to our stockholders, subject to approval each quarter by our Board of Directors. Most recently, on April 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.07 per share of our common stock, payable on July 21, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 23, 2025. Continuation of the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business condition, contractual restrictions contained in the New Credit Facility and other agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.On November 15, 2023, the Company acquired CloudGo pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company, CloudGo, and the shareholders of CloudGo (the “CloudGo SPA”). The Company paid initial cash consideration of $7.4 million (net of $0.3 million cash acquired). The CloudGo SPA also provides for contingent consideration of up to $12.0 million to be paid based on CloudGo’s revenue and operating profit margin performance during two one-year performance periods that begin after the acquisition date. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Reference Point MIPA”) with Reference Point and the holder of all the outstanding membership interests of Reference Point, in which the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Reference Point. The Company paid cash consideration of $23.2 million (net of $0.2 million cash acquired). See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.As described under "Market Trends and Uncertainties" above, uncertain macroeconomic conditions including ambiguity around interest rates, softening labor markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, recent government and policy changes implemented in the United States, and tariff actions and uncertainties related to trade wars have created significant uncertainty in the global economy, volatility in the capital markets and recessionary pressures, which have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our financial results, operating cash flows and liquidity needs. If we are required to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness for our operations or to invest in our business, we can provide no assurances that we would be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all. Our ongoing operations and growth strategy may require us to continue to make investments in critical markets and further expand our internal technology and digital capabilities. In addition, we may consider making additional strategic acquisitions or initiating additional restructuring initiatives, which could require significant liquidity and adversely impact our financial results due to higher cost of borrowings. We believe that our current cash, ongoing cash flows from our operations and funding available under our New Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months.Beyond the next 12 months, if we require additional capital resources to grow our business, either organically or through acquisitions, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, increase the use of our New Credit Facility, expand the size of our New Credit Facility or raise additional debt. In addition, if we decide to make additional share repurchases, we may fund these through existing cash balances or the use of our New Credit Facility. The sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Our ability to secure additional financing in the future, if needed, will depend on several factors. These include our future profitability and the overall condition of the credit markets. Notwithstanding these considerations, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.46Table of ContentsOperating Activities, Fiscal 2025 and 2024Operating activities provided cash of $18.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $21.9 million in fiscal 2024. The cash provided by operations during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a net loss of $191.8 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $200.8 million, which included a $194.4 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, during fiscal 2025, net favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $9.9 million, primarily consisting of a $10.4 million decrease in trade accounts receivable and a $3.1 million increase in accrued salaries and related obligations, mainly due to the timing of our pay cycle, and a $1.9 million change in other liabilities. This favorable change was partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $1.2 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.During fiscal 2024, cash provided from operations resulted from net income of $21.0 million and non-cash adjustments of $11.2 million. Additionally, during fiscal 2024, net unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $10.4 million, primarily consisting of a $24.5 million decrease in accrued salaries and related obligations, mainly due to the timing of our pay cycle and the payout of the annual incentive compensation during fiscal 2024, a $9.9 million increase in other assets largely related to the investments in our technology implementation, a $3.3 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $1.9 million decrease in other liabilities, and a $0.8 million increase in prepaids and other assets. These unfavorable changes are partially offset by a $29.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivable.Investing Activities, Fiscal 2025 and 2024Net cash used in investing activities was $13.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to net cash used of $8.6 million in fiscal 2024. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 was primarily related to the net $23.2 million of cash used for the acquisition of Reference Point and $2.7 million of cash used for the development of internal-use software and acquisition of property and equipment, partially offset by the $12.3 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Irvine office building. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily related to the net $7.4 million acquisition of CloudGo and $1.1 million of costs incurred for the development of internal-use software and acquisition of property and equipment.Financing Activities, Fiscal 2025 and 2024For the past three fiscal years, the primary sources of cash in financing activities are borrowings under our 2021 Credit Facility, cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the issuance of shares purchased under our ESPP. The primary uses of cash in financing activities are repayments under the 2021 Credit Facility, repurchases of our common stock and cash dividend payments to our stockholders.Net cash used in financing activities totaled $27.7 million during fiscal 2025 compared to $20.7 million during fiscal 2024. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2025 consisted of $13.0 million to purchase 1,382,820 shares of common stock on the open market and cash dividend payments of $18.6 million; these uses were partially offset by $3.9 million in proceeds received from ESPP share purchases and employee stock option exercises. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2024 consisted of $8.0 million to purchase 606,254 shares of common stock on the open market and cash dividend payments of $18.8 million; these uses were partially offset by $6.1 million in proceeds received from ESPP share purchases and employee stock option exercises.For a comparison of our cash flow activities for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 22, 2024 (File No. 0-32113).Recent Accounting PronouncementsInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.47Table of ContentsITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.Interest Rate Risk. We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash and cash equivalents and our borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility that bore interest at a variable market rate. As of May 31, 2025, we had approximately $86.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings under our 2021 Credit Facility. The earnings on cash and cash equivalents are subject to changes in interest rates; however, assuming a constant balance available for investment, a 10% decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income but would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We may become exposed to interest rate risk related to fluctuations in the term SOFR rate used under our New Credit Facility. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the interest rate on our 2021 Credit Facility and New Credit Facility. As of May 31, 2025, we had no borrowings outstanding and $1.0 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our 2021 Credit Facility.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. For the year ended May 31, 2025, approximately 18.2% of our revenues were generated outside of the U.S. compared to approximately 17.8% of our revenues for the year ended May 25, 2024. As a result, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Thus, as the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non-U.S.-based operations, our reported results may vary.Assets and liabilities of our non-U.S.-based operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period. Approximately 54.2% of our cash and cash equivalents balances as of May 31, 2025 were denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining amount of approximately 45.8% was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from Euros, Mexican Pesos, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and British Pound Sterling. This compares to approximately 59.2% of our cash and cash equivalents balances as of May 25, 2024 that were denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 40.8% that were comprised primarily of cash balances translated from Euros, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Canadian Dollars. The difference resulting from the translation in each period of assets and liabilities of our non-U.S.-based operations is recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.Although we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, we do not currently use financial hedges to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations including in a limited number of circumstances when we may be asked to transact with our client in one currency but are obligated to pay our consultants in another currency. Our foreign entities typically transact with clients and consultants in their local currencies and generate enough operating cash flows to fund their own operations. We believe our economic exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future.48Table of ContentsITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.RESOURCES CONNECTION, INC.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPageReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm50Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 202453Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 202554Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 202555Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 202556Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 202557Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements5849Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Resources Connection, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Resources Connection, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.50Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee of the board of directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of this critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Annual and Interim Goodwill Impairment AssessmentsAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net goodwill balance was $28.8 million as of May 31, 2025. The Company tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually on the first day of the last quarter of the fiscal year or more frequently if facts, events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.On May 26, 2024, management realigned its reporting units due to a change in organizational structure. Reporting units under the former structure were tested for impairment prior to the realignment, and no impairment was identified. As a result of the realignment, the Company reallocated its existing goodwill to its new reporting units which resulted from the change in its operating segments. Goodwill was reassigned to each of the new reporting units using a relative fair value approach and reconciled to its market capitalization. Management assessed the goodwill of the new reporting units for impairment as of May 26, 2024 and determined that there was $3.8 million of goodwill impairment in the Europe & Asia Pacific reporting unit.During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2025, the Company experienced a sustained decline in its stock price resulting in the market capitalization being less than the carrying value of the combined reporting units. After considering all available evidence in the evaluation of goodwill impairment indicators, management determined it appropriate to perform interim quantitative assessments of the reporting units during those periods. As a result of these quantitative assessments performed, the Company incurred an aggregate impairment charge of $190.6 million for fiscal year 2025 in the On-Demand Talent, Consulting and Europe & Asia Pacific reporting units.The Company’s determination of the estimated fair value for each reporting unit was based on a market-based approach, income-based approach or a combination of both approaches. The market-based approach was based on the guideline public company method, which uses market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for a group of comparable public companies. The income-based approach was based on the present value of discounted cash flows of each reporting unit, using the Company’s assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, forecasted gross profit margins, forecasted earnings and free cash flows, terminal period growth rates, and other economic and market trends. Additionally, the present value was based on applying a weighted average cost of capital, which considered long-term interest rates and cost of equity based on the reporting segment’s risk profile.We identified the valuation of goodwill as a critical audit matter given the significant estimates and assumptions the Company makes to determine the fair value of the reporting unit including revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA margin and discount rates. Auditing the reasonableness of the Company’s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased audit effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists.Our audit procedures related to the valuation of goodwill for each reporting unit included the following, among others:•We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the Company’s goodwill valuation and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including management’s review of the significant assumptions used in the estimate of fair value.51Table of Contents•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of revenue growth rates by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, and (2) external market data.•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue by comparing the forecasts to the historical results, and comparison to guideline public companies.•With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodologies and significant assumptions by:•Evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rates by comparing the underlying source information to publicly available market data and verifying the accuracy of the calculations. •Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods used by management and testing the mathematical accuracy./s/ RSM US LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.Irvine, CaliforniaJuly 28, 202552Table of ContentsRESOURCES CONNECTION,

Description of the Company and its BusinessResources Connection, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on November 16, 1998. The Company’s operating entities provide services primarily under the name Resources Global Professionals (“RGP”). RGP is a professional services firm focused on delivering consulting execution services that power clients’ operational needs and change initiatives utilizing a combination of bench and on-demand, expert and diverse talent. As a next-generation human capital partner for its clients, the Company specializes in leadership and co-delivery of enterprise initiatives typically precipitated by business transformation, strategic transactions, or regulatory change. The Company’s principal markets of operations are North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The Company’s fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday in May closest to May 31. Fiscal year 2025 consisted of three 13-week quarters and one 14-week fourth quarter for a total of 53 weeks.
Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 consisted of four 13-week quarters and included a total of 52 weeks of activity in each fiscal year. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company (“financial statements”) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Reporting SegmentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Chief Executive Officer announced a decision to reorganize the Company’s business by forming multiple discrete operational business units. To align the new operating model and financial reporting, the Company made management organizational changes and implemented new reporting modules and processes to provide discrete information to manage the business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company completed its assessment of the Company's operating segments and identified the following newly defined operating segments:•On-Demand Talent – this segment provides businesses with a go-to source for bringing in experts when they need them. •Consulting – this segment drives transformation across people, processes and technology across domain areas including finance, technology and digital, risk and compliance and supply chain transformation. •Europe & Asia Pacific – is a geographically defined segment that offers both on-demand and consulting services (excluding the digital consulting business, which is included in our Consulting segment) to clients throughout Europe and Asia Pacific.•Outsourced Services – operating under the Countsy by RGPTM brand, this segment offers finance, accounting and HR services provided to startups, spinouts and scale-up enterprises, utilizing a technology platform and fractional team.•Sitrick – a crisis communications and public relations firm that provides corporate, financial, transactional and crisis communication and management services.Each of these segments reports through a separate segment manager to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who are collectively designated as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for segment reporting purposes. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of On-Demand Talent, Consulting, Europe & Asia Pacific, and Outsourced Services. Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed under the “All Other” segment. Each of these segments represents a reporting unit for the purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment.58Table of ContentsOn November 15, 2023, the Company acquired CloudGo Pte Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “CloudGo”). On July 1, 2024, the Company acquired Reference Point LLC (“Reference Point”). CloudGo and Reference Point are both reported as part of the Consulting operating segment. See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ReclassificationsCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported totals for assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, cash flows or net income. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are adequate, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates substantially all of its revenues from providing professional consulting services to its clients. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised service is transferred to the Company’s clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for the services rendered. Revenue is recorded net of sales or other transaction taxes collected from clients and remitted to taxing authorities. Revenues for the vast majority of our contracts are recognized over time, based on hours worked by the Company’s professionals. The performance of the agreed-to service over time is the single performance obligation for revenues. Certain clients may receive discounts (for example, volume discounts or rebates) to the amounts billed. These discounts or rebates are considered variable consideration. Management evaluates the facts and circumstances of each contract and client relationship to estimate the variable consideration assessing the most likely amount to recognize and considering management’s expectation of the volume of services to be provided over the applicable period. Rebates are the largest component of variable consideration and are estimated using the most-likely-amount method, contracts terms and estimates of revenue. Revenues are recognized net of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenues will not occur in subsequent periods. On a limited basis, the Company may have fixed-price contracts, for which revenues are recognized over time using the input method based on time incurred as a proportion of estimated total time. Time incurred represents work performed, which corresponds with, and therefore best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. Management uses significant judgments when estimating the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation. It is possible that updated estimates for consulting engagements may vary from initial estimates with such updates being recognized in the period of determination. Depending on the timing of billings and services rendered, the Company accrues or defers revenue as appropriate. The Company recognizes revenues primarily on a gross basis as it acts as a principal for primarily all of its revenue transactions. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because it controls the services before they are transferred to the customers. The Company a) has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified consultants; b) has the discretion to select the consultants and establish the price and responsibilities for services to be provided; c) is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the service to the customer; and d) bears the risk for services provided that are not fully paid for by clients. The Company recognizes all reimbursements received from clients for “out-of-pocket” expenses as revenue and all such expenses as direct cost of services. Reimbursements received from clients were $4.4 million, $4.3 million and $4.7 million for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024, and May 27, 2023, respectively. Commissions earned by the Company’s sales professionals are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred as the expected amortization period is one year or less. Sales commissions are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, sales commission expense was $3.1 million, $2.8 million, and $3.3 million, respectively.The Company’s clients are contractually obligated to pay the Company for all hours billed. The Company invoices most of its clients on a weekly basis or, in certain circumstances, on a bi-weekly or monthly basis, and its typical 59Table of Contentsarrangement of payment is due within 30 days. To a much lesser extent, in certain circumstances, the Company also earns revenue if one of its consultants is hired by, or if the Company places an outside candidate with, its client. Conversion fees or permanent placement fees are recognized when one of the Company’s professionals, or a candidate identified by the Company, accepts an offer of permanent employment from a client and all requisite terms of the agreement have been met. Such conversion fees or permanent placement fees are recognized when the performance obligation is considered complete, which the Company considers a) when the consultant or candidate accepts the position; b) the consultant or candidate has notified either RGP or their current employer of their decision; and c) the start date is within the Company’s current quarter. Conversion fees were 0.2% of revenue for the year ended May 31, 2025, and 0.3% of revenue for each of the years ended May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023. Permanent placement fees were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% of revenue for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively.The Company’s contracts generally have termination-for-convenience provisions and do not have termination penalties. While clients are contractually obligated to pay the Company for all hours billed, the Company does not have long-term agreements with its clients for the provision of services and the Company’s clients may terminate engagements at any time. All costs of compensating the Company’s professionals for services provided are the responsibility of the Company and are included in direct cost of services. Foreign Currency TranslationThe financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States (“U.S.”) are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates, income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of comprehensive income or loss within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Per Share InformationThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include the assumed exercise of outstanding in-the-money stock options, assumed issuance of common stock under the Company's 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”), assumed release of outstanding restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) using the treasury stock method. However, potentially dilutive shares of common stock are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.During the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company incurred a net loss, and as a result potentially dilutive common shares issuable from the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed release of shares of common stock under the outstanding ESPP, RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs awards were not included in the diluted shares used to calculate net loss per share, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.60Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the calculation of net income (loss) per share for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts): For the Years EndedMay 31,2025May 25,2024May 27,2023Net income (loss)$(191,780)$21,034$54,359Weighted-average shares outstanding:Basic weighted-average shares33,06333,44533,407Effect of dilutive shares:Weighted-average shares — Basic33,06333,44533,407Potentially dilutive stock options- 48359Potentially dilutive employee stock purchase plan- 148 Potentially dilutive restricted stock awards- 5664Potentially dilutive restricted stock units- 179233Potentially dilutive performance stock units- 153114Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding33,06333,89534,185Net income (loss) per common share:Basic $(5.80)$0.63$1.63Dilutive$(5.80)$0.62$1.59Anti-dilutive shares not included above2,7302,152704Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers cash on hand, deposits in banks, and short-term investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.Restricted CashRestricted cash consists of cash and claims to cash that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. This includes cash designated for specific use in an acquisition or dissolution. Financial InstrumentsThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels:Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets.Level 3 – Unobservable inputs.Contingent consideration liability is for estimated future contingent consideration payments related to the Company’s acquisitions. Total contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of CloudGo were preliminarily valued at $4.4 million as of November 25, 2023 and zero as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively. As a result, no further remeasurements or revisions are required. The fair value measurement of the liability was based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability at these dates were the Company’s measures of the estimated payouts based on internally generated financial projections and discount rates. The fair value of contingent 61Table of Contentsconsideration liability will be remeasured on a quarterly basis until settlement by the Company using additional information as it becomes available, and any change in the fair value estimates will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future revisions to these significant unobservable inputs and the assumptions underlying them could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore could materially affect the Company’s future operating results.The Company’s remaining financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses, and long-term debt, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or because their stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from its clients’ failure to make required payments for services rendered. Management estimates this allowance based upon knowledge of the financial condition of the Company’s clients (which may not include knowledge of all significant events), review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information. If the financial condition of the Company’s clients deteriorates or there is an unfavorable trend in aggregate receivable collections, additional allowances may be required. The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses (in thousands): BeginningBalanceCharged to OperationsCurrency RateChangesOther(Write-offs)/RecoveriesEndingBalanceYears Ended:May 27, 2023$2,121 $1,440 $1 $- $(279)$3,283 May 25, 2024$3,283 $137 $5 $2 $(672)$2,755 May 31, 2025$2,755 $1,239 $(15)$- $(1,376)$2,603 Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleAssets and liabilities held for sale primarily represent property and equipment, and other assets and liabilities that have met the criteria of “held for sale” accounting, as specified by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. The effect of suspending amortization on noncurrent assets held for sale is immaterial to the results of operations. The Company records assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset or disposal group until the date of sale. On February 24, 2024, the Company determined the asset groups associated with the Company's former corporate office in Irvine, California met the criteria of held for sale, since the Company intended to complete the sale of these assets within the twelve months following the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company concluded that the offering price of the disposal assets was an approximate fair value. The Company sold its Irvine, California corporate office in August 2024. See Note 4 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for further information.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Furniture and fixtures5 to 10 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of useful life of asset or term of leaseComputer, equipment and software3 to 5 yearsCosts for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed to operations as incurred, while renewals and major refurbishments are capitalized.62Table of ContentsLong-lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The impairment test is comprised of two steps. The first step compares the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, no impairment is taken. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a second step is warranted and an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. The Company recorded an impairment against its right of use (“ROU”) assets and leasehold improvements of zero, $0.2 million and zero for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively, primarily associated with exiting certain real estate leases as part of its restructuring initiatives. The impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but the carrying value is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company voluntarily changed the date of the annual impairment test from the last day of the fourth quarter to the first day of the fourth quarter to better align with our internal operations. This change was applied prospectively and was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level. Under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows or planned revenue or earnings of the reporting unit as potential indicators when determining the need for a quantitative assessment of impairment. Under the quantitative analysis, the fair value of the reporting units is determined by using a market-based approach, an income-based approach or a combination thereof. The market-based approach estimates fair value by applying revenue and EBITDA multiples to each reporting unit’s operating performance. The multiples are derived from guideline public companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the Company's reporting units, and are evaluated and adjusted, if needed, based on specific characteristics of the reporting units relative to the selected guideline companies. The market-based approach requires the Company to make a series of assumptions that involve significant judgment, such as the selection of comparable companies and the evaluation of the multiples. The income-based approach estimates fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the relevant risks associated with each reporting unit and the time value of money. The income approach also requires a series of assumptions that involve significant judgment, such as revenue projections and Adjusted EBITDA margin projections, which are based on historical experience and internal forecasts about future performance.While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its quantitative assessment are reasonable, these assumptions could have a significant impact on whether a non-cash impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will be consistent with the Company’s projections.The Company’s identifiable intangible assets include customer contracts and relationships, and computer software, including internally-developed software. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from one to twelve years. For intangible assets subject to amortization, if the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets. The Company reviewed its intangible assets and did not identify any impairment during the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023.See Note 5 —Goodwill and Intangible Assets for a further description of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets, including information about the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment.63Table of ContentsLeasesThe Company currently leases office space, vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2034. At May 31, 2025, the Company had no finance leases. The Company’s operating leases are primarily for real estate, which include fixed payments plus, in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of common area maintenance, operating expenses and real estate taxes applicable to the property. Variable payments are excluded from the measurements of lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Any tenant improvement allowances received from the lessor are recorded as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. None of the Company’s lease agreements contained residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company has not entered into any real estate lease arrangements where it occupies the entire building. As such, the Company does not have any separate land lease components embedded within any of its real estate leases.The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract. Specifically, the Company considers whether it can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the assets. The ROU assets represent the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. The Company’s lease liability is recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s ROU asset is recognized as of the lease commencement date at the amount of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. The Company evaluates its ROU assets for impairment consistent with its policy for evaluating long-lived assets for impairment. See “Long-lived Assets” above. ROU assets are presented as operating ROU assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease liabilities are presented as operating lease liabilities, current or operating lease liabilities, noncurrent in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets based on their contractual due dates. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.Most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be readily determined. Therefore, the Company uses a discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate and the information available at the commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the total lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the portfolio approach is applied in determining the incremental borrowing rate. Application at the portfolio level is not materially different from applying guidance at the individual lease level.Certain of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew or terminate the lease at the Company’s discretion. Generally, the renewal and termination options are not included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. The Company regularly evaluates lease renewal and termination options and, when they are reasonably certain of exercise, includes the renewal or termination option in the lease term.In some instances, the Company subleases excess office space to third-party tenants. The Company, as sublessor, continues to account for the head lease. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, this indicates that the ROU asset associated with the head lease should be assessed for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions. Sublease income is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company has elected the practical expedient that allows lessees to choose to not separate lease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset and is applying this expedient to all real estate asset classes. Additionally, the Company has also made an accounting policy election to recognize the lease payments under short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term without recognizing the lease liability and the ROU asset.See Note 7 — Leases for further information on the Company’s leases.Capitalized Hosting ArrangementsThe capitalized hosting arrangements costs are primarily related to the Company’s implementation of a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system and talent acquisition and management system. Such costs include third party implementation costs and costs associated with internal resources directly involved in the implementation. Capitalized hosting arrangements are stated at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of the expected term of the hosting arrangement, taking into consideration several other factors such as, but not limited to, options to extend the hosting arrangement or options to terminate the hosting arrangement. The amortization of capitalized 64Table of Contentsimplementation costs for hosting arrangements will commence when the systems are ready for their intended use and will be presented as operating expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the presentation for expensing the fees for the associated hosting arrangement.As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, the capitalized costs related to hosting arrangements incurred during the application development stage were $20.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively. These capitalized hosting arrangements are included in current and other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, amortization was $1.8 million and less than $0.2 million, respectively. No costs were amortized during the year ended May 27, 2023.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, employee stock options, performance stock units awarded under the Company’s 2020 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) and the Company’s 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), stock units credited under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and employee stock purchases made via the Company’s 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “ESPP”), based on estimated fair value at the date of grant.The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options, including options under the ESPP, and the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense over the requisite service periods. If the actual number of forfeitures, and in the case of performance stock units, the actual performance, differs from that estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. Excess income tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based compensation are recognized as a discrete item within the provision for income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Stock options and restricted stock units typically vest over three to four years and restricted stock award vesting is determined on an individual grant basis under the 2014 Plan or the 2020 Plan. Performance stock units vest on the last day of the three-year performance period, based on the actual performance for the performance period.See Note 15 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans for further information on the 2020 Plan and stock-based compensation.Income TaxesThe Company recognizes deferred income taxes for the estimated tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized when, in management’s opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company also evaluates its uncertain tax positions and only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions is recognized in earnings in the period in which such change occurs. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters, if applicable, in income tax expense.Share Repurchases and Retirement of Treasury SharesThe Company’s stock repurchase programs authorize the Company to repurchase shares at the discretion of the Company’s senior executives based on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, the Company’s ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, and other demands for cash. The Company records the shares repurchased as treasury stock based on the amount paid to repurchase its shares. Direct costs incurred to acquire treasury stock are treated like stock issue costs and added to the cost of the treasury stock.65Table of ContentsThe Company accounts for the retirement of treasury shares using the par-value method under which the cost of repurchased and retired treasury shares in excess of the par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. When the repurchase price is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. The Company uses the weighted-average cost flow assumption to identify and assign the original issue proceeds to the cost of the repurchased and retired treasury shares. The Company believes that this allocation method is preferable because it more accurately reflects its paid-in capital balances by allocating the cost of the repurchased and retired treasury shares to paid-in capital in proportion to paid-in capital associated with the original issuance of those shares.See Note 12 — Stockholders’ Equity for further information on the repurchase of shares.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecently Issued Accounting GuidanceIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses requiring disaggregated disclosure of certain expense captions into specified categories in the notes to financial statements on an annual and interim basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with updates to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance in its fiscal year beginning May 30, 2027. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its financial statement disclosures.In December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The guidance is intended to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2023-09 for fiscal year 2026, which began on June 1, 2025, and is in the process of implementing the related disclosure requirements.Recently Adopted Accounting GuidanceIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The guidance is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements for public entities primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. For additional information, refer to Note 18 – Segment Information and Enterprise Reporting.Other recent changes in authoritative accounting pronouncements did not, or are not expected to, have a materially significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.3. Acquisitions and DispositionsAcquisition of Reference PointOn July 1, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Reference Point MIPA”) with Reference Point LLC (“Reference Point”) and the holder of all the outstanding membership interests of Reference Point LLC, in which the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Reference Point. Reference Point is a strategy, management, and technology consulting firm serving the financial services sector across four areas of focus: Strategy & Management, Risk & Regulatory Compliance, Digital & Technology and Data & Analytics. The Company paid cash consideration of $23.2 million (net of $0.2 million cash acquired).Results of operations of Reference Point are included within the Consulting Services operating segment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition. Reference Point contributed $16.1 million of revenue and $1.9 million of operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended May 31, 2025. During the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company recognized approximately $2.8 million of acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Reference Point that were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.66Table of ContentsIn accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company made an initial provisional allocation of the purchase price for Reference Point based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the residual amount recorded as goodwill. The Company’s purchase price allocation considered a number of factors, including the valuation of identifiable intangible assets. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded total intangible assets consisting of $14.4 million for customer relationships (to be amortized over 12 years), $0.7 million related to a non-compete agreement (to be amortized over 5 years) and $0.6 million for trade name (to be amortized over 1 year). The Company also recorded $6.9 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of Reference Point.The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition of Reference Point and the amounts of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:Fair value of consideration transferred (in thousands):Cash$23,417 Recognized provisional amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):Cash and cash equivalents$248 Trade accounts receivable (1)2,013 Prepaid expenses and other current assets52 Intangible assets15,720 Property and equipment28 Other non-current assets63 Total identifiable assets18,124 Accounts payable and other accrued expenses47 Accrued salaries and related obligations988 Other liabilities527 Total liabilities assumed1,562 Net identifiable assets acquired16,562 Goodwill6,855 Net assets acquired$23,417 (1)As of the acquisition date, the gross contractual amount of accounts receivable of $2.0 million was expected to be fully collected, and was fully collected during fiscal 2025.The weighted-average useful life of all Reference Point's intangible assets is 11.3 years.Acquisition of CloudGoOn November 15, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in CloudGo pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company, CloudGo, and the shareholders of CloudGo (the “CloudGo SPA”). Headquartered in Singapore, CloudGo is a digital transformation firm primarily focused on technology implementation through the ServiceNow platform. The Company paid cash consideration of $7.4 million (net of $0.3 million of cash acquired).In addition, the CloudGo SPA provides for contingent consideration of up to $12.0 million to be paid based on CloudGo’s revenue and operating profit margin performance during two one-year performance periods that began after the acquisition date. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the application of an appropriate discount rate (Level 3 fair value). The preliminary fair value of the contractual obligation to pay the contingent consideration amounted to $4.4 million. Due to a revision in the Company's estimate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company decreased the fair value of the CloudGo contingent consideration liability to zero. The Company has concluded that a fair value of zero for the contingent consideration liability as of May 31, 2025 was appropriate. The estimate of fair value of contingent consideration liability requires assumptions to be made of various levels of potential revenue and operating profit performance as well as discount rates. 67Table of ContentsFuture revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore could materially affect the Company’s future operating results. Results of operations of CloudGo are included within the Consulting Services operating segment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition. CloudGo contributed $6.5 million
and
$4.2 million of revenue to the consolidated results of operations during the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively. During the year ended May 25, 2024, the Company recognized approximately $2.0 million of acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of CloudGo. Such costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company made an allocation of the purchase price for CloudGo based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the residual amount recorded as goodwill. The Company’s purchase price allocation considered a number of factors, including the valuation of identifiable intangible assets. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded total intangible assets consisting of $3.1 million for customer relationships (to be amortized over 9 to 12 years). The Company also recorded $9.6 million of goodwill. The goodwill is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of CloudGo.The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition of CloudGo and the amounts of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:Fair value of consideration transferred (in thousands):Cash$7,753 Contingent consideration4,400 Total$12,153 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):Cash and cash equivalents$342 Trade accounts receivable (1)778 Prepaid expenses and other current assets78 Income taxes receivable2 Intangible assets3,100 Property and equipment36 Other non-current assets13 Total identifiable assets4,349 Accounts payable and other accrued expenses 411 Accrued salaries and related obligations 366 Deferred tax liabilities490 Other liabilities566 Total liabilities assumed1,833 Net identifiable assets acquired2,516 Goodwill 9,637 Net assets acquired$12,153 (1) As of the acquisition date, the gross contractual amount of accounts receivable of $0.8 million was expected to be fully collected, and was subsequently collected.The weighted-average useful life of CloudGo’s customer relationships and intangible assets is approximately 10.9 years.68Table of ContentsDispositionsDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed the dissolution of the following three foreign subsidiaries: Compliance.co.uk Ltd, Resources Compliance (UK) Ltd and RGP Poland spolka z ograniczona odpowiedzialnoscia. The Company recognized a total net loss on dissolutions of $0.5 million during fiscal 2023. This net loss was primarily related to the recognition of the accumulated translation adjustment associated with the foreign subsidiaries, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended May 27, 2023.None of the markets sold or exited in fiscal 2023 were considered strategic components of the Company’s operations.4. Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleAs of February 24, 2024, the Company determined the asset groups associated with its former corporate office in Irvine, California met the criteria of held for sale, since the Company intended to complete the sale of these assets within the twelve months following the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Accordingly, the related assets classified as held for sale are separately presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 25, 2024. In addition, such assets are presented at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. The Company concluded that the offering price of the disposal assets was an approximate fair value, which exceeded the carrying value of the related assets as of May 25, 2024. As such, the assets held for sale are reported at their carrying value.The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets that were classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):Assets Held for SaleAs ofIrvine Office BuildingMay 25, 2024Building and land$14,309 Leasehold improvements321 Furniture and fixtures 1,565    Total assets held for sale, gross16,195 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization(7,286)   Total assets held for sale, net$8,909 The Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated May 15, 2024, and as amended and restated as of May 20, 2024, with a third-party buyer for the sale of its Irvine building. In August 2024, the Company completed the sale for total consideration of $13.0 million, resulting in a net gain of $3.4 million. The sale does not constitute a discontinued operation. As such, the gain has been recorded as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended May 31, 2025.5. Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAs described in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter, unless indicators of impairment exist, the Company will perform interim quantitative goodwill impairment analysis more frequently. As a result of impairment indicators related to business performance and decline in share price throughout the fiscal year, the Company performed four interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessments for its reporting units, each of which is also a reporting segment, and recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $194.4 million for fiscal 2025. During the year ended May 25, 2024, the Company performed an annual goodwill impairment on its reporting units and elected to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. As a result of the quantitative impairment test performed on February 25, 2024, the Company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. There were no changes in facts, circumstances or events from February 25, 2024 through May 25, 2024, the end of the fiscal year, that would give rise to modifying the conclusion regarding goodwill impairment assessment or require further testing, During the year ended May 27, 2023, the Company completed an interim goodwill impairment analysis in the third fiscal quarter for Sitrick, which is included in Other Segments. Many of Sitrick’s target clients were impacted by the 69Table of Contentsinitial closures of U.S. courts during the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued lingering impact on the court system despite the reopening, resulting in less opportunities and a slower revenue conversion typically provided by Sitrick. The Company determined that the carrying value of Sitrick, also a reporting unit, was in excess of its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.0 million. This impairment reduced the goodwill within the Other Segments to zero as of May 27, 2023. The Company’s determination of the estimated fair value may be based on the market-based approach, the income-based approach or a combination of both approaches. The market-based approach was based on the guideline public company method, which uses market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for a group of comparable public companies. The income-based approach was based on the present value of discounted cash flows of each reporting unit, using the Company’s assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, forecasted gross profit margins, forecasted earnings and free cash flows, terminal period growth rates, and other economic and market trends. Additionally, the present value was based on applying a weighted average cost of capital, which considered long-term interest rates and cost of equity based on the reporting segment’s risk profile. As part of the goodwill impairment test, the Company reconciled the aggregated estimated fair value of the Company's operating segments to the Company’s market capitalization, including consideration of any asymmetry in information, and control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company.Fourth Quarter 2025 Interim Impairment AssessmentsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, and subsequent to the Company's annual impairment test date, a decrease in market capitalization and slow business recovery in the Consulting segment triggered a goodwill impairment assessment. Using a combination of income-based and market-based approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units with associated goodwill, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Consulting segment exceeded its fair value by $58.8 million. In addition to recording this excess as a goodwill impairment charge, the Company also recorded a $10.2 million charge related to the deferred tax impacts from the excess carrying value. The Company therefore recorded an aggregate of $69.0 million in goodwill impairment charges for the Consulting segment.Third Quarter 2025 Interim Impairment AssessmentsDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2025, slow business recovery in the On-Demand Talent and Consulting segments triggered a goodwill impairment assessment. Using a combination of income-based and market-based approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units with associated goodwill, the Company determined that the carrying values of On-Demand Talent and Consulting segments exceeded their fair values. As a result, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $42.0 million was recorded, comprised of excess in carrying value over fair value of $12.4 million for On-Demand Talent and $24.8 million for Consulting, as well as a $4.8 million related to deferred tax impacts from the charge recorded in the Consulting segment.Second Quarter 2025 Interim Impairment AssessmentsDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease in market capitalization and slower-than-expected recovery in the On-Demand Talent and Europe and Asia Pacific segments triggered a goodwill impairment assessment. Using a combination of income-based and market-based approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units with goodwill, the Company determined that the carrying values of On-Demand Talent and Europe and Asia Pacific segments exceeded their fair values. As a result, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $79.5 million was recorded, comprised of the excess in carrying value over fair value of $48.4 million for On-Demand Talent and $21.7 million for Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as $9.3 million related to deferred tax impacts from the charges recorded in the On-Demand Talent segment.First Quarter 2025 Interim Impairment AssessmentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, concurrent with the change in the Company’s operating segments, which were aligned to the Company’s reporting units and reportable segments, the Company allocated goodwill to each of its reporting units under the new organizational structure on a relative fair value basis. The Company estimated the fair values of the reporting units based on the income-based approach. As a result, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.9 million was recorded for the excess in carrying value over fair value of the Europe and Asia Pacific segment.In performing the goodwill impairment assessments, the Company considers the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair values of its reporting units to be reasonable and appropriate. However, the assumptions are complex and 70Table of Contentssubjective, and additional adverse changes in a key assumption or a combination of key assumptions may significantly affect the Company’s assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment. These assumptions include, among other things, a failure to meet expected earnings or other financial plans; changes in the discount rate, the terminal growth rate or tax rates; or significant changes in industry or economic trends. If the assumptions noted above adversely change, negative macroeconomic conditions worsen or the Company’s market capitalization decreases for a sustained period of time, the Company may be required to perform an additional impairment analysis that could result in additional impairment charges and materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill balance. The balance as of May 25, 2024 was recast to reflect the impact of the Company's change in segment reporting and the final fair value allocation of the reporting units that became effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (in thousands):  On-Demand Talent Consulting Europe & Asia PacificOutsourced Services All Other TotalBalance as of May 27, 2023$70,202 $82,115 $25,648 $28,757 $- $206,722 Acquisition (see Note 3)- 9,637 - - - 9,637 Impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes- 18 202 - - 220 Balance as of May 25, 2024$70,202 $91,770 $25,850 $28,757 $- $216,579 Acquisition (see Note 3)- 6,855 - - - 6,855 Goodwill Impairment(70,202)(98,625)(25,582)- - (194,409)Impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes- - (268)- - (268)Balance as of May 31, 2025$- $- $- $28,757 $- $28,757 The following table presents details of the Company’s intangible assets, estimated lives and related accumulated amortization (in thousands, except for estimated useful life): As of May 31, 2025As of May 25, 2024Estimated UsefulLifeGrossAccumulatedAmortizationNetCarryingAmountGrossAccumulatedAmortizationNetCarryingAmountCustomer contracts and relationships7 - 12 years$39,500 $(21,160)$18,340 $25,100 $(16,858)$8,242 Computer software3 - 3.5 years- - - 7,870 (6,539)1,331 Trade names1 year600 (550)50 - - - Non-Compete Agreements5 years720 (132)588 - - - Total$40,820 $(21,842)$18,978 $32,970 $(23,397)$9,573 The remaining weighted-average useful life of all of the Company’s intangible assets is approximately 4.7 years.71Table of ContentsFor the year ended May 31, 2025, the Company determined that the computer software component of its intangible assets no longer provides future economic benefit and recorded a $0.4 million charge to write-off the unamortized asset.

Prior to the sale of the company-owned building located in Irvine, California to independent third parties, as described in Note 4 – Assets Held for Sale, the Company, as lessor, had operating lease agreements for office space with independent third parties for which it received rental income during the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 totaling $8,000, $142,000 and $195,000, respectively. The terms of those operating lease agreements were terminated upon the sale of the building.8. Long-Term DebtPrior to July 2, 2025, the Company had a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, pursuant to the terms of the credit Agreement dated November 12, 2021 by the Company and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders (the “2021 Credit Facility”). The 2021 Credit Facility provided for a $175.0 million senior secured revolving loan, which included a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a swingline sublimit of $20.0 million. The 2021 Credit Facility also included an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to the terms of the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2021 Credit Facility was originally set to mature on November 12, 2026; however it was terminated on July 2, 2025 in connection with a new credit agreement entered into between the Company, and Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the 73Table of ContentsCompany’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, with the lenders that are party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders (the “New Credit Facility”). See Note 19 - Subsequent Events for further discussion.The obligations under the 2021 Credit Facility were secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries. On December 31, 2024 and March 28, 2025, the parties then entered into amendments to the 2021 Credit Agreement (collectively, the “Fiscal 2025 Amendments”) to waive the Company's non-compliance with a financial covenant related to the consolidated interest coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement due to the goodwill impairment recognized during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2025, respectively. The Fiscal 2025 Amendments also amended certain definitions under the Credit Agreement to exclude the impact of goodwill impairments recognized in the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2025. As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, the Company had no debt outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $1.0 million and $1.4 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2021 Credit Facility as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively. As of May 31, 2025, there was $174.0 million of remaining capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility. On November 2, 2022, Resources Global Enterprise Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a RMB 13.4 million (USD $1.8 million based on the prevailing exchange rate on November 2, 2022) revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (Beijing) as the lender (the “Beijing Revolver”). The Beijing Revolver bears interest at loan prime rate plus 0.80%. Interest incurred on borrowings will be payable monthly in arrears. As of May 31, 2025, the Company had no debt outstanding under the Beijing Revolver and RMB 13.4 million ($1.9 million based on the prevailing exchange rate on May 31, 2025) in available credit. The availability of proceeds under the Beijing Revolver is at the lender's absolute discretion and may be terminated at any time by the lender, with or without prior notice to the borrower.9.

Given the current economic outlook, management believes there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient evidence may become available to allow it to reach a conclusion to establish or release a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign entities.We repatriated $2.9 million from our Japan subsidiary during the year ended May 31, 2025. Remaining unremitted earnings as of May 31, 2025 in our Japan subsidiary are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our Japan subsidiary's operations and growth. Going forward, the indefinite reversal criteria will apply only to the portion of our Japan subsidiary’s unremitted earnings that are needed for its ongoing operations and growth. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of approximately $30.4 million from the Company's foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2025 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. If the earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries were to be distributed, management estimates that the income tax impact would be immaterial as a result of the transition tax and federal dividends received deduction for foreign source earnings provided under the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.The following table summarizes the activity related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands): For the Years Ended May 31,2025May 25,2024May 27,2023Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year$1,033 $962 $908 Gross increases-tax positions in prior period82 71 54 Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year$1,115 $1,033 $962 The Company’s total liability for unrecognized gross tax benefits was $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million as of May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively, which, if ultimately recognized, any differences in assessment or non-assessment would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The unrecognized tax benefits are 77Table of Contentsincluded in long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are short-term liabilities as management does not anticipate any cash payments within 12 months to settle the liability. The Company’s major income tax jurisdiction is the U.S., with federal statutes of limitations remaining open for fiscal 2020 and thereafter. For states within the U.S. in which the Company does significant business, the Company remains subject to examination for fiscal 2020 and thereafter. Most major foreign jurisdictions remain open for fiscal years ended 2020 and thereafter.The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for income taxes. During the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, the Company accrued interest of $82,000, $71,000 and $54,000, respectively, as a component of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company's cumulative accrued interest was $267,000, $185,000 and $114,000 as of May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively.10.

Concentrations of Credit RiskThe Company currently maintains cash and cash equivalents in commercial paper or money market accounts. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of trade receivables. However, concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Company’s client base and their dispersion across different business and geographic areas. The Company monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains an allowance for anticipated losses. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one or more of the Company’s clients could result in an increase in the allowance for anticipated losses. No single client accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023. No single client accounted for more than 10% of trade accounts receivable as of May 31, 2025, or May 25, 2024.12. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramThe Company’s Board of Directors has previously approved two stock repurchase programs authorizing the repurchase, at the discretion of the Company’s senior executives, of the Company’s common stock for a designated aggregate dollar limit. In July 2015, the first program was authorized for an aggregate dollar limit not to exceed $150 million, and in October 2024, the second program was authorized for an additional dollar limit not to exceed $50 million (collectively, the “Stock Repurchase Programs”). Subject to the aggregate dollar limits, the currently authorized Stock Repurchase Programs do not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the programs may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. During the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively, the Company purchased 1,382,820 and 606,254 shares of its common stock on the open market at an average price of $9.40 and $13.20 per share, for an aggregate total purchase price of approximately $13.0 million and $8.0 million. As of May 31, 2025, approximately $79.2 million remained available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the Stock Repurchase Programs.78Table of ContentsQuarterly DividendSubject to approval each quarter by its Board of Directors, the Company pays a regular dividend. On April 29, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend was paid on July 21, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 23, 2025. As of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, approximately $2.3 million and $4.7 million was accrued and recorded in other current liabilities in each of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for dividends declared but not yet paid. Continuation of the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business condition, contractual restrictions contained in the Company’s current credit agreements and other agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.13. Revenue RecognitionThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections affects the recognition of accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities. Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration for completed performance under the contract (e.g., unbilled receivables), in which the Company has transferred control of the product or services before there is an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets were $30.7 million, $29.3 million, and $35.4 million as of May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024, and May 27, 2023, respectively, which were included in trade accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities represent deferred revenue when cash is received in advance of performance and are presented in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities were $4.3 million, $3.5 million, and $3.1 million as of May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024, and May 27, 2023, respectively. Revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2025 that were included in deferred revenues as of May 25, 2024 were $1.9 million. Revenues recognized during the year ended May 25, 2024 that were included in deferred revenues as of May 27, 2023 were $2.5 million. Revenues recognized during the year ended May 27, 2023 that were included in deferred revenues as of May 28, 2022 were $3.0 million.14. Restructuring ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2024, the Company initiated a cost reduction plan, including a reduction in force (the “U.S. Restructuring Plan”) intended to reduce costs and streamline operations, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 12% of the Company’s U.S. management and administrative workforce. The Company incurred employee termination costs of $4.1 million associated with the U.S. Restructuring Plan within its RGP segment during the year ended May 25, 2024, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The U.S. Restructuring Plan was substantially completed during the year ended May 25, 2024. The Restructuring adjustments and costs of $(0.4) million for the year ended May 27, 2023 related to restructuring efforts in previous fiscal years.In December, 2024, the Company authorized a global cost reduction plan, including a reduction in force (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”) intended to reduce costs and streamline operations. In May 2025, the Company authorized additional global cost reductions. The 2025 Restructuring Plan resulted in a reduction of force of the Company’s global management and administrative workforce. The Company incurred employee termination costs associated with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Restructuring costs were $5.1 million for the year ended May 31, 2025.The restructuring liability was nominal and $0.8 million as of May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024, respectively.15. Stock-Based Compensation PlansGeneralThe Company’s stockholders approved the 2020 Plan on October 22, 2020, which replaced and succeeded in its entirety the 2014 Plan. On October 17, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2020 Plan, which increased the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan by 815,000 shares. Executive officers and certain employees, as well as non-employee directors of the Company and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2020 Plan equals: (1) 815,000 shares, plus (2) 1,797,440 (which represents the number of shares that were available for additional award grant 79Table of Contentspurposes under the 2014 Plan immediately prior to the termination of the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan as of October 22, 2020), plus (3) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan or the Resources Connection, Inc. 2004 Performance Incentive Plan (together with the 2014 Plan, the “Prior Plans”) and outstanding as of October 22, 2020 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised, plus (4) the number of any shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the Prior Plans that are outstanding and unvested as of October 22, 2020 which are forfeited, terminated, cancelled, or otherwise reacquired after that date without having become vested. Awards under the 2020 Plan may include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in shares of common stock or units of common stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards. Historically, the Company has granted restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards under the 2020 Plan that typically vest in equal annual installments, and performance stock unit awards under the 2020 Plan that vest upon the achievement of certain Company-wide performance targets at the end of the defined performance period. Stock option grants typically terminate ten years from the date of grant. Vesting periods for restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards range from three years to four years. The performance period for the performance stock unit awards is three years. As of May 31, 2025, there were 1,308,213 shares available for further award grants under the 2020 Plan.Stock-Based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $6.8 million, $5.7 million and $9.5 million for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively. These amounts consisted of stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards under the 2020 Plan and Prior Plans, employee stock purchases made via the ESPP, and stock units credited under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.6 million, $1.1 million, and $2.0 million, associated with such stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024, and May 27, 2023, respectively.The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on time-vesting equity awards ratably over the applicable vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures. Expense related to the liability-classified awards reflects the change in fair value during the reporting period. The number of performance stock units earned at the end of the performance period may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. During each reporting period, the Company uses the latest forecasted results to estimate the number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period. Any resulting changes to stock compensation expense are adjusted in the period in which the change in estimates occur.Stock Options The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the year ended May 31, 2025 (in thousands, except weighted average exercise price): Number ofSharesUnderOptionWeightedAverageExercisePriceWeighted AverageRemainingContractual Life(in years)Aggregate IntrinsicValueAwards outstanding at May 25, 20242,185$16.363.21$- Exercised- - Forfeited- - Expired(658)15.29Awards outstanding at May 31, 20251,527$16.892.62$- Exercisable at May 31, 20251,527$16.892.62$- Vested and expected to vest as of May 31, 2025 (1)1,527$16.892.62$- (1)The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to options not yet vested.

The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 was $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. There were no stock options exercised during the year ended May 31, 2025.As of May 31, 2025, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested and outstanding employee stock options. Valuation and Expense Information for Stock Based Compensation PlansThere were no employee stock options granted during the years ended May 31, 2025 and May 25, 2024. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On October 20, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ESPP that increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP by 1,500,000, resulting in a maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP of 3,325,000 shares.The Company’s ESPP allows qualified employees (as defined in the ESPP) to purchase designated shares of the Company’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of common stock at the beginning or end of each semi-annual stock purchase period. The Company issued 492,858, 455,678 and 393,060 shares of common stock pursuant to the ESPP for the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively. There were 830,388 shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP as of May 31, 2025.Restricted Stock AwardsThe following table summarizes the activities for the unvested restricted stock awards for the year ended May 31, 2025 (in thousands, except weighted average grant-date fair value): SharesWeighted-Average

The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.56 years. The weighted average estimated fair value per share of restricted stock awards granted during the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023 was $8.91, $13.79 and $18.31, respectively.Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)In 2018, the Company adopted the amended and restated Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides the non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer certain cash compensation and equity awards earned or granted for their service in the form of stock units (“Stock Units”). The Stock Units are used solely as a device for determining the amount of cash eventually paid to the director. Each Stock Unit has the same value as one share of the Company’s common stock. Stock Units are not paid out until the director leaves the Board of Directors, at which time the cash value of the Stock Units is paid out in accordance with terms of the plan and the director’s election. Additional Stock Units are credited to reflect dividends paid on shares of the Company’s common stock. Stock Units credited to a director pursuant to an election to defer cash compensation (and any dividend equivalents credited thereon) are fully vested at all times. Stock Units credited to a director pursuant to an election to defer an equity award are subject to the vesting conditions applicable to the equity award, except that dividend equivalents credited to a director with respect to 81Table of Contentssuch Stock Units are vested at all times. These liability-classified awards are re-measured at each reporting date and on settlement using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date. Any change in fair value is recorded as stock-based compensation expense in the period. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on these Stock Units using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.The Company also grants RSUs to its employees under the 2020 Plan, which are classified as equity awards. The following table summarizes the activities for the unvested RSUs, including both equity- and liability-classified RSUs, for the year ended May 31, 2025 (in thousands, except weighted average grant-date fair value):Equity-Classified RSUsLiability-Classified RSUsTotal RSUsSharesWeighted-Average Grant-Date Fair ValueSharesWeighted-Average Grant-Date Fair ValueSharesWeighted-Average Grant-Date Fair ValueUnvested at May 25, 2024615$14.91 48$15.64 663$14.96 Granted (1)1,0819.95 458.68 1,1269.90 Vested(263)14.45 (30)12.93 (293)14.29 Forfeited(110)12.95 -- (110)12.95 Unvested as of May 31, 20251,323$11.16 63$11.95 1,386$11.20 Expected to vest as of May 31, 20251,120$11.17 63$11.95 1,183$11.21 (1)The dividend equivalents are included in the granted shares.As of May 31, 2025, there was $8.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs (which are the RSUs granted under the 2020 Plan that settle in shares of the Company’s common stock). The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.13 years.As of May 31, 2025, there was $0.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested liability-classified RSUs (which are the stock units credited under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan that settle in cash).

The total number of shares that will vest under the PSUs will be determined at the end of a three-year performance period based on the Company’s achievement of certain revenue and Adjusted EBITDA percentage targets over the performance period. The total number of shares that may be earned for these awards based on performance over the performance period ranges from zero to 150% of the target number of shares.The following table summarizes the activities for the unvested PSUs for the year ended May 31, 2025 (in thousands, except weighted average grant-date fair value):Shares (1)Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair ValueUnvested at May 25, 2024621$16.15 Granted (2)3669.12 Vested(164)18.41 Forfeited(125)13.65 Unvested as of May 31, 2025698$12.60 Expected to vest as of May 31, 2025507$10.85 (1)Shares are presented at the stated target, which represents the base number of shares that would vest.

Benefit PlanThe Company maintains the Resources Global Professionals 401(k) Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) which generally covers all employees in the U.S. who have completed three months of service. Participants may contribute up to 75% of their annual salary, up to the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. Pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan, the Company may make discretionary matching contributions. The Company, at its sole discretion, determines the matching contribution made at each pay period. For the years ended May 31, 2025, May 25, 2024 and May 27, 2023, the Company contributed $3.1 million, $7.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively, to the 401(k) Plan as Company matching contributions.17. Commitments and ContingenciesLegal ProceedingsThe Company is involved in certain legal matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, all such matters, if disposed of unfavorably, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.18. Segment Information and Enterprise ReportingDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company reorganized its business segments to better align with changes in its internal operating model and financial reporting, which is used for performance assessment and resource allocation by the CODMs. All prior year periods presented were recast to reflect the impact of the preceding segment changes. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion about the Company’s operating and reportable segments.The tables below reflect the operating results of the Company’s segments consistent with the management and performance measurement system utilized by the Company. Performance measurement is based on segment Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before amortization expense, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortized Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system costs, technology transformation costs, goodwill impairment, acquisition costs, gain on sale of assets, and restructuring costs. Adjusted EBITDA at the segment level excludes certain shared corporate administrative costs that are not practical to allocate. The Company’s CODMs do not evaluate segments using asset information.The table below represents a reconciliation of the Company’s net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented (in thousands): 83Table of ContentsFor the Years EndedMay 31,2025May 25,2024May 27,2023Revenue:On-Demand Talent$205,976 $272,600 $372,679 Consulting219,215 227,967 259,946 Europe & Asia Pacific77,602 84,207 93,166 Outsourced Services39,618 38,122 38,950 All Other8,920 9,905 10,902 Total consolidated revenue$551,331 $632,801 $775,643 Adjusted EBITDA:On-Demand Talent$17,116 $31,673 $60,484 Consulting31,718 38,420 53,477 Europe & Asia Pacific4,478 5,289 9,913 Outsourced Services7,581 7,641 7,408 All Other(1,838)(675)1,131 Unallocated items (1)(35,598)(30,865)(32,219)Adjustments:Stock-based compensation expense(6,754)(5,732)(9,521)Amortized ERP system costs (2)(1,287)- - Technology transformation costs (3)(5,474)(6,901)(6,355)Acquisition costs (4)(2,763)(1,970)- Goodwill impairment (5)(194,409)- (2,955)Gain on sale of assets (6)3,420 - - Restructuring cost (7)(5,061)(4,087)364 Amortization expense(5,880)(5,378)(5,018)Depreciation expense(1,868)(3,050)(3,539)Contingent consideration adjustment (8)- 4,400 - Interest income, net544 1,064 (552)Income (loss) before income tax benefit (expense)(196,075)29,829 72,618 Income tax benefit (expense)4,295(8,795)(18,259)Net income (loss)$(191,780)$21,034 $54,359 (1)Unallocated items are generally comprised of unallocated corporate administrative costs, including management and board compensation, corporate support function costs and other general corporate costs that are not allocated to segments.(2)Amortized ERP system costs represent the amortization of capitalized technology transformation costs related to newly implemented ERP system, which was recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.(3)Technology transformation costs represent costs included in net income (loss) related to the Company’s initiative to upgrade its technology platform globally, including a cloud-based ERP system and talent acquisition and management systems.

Subsequent EventsOn July 2, 2025, the Company, Resources Connection LLC, as borrowers, and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the
New Credit Facility, and concurrently terminated the 2021 Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility provides for a secured revolving loan, available in an amount up to the lesser of $50.0 million and a borrowing base formula tied to eligible receivables, which includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The New Credit Facility also includes an option to increase the amount of the revolving loan up to an additional $15.0 million. The New Credit Facility will mature on November 30, 2029. The obligations under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company, Resources Connection LLC and all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.Borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum of either, at the Company's election (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, in either case, with the applicable margin depending on the Company's Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the New Credit Facility). The Company is also obligated to pay other customary facility fees for a credit facility of this size and type.The New Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets and financial covenants to maintain a certain consolidated total net leverage ratio and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility, the lender may cease making loans, terminate the New Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The New Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults.On July 4, 2025, One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. Among other changes, OBBBA makes permanent several expiring provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, restores favorable tax treatment of various business provisions, and modifies the international tax regime. These changes were not reflected in the income tax provision for fiscal 2025, as enactment occurred after the balance sheet date.

We maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included an assessment of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2025.The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP, which audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, as stated in their report which is included in this Item 9A under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.88Table of ContentsITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION.Insider Trading ArrangementsNone.ITEM 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS.Not applicable.PART IIIITEM 10.    DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
