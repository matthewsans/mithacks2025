The current management team lead an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed in 2010 and thereafter changed the Company’s name to MMEX Resources Corporation.  MMEX is focused on the development, financing, construction, and operation of clean fuels infrastructure projects powered by renewable energy. MMEX has formed special purpose limited liability companies to implement its planned projects. Pecos Clean Fuels & Transport, LLC The Company has teamed with Polaris Engineering to develop an ultra-clean transportation fuels refinery, up to 11,600 barrel per day federate crude oil refining facility at our Pecos County, Texas site. The planned product slate will consist of transportation grade finished products, including zero sulfur 87° gasoline, ultra-low sulfur diesel and low-sulfur fuel oil. In addition, to finished products, the Ultra Fuel® configuration has expected criteria pollutant emissions that are on the order of 95% lower than those of a traditional refinery in the US Gulf Coast. A companion project planned by MMEX, is a Blue Hydrogen project, converting natural gas to hydrogen to produce power and if implemented will provide the refinery with hydrogen for fuel gas and thus eliminate CO2 emissions. The Ultra Fuels® configuration, with capex and technical details completed in the Front-End Load-2 (“FEL-2”) engineering package, features modular design features to take advantage of proximity to Permian Basin fuel markets and to locate directly near crude oil production areas near the Company’s owned 126-acre site. Because equipment is fabricated in modular units and shipped to site, this allows for an 18-month project completion time-frame and more rapid implementation. The modular concept with reduced footprint, as well as lower emissions, also allowed for faster permitting which we obtained for this facility from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality on February 18, 2022.  3Table of Contents Trans Permian H2Hub, LLC The Company is in planning discussions with a super major oil company (the “Super Major”) to utilize its natural gas in the Permian Basin to develop a Natural Gas to Power Project at the Company’s Pecos County, Texas site. The Project plans to utilize a portion of the Super Major’s significant natural gas production and transportation from the Permian in gas turbines and generators in a combined cycle configuration to produce electric power with 100% natural gas in Phase 1. In Phase 2 we plan to convert the natural gas into hydrogen utilizing a major international company’s reformer technology, with the existing gas turbines modified to utilize initially 75% hydrogen and 25% natural gas to generate electric power. The produced electric power in both Phases may be dispatched to a data center or dispatched to ERCOT Far West, the Texas power regional pricing and trading hub, or both. The project design also includes a CO2 capture and production facility with the CO2 marketed to another Super Major oil company. The Project plans to utilize wind and solar power as its source of energy. Additionally, the Project plans to utilize its hydrogen production as fuel gas for the Pecos Clean Fuels & Transport refinery project, and this fuel gas will generate zero CO2 emissions from the refinery. Completion of these projects is dependent upon our obtaining the necessary capital for planning, construction and start-up costs. There is no assurance that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms. Regulation Our Pecos Clean Fuels project already has a construction permit from the TCEQ and does not require an operation permit. Although we do not believe our planned natural gas and hydrogen power projects will have any significant environmental or ecological impact, we will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations relating to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the soil, groundwater, and surface water, and measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. There are risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations.  We expect to file with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) construction and operation permits for the Trans Permian Projects. We expect to employ carbon capture with the blue hydrogen in Phase 2 and have under discussion with a super major oil company the sequestration of the CO2 for EOR, which already has the requisite permits.  Our planned operations may also be subject to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities, and to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. If applicable, we will have to have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements, and we will need to develop a Facility Security Plan as required under the relevant law. We will also have to have in place procedures to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of all our facilities. Our planned operations will also be subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We may also become subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We will take measures to ensure that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.  4Table of Contents Employees  As of April 30, 2025, we had no employees but rather to reduce costs our key management team is working under consulting agreements. We contract for all professional services when needed. Legal Proceedings See Item 3 of this Report.  Item 1A: Risk Factors As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 1C: Cybersecurity Because the Company has not yet commenced revenue producing activities, cybersecurity threats have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to affect, the Company.  Accordingly, the Company has not yet implemented any cybersecurity plans or made any evaluation of potential cybersecurity threats.  The occurrence of cyber-incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity or in those of any of our third-party service providers could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information and systems, or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s third-party vendors’ and service providers’ cybersecurity risk management processes, including their policies, controls or procedures, will be effective in protecting the Company’s systems and information. Item 2: Properties Our office address for mailing purposes is 3616 Far West Blvd. #117-321, Austin, Texas 78731. Our executive physical office is located at 3600 Dickinson, Fort Stockton, Texas, 79735 near the sites of our proposed clean fuels and hydrogen projects. We own a total of approximately 1,081.45 acres in Pecos County, Texas that are the sites for our planned clean fuels and hydrogen projects. Item 3: Legal Proceedings Sabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund, Ltd. (“Sabby”) commenced litigation against us in a New York State Court, alleging the Company’s breach of contract, fraud, and failure to maintain and deliver shares under the convertible note previously issued by the Company to Sabby. Sabby also holds the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock and substantial warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock. During September 2023, the court granted Sabby’s request for an order (i) granting specific performance of Sabby’s past and future requests for conversion, (ii) enjoining the Company from issuing shares of its Common Stock until it has complied with the order and (iii) directing the Company’s transfer agent to take all actions necessary to enforce the order, including reserving shares issuable upon Sabby’s conversion of its outstanding note payable. Sabby subsequently sought and obtained a default order of contempt, entered on October 20, 2023, which among other matters cited the Company’s failure to transfer shares without restriction and to reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to honor Sabby’s potential conversions of its convertible note, Series B Preferred Stock and warrants. Upon the Company’s motion to vacate the contempt order, the court vacated the contempt order on December 5, 2023.On May 6, 2024, Sabby filed for an order of contempt against the Company for not complying with the Court’s Order issued September 13, 2023. The Company agreed in a Stipulation Resolving Motion for Contempt filed on June 10, 2024 with Sabby to increase its authorized shares reserves to 35 billion shares and to place into reserves for Sabby conversions, 10 billion shares. On July 17, 2024, the Parties agreed to a Stipulation withdrawing the Motion for Contempt. The litigation has entered the discovery phase pursuant to the court’s orders. Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable.  5Table of Contents PART II Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Since April 10, 2018, our common stock has been listed on the OTC Pink, now known as the Pink Open Market under the symbol "MMEX". The OTC Market is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information on current “bids” and “asks”, as well as volume information. From November 2, 2017 through April 9, 2018, our Class A common stock was listed on the OTCQB and prior to November 2, 2017, our Class A common stock was quoted on the Pink Open Market tier. The following table indicates the quarterly high and low bid price for our common stock for the fiscal years ending April 30, 2025 and 2024.

This number does not include an undetermined number of stockholders whose stock is held in "street" or "nominee" name. We have not declared or paid any cash or other dividends on our common stock to date for the last two (2) fiscal years and have no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future. We did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities not previously reported in the Company's Form 10-Q On May 14, 2025 the Company issued 125,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for consulting services. On July 10, 2025 the Company issued 250,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for consulting services.  6Table of Contents Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Plan Category Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights (a)  Weighted Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights  Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (excluding securities in Column (a)           Equity Compensation Plans Approved by Security Holders  0   0   0 Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Security Holders  1,302,729  $0.000144   0 Total  1,302,729  $0.000144   0  Penny Stock Our stock is considered to be a penny stock. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities. Item 6: [Reserved] Not applicable   7Table of Contents Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in this Annual Report. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis constitutes forward-looking statements for purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and as such involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The words “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “predict”, “believes”, “plan”, “seek”, “objective” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or elsewhere in this report. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially from our expectations are discussed in detail in Item 1 above. All written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not entitled to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements under 27A of the Securities Act or 21E of the Exchange Act as long as our stock is classified as a penny stock within the meaning of Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. A penny stock is generally defined to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined in Rule 3a51-1) of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto. Overview Business Overview Since 2016, the focus of our business has been to build crude oil distillation units and refining facilities (CDUs) in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We revised our business plan in 2021 to move MMEX to clean energy production, leveraging our history, management and business relationships from the traditional energy sector. Since 2021 MMEX has expanded its focus to the development, financing, construction and operation of clean fuels infrastructure projects powered by renewable energy. We have formed three special purpose entities of the Company - one to transition from legacy refining transportation fuels by producing them as ultra clean fuels with carbon capture, a second which plans to produce electric power from natural gas in Phase 1 and to implement in Phase 2 utilization of the natural gas to produce hydrogen and power. The planned projects are designed to be powered by solar and wind renewable energy. We continue to review implementation of our clean fuels technology internationally. Through April 30, 2025, we have had no revenues and have reported continuing losses from operations. Results of Operations We recorded a net loss of $2,299,458 or $(0.0002) per share, for fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, compared to a net loss of $8,194,086 or $(0.0011) per share, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. As discussed below, the net income or loss for any fiscal year fluctuates materially due to non-operating gains and losses. Revenues We have not yet begun to generate revenues.  8Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses increased $139,580 to $1,395,748 for the year ended April 30, 2025 from $1,256,168 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The increase resulted from a combination of higher consultant fee costs offset by lower legal fees.. Project Costs Our project costs decreased $6,421 to $5,430 for the year ended April 30, 2025 from $11,851 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The levels of spending on our projects will vary from period to period based on availability of financing and will be expensed as project costs are incurred. During the year ended April 30, 2025, the decrease in project costs was because we did not have funding available to invest in our projects during the current year. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Our depreciation and amortization expenses were unchanged at $36,394 for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 respectively. The expense results from the depreciation of land improvements and amortization of land easements. Other Income (Expense) Our interest expense increased $120,898 to $461,672 for the year ended April 30, 2025 from $340,774 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The increase is attributed to new debt agreements and debt issued with debt discounts being amortized to interest expense during the year ended April 30, 2025. We reported a loss on extinguishment of debt of $400,214 for the year ended April 30, 2025 compared to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $819,346 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The gain/loss on extinguishment of debt generally results from the settlement and extinguishment of convertible notes payable and certain accounts payable and accrued expenses and can fluctuate over time as we are able to settle or pay off debt. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the above, we reported net losses of $2,299,458 and $2,464,533 for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Deemed Dividend During the year ended April 30, 2024 the conversion price of our Series B preferred stock was reduced from $0.05 to $0.000058 per share, which resulted in the recognition of a deemed dividend of $5,729,553 during the year ended April 30, 2024 in order to account for the change in fair value of the Series B preferred stock. During the year ended April 30, 2025 the conversion price of our Series B preferred stock remained at $0.000058, therefore no deemed dividend was recorded for the year ended April 30, 2025. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders As a result of the deemed dividend, our net loss attributed to common shareholders was $2,299,458 and $8,194,086 for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital As of April 30, 2025, we had current assets of $8,079, comprised of cash of $4,579 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3,500, and current liabilities of $4,795,043, resulting in a working capital deficit of $4,786,964.  9Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash Our sources and uses of cash for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:   2025  2024        Cash, Beginning of Year $898  $10,363 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  (380,107 )  (492,992 )Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  -   - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  383,788   483,527          Cash, End of Year $4,579  $898  We used net cash of $380,107 in operating activities for the year ended April 30, 2025 as a result of our net loss of $2,299,458, our non-cash losses of $400,214, our increase in accounts payable of $212,287, and our increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related parties of $757,331, our increase in accrued expenses of $247,058, our increase in non-cash expenses totaling $302,961 and our decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $500. In comparison, we used net cash of $492,992 in operating activities for the year ended April 30, 2024 as a result of our net loss of $2,464,533, our non-cash losses of $819,346, our increase in accounts payable of $107,745, and our increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related parties of $769,583, our increase in accrued expenses of $66,914, our increase in non-cash expenses totaling $186,953 and our decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $21,000. We had no cash used in investing activities for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $383,788 for the year ended April 30, 2025, comprised of proceeds from notes payable – related parties of $429,776 and proceeds from convertible notes payable – related parties of $1,300 partially offset by repayments of notes payable of $15,728 and repayments of notes payable – related parties of $31,560. By comparison, net cash provided by financing activities was $483,527 for the year ended April 30, 2024, comprised of proceeds from notes payable of $395,000, proceeds from notes payable – related parties of $108,200, proceeds from convertible notes payable of $110,00 and proceeds from convertible notes payable – related parties of $50,000 partially offset by repayments of convertible notes payable of $158,790, repayments of notes payable of $13,685 and repayments of notes payable – related parties of $7,198. Going Concern Uncertainty Our financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations, have an accumulated deficit of $83,220,849 and a total stockholders’ deficit of $5,982,885 at April 30, 2025, and have reported negative cash flows from operations since inception. In addition, as of April 30, 2025 we did not have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments for the next twelve months. We require capital investments to implement our business plan, including the development of our planned hydrogen projects. Additionally, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established markets and the competitive environment in which we operate. We expect to continue to seek additional funding through private or public equity and debt financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs and/or to raise funds to finance ongoing operations and repay debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that our cash generated by our operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  10Table of Contents The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies Our results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  For further information on our significant accounting policies see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. There were no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the year ended April 30, 2025 and there are no policies we deem to be critical accounting policies. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The following financial statements are being filed with this report and are located immediately following the signature page. Index to Consolidated Financial StatementsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmConsolidated Balance Sheets as of April 30, 2025 and 2024Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There have been no changes in or disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosures.   11Table of Contents Item 9A(T): Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of April 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, based on the COSO framework criteria. Management believes our processes and controls are sufficient to ensure the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K were fairly stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has made changes to the Company's internal control over financial reporting through the date of this report and/or through the quarter ended April 30, 2025, that materially affected the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management increased its accounting personnel and made numerous changes to its accounting processes which resulted in a segregation of duties and the implementation of reviews and monitoring activities which have added controls into the accounting processes and improved our financial reporting. Additionally, management established a formal written policy for the approval, identification, and authorization of related party transactions. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Independent Registered Accountant's Internal Control Attestation This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

Mr. Hanks graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a law degree in 1971 and a petroleum land management degree in 1968.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended April 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring net losses, working capital deficit, and stockholders’ deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  F-2Table of Contents  Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Going Concern  Due to the net loss, negative cash flows from operations for the year, and working capital deficiency, the Company evaluated the need for a going concern listed in note 3.  Auditing management’s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses, which are not able to be easily substantiated.  We evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management’s plans to mitigate the going concern and management’s disclosure on going concern. /s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company’s auditor

CORPORATIONNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsYears Ended April 30, 2025 and 2024  NOTE 1 – BACKGROUND, ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION MMEX Resources Corporation (the “Company” or “MMEX”) was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team led an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed on September 23, 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation on February 11, 2011 and to MMEX Resources Corporation on April 6, 2016. Since 2021 MMEX has expanded its focus to the development, financing, construction and operation of clean fuels infrastructure projects powered by renewable energy. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following entities, all of which the Company maintains control through a majority ownership or through common ownership: Name of Entity %  Form of Entity State of Incorporation Relationship            MMEX Resources Corporation (“MMEX”)  -  Corporation Nevada Parent Pecos Clean Fuels & Transport (formerly Refining & Transport, LLC)  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary Trans Permian H2Hub, LLC  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary MMEX Solar Resources, LLC  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary Hydrogen Global, LLC  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary MMEX USA Holdings, LLC  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary MMEX Argentina USA, LLC  100% LLC Texas Subsidiary  All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of April 30. NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its aforementioned subsidiaries and entities under common ownership. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The ownership interests in subsidiaries that are held by owners other than the Company are recorded as non-controlling interest and reported in our consolidated balance sheets within stockholders’ deficit. Losses attributed to the non-controlling interest and to the Company are reported separately in our consolidated statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  F-10Table of Contents  Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount, and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or legal life of the related asset as follows: Office furniture and equipment10 yearsComputer equipment and software5 yearsLand improvement15 yearsLand easements10 years The land easements owned by the Company have a legal life of 10 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations. The Company will assess the recoverability of property and equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment, if any, will be measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management. Fair value of financial instruments Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, the FASB establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes reported on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short-term nature of the instruments.  An entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value using a hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  F-11Table of Contents  Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), as amended. ASC 606 provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation. Project costs All project costs incurred, including acquisition of refinery rights, planning, design and permitting, have been recorded as project costs and expensed as incurred. Income taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions The Company has adopted FASB standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities and has not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its consolidated financial statements. The assessment of the Company's tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company's various filing positions. Basic and diluted income (loss) per share Basic net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income or loss (available to common stockholders) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income or loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, warrants, convertible debt and convertible preferred stock, were exercised or converted into common stock. As of April 30, 2025 and 2024 all potentially dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share; therefore, basic net loss per common share is the same as diluted net loss per share.  F-12Table of Contents  Stock-based compensation Pursuant to FASB ASC 718, the Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments, including grants of stock options and warrants, to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined as the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance is reached or (ii) the date at which the performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued for services to be performed over time, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the service period. For the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $0 and $28,200, respectively. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for the prior year have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve the disclosures about reportable segments and include more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. This ASU also requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment, like the Company, provide all of the disclosures required as part of the amendments and all existing disclosures required by Topic 280. The ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company has reviewed all new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB and does not believe any of the accounting pronouncements has had, or will have, a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN Our financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations, have an accumulated deficit of $83,220,849 and a total stockholders’ deficit of $5,982,885 at April 30, 2025, and have reported negative cash flows from operations since inception. While we have received debt and equity funding during the period and have cash on hand of $4,579 at April 30, 2025, we still have a working capital deficit of $4,786,964, therefore there is a question of whether or not we have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments for the next twelve months and have, or will obtain, sufficient capital investments to implement our business plan, including the development of our planned hydrogen projects. Finally, our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established and emerging markets and the competitive environment in which we operate. Since inception, our operations have primarily been funded through private debt and equity financing, and we expect to continue to seek additional funding through private or public equity and debt financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs and/or to raise funds to finance ongoing operations and repay debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that our cash generated by our operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  F-13Table of Contents NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses – Related Parties Accounts payable and accrued expenses to related parties, consisting primarily of consulting fees and expense reimbursements payable, totaled $676,878 and $1,030,523 as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Effective July 1, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”), a related party controlled by our President and CEO, that provides for payment of consulting fees and expense reimbursement related to business development, financing and other corporate activities. Effective March 1, 2021 the Maple Resources consulting agreement was amended to provide for monthly consulting fees of $20,000. During the year ended April 30, 2025, we incurred consulting fees and expense reimbursement to Maple Resources totaling $245,176 and we made repayments to Maple Resources of $139,835 and exchanged $260,491 of accrued liabilities for a convertible note payable. During the year ended April 30, 2024, we incurred consulting fees and expense reimbursement to Maple Resources totaling $260,973 and we made repayments to Maple Resources of $128,395 and converted $58,119 of accrued liabilities into 910,958,934 shares of common stock, which were valued at $273,288 based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the day of conversion, therefore a loss of $215,169 was recognized and resulting in $175,150 still owed as of April 30, 2024. In addition, the consulting agreement provides for the issuance to Maple Resources of shares of our common stock each month with a value of $5,000, with the number of shares issued based on the average closing price of the stock during the prior month.

A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. No provision for income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $24,952,862 as of April 30, 2025 that will be available to offset future taxable income.
