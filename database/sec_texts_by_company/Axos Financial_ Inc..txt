BUSINESSOverviewOur Company is a technology-driven, diversified financial services company with approximately $24.8 billion in assets and approximately $39.4 billion of assets under custody and/or administration at Axos Clearing LLC (“Axos Clearing”). Our client-centric, technology-enabled services model provides secure and scalable banking, clearing and custody, and investment advisory solutions to retail and business customers. Axos Bank (the “Bank”) provides consumer and commercial banking products and services through its digital online and mobile banking platforms, low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. Our Bank offers deposit and lending products to customers nationwide including consumer and business checking, savings and time deposit accounts and single family and multifamily residential mortgages, commercial real estate mortgages and loans, fund and lender finance loans, asset-based loans, auto loans, retail and floor plan marine loans and other consumer loans. Our Bank generates non-interest income from consumer and business products and services, including fees from loans originated for sale, deposit account service fees, prepayment fees, loan servicing fees, as well as technology and payment transaction processing fees. We offer securities products and services to independent registered investment advisors (“RIAs”) and introducing broker dealers (“IBDs”) through Axos Clearing and Axos Advisor Services (“AAS”) and direct-to-consumer securities trading and digital investment management products through Axos Invest, Inc. (“Axos Invest”). AAS and Axos Clearing generate interest and asset- and transaction-based fee income by providing comprehensive securities custody services to RIAs and clearing, stock lending, and margin lending services to IBDs respectively. Axos Invest generates fee income from self-directed securities trading and digital wealth management services. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “AX” and is a component of the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P SmallCap 600® Index, among other indices.Segment InformationWe conduct business primarily through two operating segments: the Banking Business Segment and the Securities Business Segment. For additional information on our business segments, see Note 22—“Segment Reporting” in the Consolidated Financial Statements.BANKING BUSINESS SEGMENTWe distribute our loan products through our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels. The loans we retain primarily include first mortgages secured by single family real property, multifamily real property and commercial real property, commercial & industrial loans to businesses, automobile loans and certain other consumer loans. We also invest in debt securities to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. Because risk-adjusted returns available on acquired assets may exceed returns available through retaining assets from our origination channels, we have elected to purchase loans and securities from time to time, and may continue to do so in the future. Our deposit products are sourced from a wide range of retail and commercial distribution channels, and our deposits consist of demand, savings and time deposits.Loan PortfolioSingle Family - Mortgage & WarehouseOur Single Family - Mortgage & Warehouse loans are primarily secured by first and second liens on 1-4 unit residential properties. Loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate single family residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We source single family mortgage loans through mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers, financial institutions and direct to consumer.Our adjustable rate loans have initial fixed-rate periods, generally five, seven, or ten years, before starting a variable rate period, and may also have interest rate floors, ceilings and rate change caps.We also warehouse certain loans for independent mortgage bankers to sell to investors and government agencies.1Multifamily and Commercial MortgageOur Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage loans are primarily secured by multifamily real estate or commercial real estate. Loans often include initial fixed rate periods of either three, five, or seven years before starting a variable rate period, which is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or other interest rate indices. Multifamily and commercial mortgage loans generally include prepayment protection clauses, interest floors and rate change caps. We source multifamily and commercial mortgage loans through targeted direct-to-borrower original channels and we may sell certain loans to investors.Commercial Real EstateOur Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”) loans are secured by real estate properties in a variety of structures. CRE loans include our CRE specialty loans, real estate lender finance loans, as well as other CRE loans that may be collateralized directly by real estate or indirectly by loans secured by real estate. We source our CRE loans through direct to borrower origination, brokers, and third-party lenders. Our commercial real estate loans generally have a variable rate, which is generally based on SOFR, as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors and rate change caps.Commercial & Industrial - Non-Real Estate (“non-RE”)Our commercial & industrial – non-RE loans are typically secured by commercial assets, including, but not limited to, receivables, inventory, equipment and uniform commercial code (“UCC”) all asset filings. Product types include lender finance, asset-based loans, leveraged cash flow loans, insurance premium finance, capital call facilities, equipment leases, and general working capital commercial and industrial loans. We source commercial & industrial – non-RE loans through direct-to-borrower origination and through third-party sales referrals.Our commercial & industrial – non-RE loans generally have a variable rate based on SOFR or other interest rate indices, as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors and rate change caps. Our equipment leases typically have fixed rates. For certain commercial non-real estate loan products, we typically reduce risk exposure in these loans by entering into a structured facility, under which we take a senior lien position collateralized by the underlying assets at advance rates well below the collateral value. Leveraged cash flow loans rely on free cash flow as a primary repayment source and enterprise value as the secondary repayment source. The liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default may be an insufficient source of repayment because accounts or loans receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the structuring of these lending products, adhering to underwriting policies in evaluating the management of the business and the creditworthiness of borrowers and guarantors.Auto & ConsumerOur Auto loans are secured by new and used automobiles (“auto”) and are sourced primarily through indirect channels. Originations are prime credit quality with a fixed interest rate and terms ranging from three to eight years.
We retain and service all of the auto originations. A subset of loans serviced in the portfolio continue to include a legacy product no longer offered on new originations that is composed of default risk-insured subprime borrowers. Ongoing collections of insured losses will continue as this population of loans remains active in the portfolio.Our Consumer loans are fixed rate, unsecured loans to well-qualified, individual borrowers sourced through existing bank customers, lead aggregators and other marketing efforts.Loan Underwriting Process and CriteriaOur loan underwriting policies and procedures are written and adopted by our Bank’s Board of Directors and our Bank’s Credit Committee. Credit extensions by the Bank conform to the intent and technical requirements of our lending policies and the applicable lending regulations of our federal regulators.In the single family loan underwriting process, we consider all relevant factors including the borrower’s credit score, credit history, documented income, existing and new debt obligations, the value of the collateral, and other internal and external factors. For all multifamily and commercial real estate loans, we rely primarily on the cash flow from the underlying property as the expected source of repayment. Additionally, the Bank often obtains personal guarantees from all material owners or partners of the borrower. In evaluating multifamily or commercial real estate credit, we consider all relevant factors, including the outside financial assets of the material owners or partners, payment history at the Bank or other financial institutions, and the experience of management and/or ownership with similar properties or businesses. In evaluating the underlying property, we consider the recurring net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of net operating income to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value. For construction loans, we consider borrower 2experience and may obtain project completion guarantees from our borrowers and require borrowers to fund costs that exceed the initial construction budgets. As part of the underwriting of construction loans, we consider market conditions and perform stress testing to help ensure payoff via refinance or sale will cover any loan proceeds advanced. In underwriting commercial & industrial – non-real estate loans, we primarily consider the borrowers’ operating cash flows and the value of underlying collateral. Additionally, in our commercial real estate and commercial & industrial – non-RE loans we typically take a senior lien position in a structured facility collateralized by the underlying assets.For additional information on the Company’s loan portfolio, including asset quality and the allowance for credit losses, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis — “Financial Condition.”Available-for-Sale Securities Portfolio We buy and sell available-for-sale securities to facilitate liquidity and to manage our interest rate risk. Our investment policy is designed to maintain liquidity and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk, credit risk or asset concentration risk. Under our investment policy, the Bank is authorized to invest in agency mortgage-backed obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the United States government, non-agency asset-backed obligations, specific federal agency obligations, municipal obligations, specific time deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks and other insured financial institutions, investment grade corporate debt securities and other specified investments. We manage the credit risk of our non-agency securities by assessing historic credit performance and any remaining credit enhancements including subordination, over collateralization, excess spread and purchase discounts. Substantially all of our non-agency securities are senior tranches protected from credit losses by subordinated tranches. For additional information on our available-for-sale securities portfolio, refer to Note 3—“Fair Value” and Note 4—“Available-For-Sale Securities” in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Deposits We generate deposits through a variety of channels, including advertisements, sales teams, software company affiliates, financial advisory firms, affinity partnerships and our lending businesses. Our deposit lines of business include:•Commercial deposits, which primarily include deposits sourced from a targeted set of industry verticals:◦Commercial Banking Verticals, which include middle market industries along with deposit relationships from commercial real estate and commercial & industrial clients◦Specialty Deposit Verticals, which include title, escrow, home owner association (“HOA”) and property management, 1031 exchange, trust & estates and payment processors; and◦Software Verticals, which include:▪Axos Fiduciary Services: A full-service fiduciary team catered specifically to support bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy trustees and fiduciaries with their software and banking needs, and▪Zenith Information Systems, Inc.: A business management and entertainment accounting and payroll software offering supported by a dedicated service team.•Consumer deposits, which primarily include retail and small business deposits as well as sweep deposits from financial advisory and clearing firms, including Axos Clearing and its business division, AAS.We believe our deposit franchise will continue to provide strategic funding advantages with greater scalability than branch-intensive banking models because the traditional branch model operates with limited marketing reach and slower deposit fundraising capabilities, in addition to inherently higher fixed operating costs.SECURITIES BUSINESS SEGMENTThe Securities Business Segment provides a wide range of investment and wealth management services to individual and institutional clients, primarily through Axos Clearing and its business division, AAS. At June 30, 2025, we provided services to 327 financial organizations, including correspondent broker-dealers and RIAs. Axos Clearing offers fully disclosed clearing services to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and SEC registered member firms for trade execution and clearance in addition to back-office services such as recordkeeping, trade reporting, and reorganization assistance. Axos Clearing also provides margin loans, which are collateralized by securities or cash, and conducts securities lending activities, including borrowing and lending securities with other broker-dealers.3AAS provides RIAs who custody client accounts at Axos with a proprietary turnkey technology platform with client-account information as well as trading capabilities. This technology platform provides account servicing capabilities for RIAs, including account opening, money movement, transfer of assets, trading, and communication with our service team. AAS also provides integrations with third-party platforms, which support a variety of advisor needs including client relationship management, portfolio management, trade order management and financial planning.Also included in the Securities Business Segment is Axos Invest, which provides retail self-directed and digital advice services.The Securities Business Segment generates both fee and interest income and is also a source of low-cost deposits for the Banking Business Segment.BORROWINGS For additional information on the Company’s borrowings, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7.MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS From time to time, we undertake acquisitions or similar transactions consistent with our operating and growth strategies. For additional information, see “Mergers and Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 7.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTSAs part of our strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of legal protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, internet domain name registration, and certain contractual restrictions on solicitation and competition. We also undertake measures to control access to and/or disclosure of our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other proprietary information is difficult, and litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. HUMAN CAPITALAt June 30, 2025, we had 1,989 full-time employees, which does not include seasonal interns. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We offer market-based, competitive wages and benefits in the markets where we compete for talent.Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future, reward and support employees through competitive pay, and provide benefit and perquisite programs. The Company also invests in technology, training, tools and resources to enable employees to effectively and efficiently perform their responsibilities and achieve their potential. We believe this is important to recruiting and retaining talent to allow our organization to achieve its goals and objectives.COMPETITIONThe market for banking and financial services is intensely competitive, and we expect this competition to continue. The Banking Business Segment primarily attracts deposits through its banking sales force and online acquisition channels. Competition for those deposits comes from a wide variety of
depository and non-depository financial institutions. The Banking Business Segment competes for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. In real estate lending, we compete against traditional real estate lenders, including large and small savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, insurance companies, private equity firms and hedge funds. In our Securities Business Segment, we face significant competition in providing clearing and advisory services based on a number of factors, including price, speed of execution, perceived expertise, quality of advice, reputation, range of services and products, technology, and innovation. There exists significant competition for recruiting and retaining talent. Axos Clearing competes directly with numerous other financial advisory and investment banking firms, broker-dealers and banks, including large national and major regional firms and smaller niche companies. Additionally, certain competitors are not broker-dealers and, therefore, are not subject to the broker-dealer regulatory framework. We separate ourselves from the competition through our excellence in customer service, including a highly attentive and dedicated workforce, while providing an expanding range of clearing and advisory products and services.4Many of our current and potential competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories and larger customer bases, and may also have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources, which may result in further price and customer service competition. Technological innovation and capabilities, including changes in product delivery systems and web-based tools, continue to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets, and larger competitors may be able to allocate more resources to these technological initiatives. SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERALWe are subject to comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of our customers, the deposit insurance fund (“DIF”), and the U.S. financial system, not for the benefit of our security holders. Axos Financial, Inc. is supervised and regulated as a savings and loan holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Bank, a federal savings association, has elected to operate as a covered savings association and is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the OCC as its primary regulator and the FDIC as its deposit insurer. In connection with its election to operate as a covered savings association, the Bank was required to become a member of the Federal Reserve System and subscribe to the capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “FRBSF”).The Bank must file reports with the OCC, and the FDIC and Axos Financial, Inc. with the Federal Reserve, concerning their activities and financial condition. In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulation, examination, and supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to a broad array of federal consumer laws.
Our subsidiaries, Axos Clearing LLC and Axos Invest LLC, are broker-dealers and are registered with and subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. In addition, Axos Invest, Inc., an investment adviser, is registered with the SEC. Axos Invest, Inc. is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is subject to examination by the SEC.The following information describes aspects of the material laws and regulations applicable to the Company. The information below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new and amended legislation, rules and regulations governing the Company are introduced from time to time by the U.S. government and its various agencies. Any such legislation, regulatory changes or amendments could adversely affect us and no assurance can be given as to whether, or in what form, any such changes may occur.Financial holding companies are generally permitted to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are “financial in nature.” Such activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and sales; merchant banking; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. If the Bank ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities. In addition, if the Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act, we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. If a financial holding company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, including those described above, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve.REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANYGeneral. Axos Financial is required to file reports with, comply with the rules and regulations of, and is subject to examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over Axos Financial and its subsidiaries.
Capital. Our Company and the Bank are subject to the risk-based regulatory capital framework and guidelines established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC published final rules (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”) establishing a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Regulatory Capital Rules are intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization’s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements.5The Regulatory Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 capital framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The failure of the Company or the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that could have a material effect on the Company, explained in more detail below under “Regulation of Axos Bank”.The Regulatory Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain a minimum “common equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a total risk-based capital ratio, and a minimum leverage ratio (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these regulatory minimum levels is required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends.The Regulatory Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. In addition, trust preferred securities have been phased out of tier 1 capital for banking organizations that had $15.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 unless the banking organization grows above $15.0 billion in assets as a result of an acquisition. The Company’s trust preferred securities currently are grandfathered under this provision and therefore continue to be treated as part of tier 1 capital. In addition, the Company and the Bank elected the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) five-year transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital ratios on July 1, 2020, and such election is reflected in the June 30, 2025 ratios. This guidance allowed an entity to add back to capital 100% of the capital impact from the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25% of subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2022. This cumulative amount was phased out of regulatory capital over the three years beginning July 1, 2022, and will no longer be reflected as a regulatory capital adjustment from July 1, 2025 onward.The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company and the Bank. Various aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules continue to be subject to further evaluation and interpretation by the U.S. banking regulators. As of June 30, 2025, the capital ratios of both the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimums necessary to be considered “well-capitalized” under the capital adequacy requirements. For additional information, please see Note 19— “Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extends the Federal Reserve’s “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. Such policy requires holding companies to act as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of an institution’s financial distress. Change in Control. The federal banking laws require that appropriate regulatory approvals must be obtained before an individual or company may take actions to “control” a bank or savings association.Volcker Rule. Under certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, are generally prohibited from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in private equity and hedge funds and certain other entities. The prohibitions under the Volcker Rule are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, restrictions, and definitions.Potential Regulatory Enforcement Actions. If the Federal Reserve or the OCC determines that a savings and loan holding company’s or federal savings bank’s financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of its operations are unsatisfactory or that its management has violated any law or regulation, the agency has the authority to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. These actions include, among other things, the power to enjoin any “unsafe or unsound” banking practices; to require that affirmative action be taken to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice; to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; to require that it increase its capital; to restrict its growth; assess civil monetary penalties against it or its officers or directors; and to remove any of its officers and directors.6REGULATION OF AXOS BANKGeneral. As a covered savings association, the Bank maintains its charter as a federal savings bank, but is treated as a national bank, except for certain enumerated purposes. As such, Axos has the power to engage in the same activities as a national bank, subject to the same authorization, terms, and conditions as a national bank. Furthermore, covered savings associations generally are afforded the same rights and privileges as national banks under the National Bank Act and other applicable federal laws and regulations. As a covered savings association, the Bank is not required to comply with the lending limits established by the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”) that are applicable to federal savings associations. Axos Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OCC, FDIC and the CFPB with respect to federal consumer financial laws. The following discussion summarizes some of the principal areas of regulation applicable to the Bank and its operations. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC administers the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) which insures depositors in certain types of accounts up to a prescribed amount for the loss of any such depositor’s respective deposits due to the failure of an FDIC member depository institution. As the administrator of the DIF, the FDIC assesses its member depository institutions and determines the appropriate DIF premiums to be paid by each such institution. The FDIC is authorized to examine its member institutions and to require that they file periodic reports of their condition and operations. The FDIC may also prohibit any member institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations, after giving the primary federal regulator the opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may terminate an institution’s access to the DIF if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our access to the DIF.Axos Bank is a member depository institution of the FDIC and its deposits are insured by the DIF up to the applicable limits, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action. The prompt corrective action regulation of the OCC requires mandatory actions and authorizes other discretionary actions to be taken by the OCC against a savings association that falls within the undercapitalized capital categories specified in OCC regulations: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.In general, the prompt corrective action regulation prohibits an FDIC member institution from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distribution, or paying a management fee to a controlling person if, following the distribution or payment, the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories described above. In addition, adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC, but are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits.If the OCC determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice, the OCC may reclassify the institution’s capital category or subject the institution to certain restrictions. Further, the FDIC can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination rating or is considered undercapitalized, so long as the FDIC provides reasonable prior notice to the institution’s primary regulator.Capital regulations applicable to the Bank require the Bank to meet an additional capital standard of tangible capital equal to at least 1.5% of total average adjusted assets.The Bank’s capital requirements are viewed as minimum standards and most financial institutions are expected to maintain capital levels well above the minimum. In addition, OCC regulations provide that minimum capital levels greater than those provided in the regulations may be established by the OCC for individual savings associations upon a determination that the savings association’s capital is or may become inadequate in view of its circumstances. Axos Bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement and the Bank’s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as of June 30, 2025. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—“Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Stress Testing. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act set the asset threshold for enhanced prudential standards and stress testing at $100 billion of total consolidated assets. Neither the Company nor the Bank are subject to enhanced stress test regulations. The federal banking agencies have indicated that the capital planning and risk management practices of financial institutions with total assets less than $100 billion will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. We plan to continue monitoring our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the Federal Reserve and will continue to use customized stress testing as part of our capital planning process.7Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to, among other things: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth safety and soundness standards that the federal banking regulatory agencies use to identify and address problems at FDIC member institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by these guidelines, the OCC may require us to submit to it an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the required standards. OCC regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans in response to any such determination. Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. Savings associations generally are subject to certain lending limits. With limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a savings association may lend to any borrower, including related entities of the borrower, at one time may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral.Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a covered savings association, the Bank is no longer required to satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL” test. Liquidity Standard. Savings associations are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As of June 30, 2025, Axos Bank was in compliance with the applicable liquidity standard. For additional information on the Company’s liquidity, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7.Transactions with Related Parties. The authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (i.e., any company that controls or is under common control with it, including the Company and any non-depository institution subsidiaries) is limited by federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of a savings institution’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in federal law. The purchase of low-quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies, and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits loans by public companies to their executive officers and directors. However, there is a specific exception for loans by financial institutions, such as the Bank, to its executive officers and directors that are made in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, our authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors, and 10% or more stockholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on its capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and cannot involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees.Capital Distribution Limitations. OCC regulations limit the ability of a savings association to make capital distributions, such as cash dividends. These regulations limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or other capital distributions to the Company, which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Under these regulations, a savings association may, in circumstances described in those regulations:•Be required to file an application and await approval from the OCC before it makes a capital distribution;•Be required to file a notice 30 days before the capital distribution; or•Be permitted to make the capital distribution without notice or application to the OCC.Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws. Savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications for certain expansionary activities. In addition, an institution’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the OCC, other federal regulatory agencies or 8the Department of Justice, taking enforcement actions against the institution. In the most recent Community Reinvestment Act Report, issued in April 2023, the Bank received a ‘Satisfactory’ rating covering calendar years 2019, 2020, and 2021.Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in a Federal Home Loan Bank in specified amounts based on either its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year or its outstanding advances from the FHLB.Federal Reserve Banking System. The Bank is a member of its regional Federal Reserve Bank. As a covered savings association, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and was in compliance with this requirement at June 30, 2025.Activities of Subsidiaries. A savings association seeking to establish a new subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary must provide not less than 30 days prior notice to the FDIC and the OCC and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the OCC. The OCC has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OCC determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices.Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB with broad rule-making, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB is an independent “watchdog” within the Federal Reserve System with authority to enforce and create (i) rules, orders and guidelines of the CFPB, (ii) all consumer financial protection functions, powers and duties transferred from other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and (iii) a long list of consumer financial protection laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among many others. The CFPB has broad examination and enforcement authority, including the power to issue subpoenas and cease and desist orders, commence civil actions, hold investigations and hearings and seek civil penalties, as well as the authority to regulate disclosures, mandate registration of any covered person and to regulate what it considers unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive practices.Depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and their affiliates are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank had $23.9 billion in total assets, placing the Bank under the direct supervision and oversight of the CFPB. The laws and regulations of the CFPB and other consumer protection laws and regulations to which the Bank is subject mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we must deal with customers when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, our customers.Privacy Standards and Cybersecurity. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. The Bank is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.In addition to the GLBA, we are subject to various other federal and state laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations which impose standards and requirements related to cybersecurity. For additional information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Part I, Item 1C “Cybersecurity.”Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering. The Bank, its affiliated broker-dealers and in certain cases Axos Financial, Inc., are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act includes various record keeping and reporting requirements such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government broad powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened 9anti-money laundering requirements. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation and Anti-Corruption. The Bank and its affiliated broker-dealers are also required to comply with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, individuals, entities and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC rules,” based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with, or investment in, a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from, and exports to, a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of government officials and others. Failure to comply with these sanctions and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws and regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences.    REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS SEGMENTOur correspondent clearing and custodial firm Axos Clearing, and introducing broker Axos Invest LLC, are broker-dealers registered with the SEC, members of FINRA and licensed with all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and various other self-regulatory organizations. Axos Clearing also uses various clearing organizations, including the Depository Trust Company, the National Securities Clearing Corporation, Euroclear and the Options Clearing Corporation. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board or national securities exchanges. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) for governing their members and the industry. Broker-dealers are also subject to federal regulation and the securities laws of each state where they conduct business. Our broker-dealers are primarily subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by FINRA.Broker-dealers are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations covering all aspects of the Securities Business Segment, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, record keeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, qualification and licensing of supervisory and sales personnel, marketing practices, supervisory and organizational procedures intended to ensure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information, limitations on extensions of credit in securities transactions, clearance and settlement procedures, and rules designed to promote high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. Broker-dealers are regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Regulators may conduct periodic examinations and review reports of our operations, controls, supervision, performance, and financial condition. Our broker-dealers’ margin lending is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board’s restrictions on lending in connection with client purchases and short sales of securities, and FINRA rules require our broker-dealers to impose maintenance requirements based on the value of securities contained in margin accounts. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by the SEC and FINRA, apply to the municipal securities activities of Axos Clearing and Axos Invest LLC.Violations of laws, rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its registered representatives, officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences. The investment advisory services provided by Axos Invest, Inc are regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on our investment advisory business, including fiduciary duties, possible conflicts of interest, unsuitable investment recommendations, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Our failure to comply with the Advisers Act and associated rules and regulations of the SEC could subject us to enforcement proceedings and sanctions for violations, including censure or termination of SEC registration, litigation and reputational harm. In addition, our investment advisory business is subject to notice filings and the anti-fraud rules of state securities regulators.Significant new rules and regulations continue to arise from the SEC and the Dodd-Frank Act, including the implementation of a more stringent fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and increased regulation of investment advisers. Compliance with these provisions could result in increased costs. Moreover, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act affects the 10operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements of financial institutions with whom we do business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us. Limitation on Businesses. The businesses that our broker-dealers may conduct are limited by its agreements with, and its oversight by, FINRA, other regulatory authorities and federal and state law. Participation in new business lines, including trading of new products or participation on new exchanges or in new countries often requires governmental and/or exchange approvals, which may take significant time and resources. In addition, our broker-dealers are operating subsidiaries of Axos, which means their activities may be further limited by those that are permissible for subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and as a result, may be prevented from entering new businesses that may be profitable in a timely manner, if at all. Net Capital Requirements. The SEC, FINRA and various other regulatory authorities have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act (the “Net Capital Rule”) requires that a broker-dealer maintain minimum net capital. Generally, a broker-dealer’s net capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for non-allowable (or non-liquid) assets and other adjustments and operational charges. As of June 30, 2025, our broker-dealers were in compliance with applicable net capital requirements. The SEC, FINRA and other regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined thresholds. These rules dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. If a broker-dealer fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to penalties and other regulatory sanctions, including suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC or applicable regulatory authorities, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could ultimately lead to the broker-dealer’s liquidation. Additionally, the Net Capital Rule and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to, and approval from, the SEC and FINRA for certain capital withdrawals. Compliance with the net capital requirements may limit our operations, requiring the intensive use of capital. Such rules require that a certain percentage of a broker-dealer’s assets be maintained in relatively liquid form and therefore act to restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer entities, which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, repay debt, meet our debt covenant requirements or to expand or maintain our operations. In addition, such rules may require us to make substantial capital contributions into one or more of our broker-dealers in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules, either in the form of cash or subordinated loans made in accordance with the requirements of all applicable net capital rules. Customer Protection Rule. Our broker-dealers that hold customers’ funds and securities are subject to the SEC’s customer protection rule (Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act), which generally provides that such broker-dealers maintain physical possession or control of all fully-paid securities and excess margin securities carried for the account of customers and maintain certain reserves of cash or qualified securities. Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Our broker-dealers are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act and belong to SIPC, whose primary function is to provide financial protection for the customers of failing brokerage firms. SIPC provides protection for customers up to $500,000, of which a maximum of $250,000 may be in cash. Anti-Money Laundering. Our broker-dealers must comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and other rules and regulations, including FINRA requirements, designed to fight international money laundering and to block terrorist access to the U.S. financial system. We are required to have systems and procedures to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations. Form Customer Relationship Summary (“Form CRS”). The SEC Form CRS requires registered investment advisors and broker-dealers to deliver to retail investors a succinct, plain English summary about the relationship and services provided by the firm and the required standard of conduct associated with the relationship and services. 11AVAILABLE INFORMATIONAxos Financial, Inc. files reports, proxy and information statements and other information electronically with the SEC.

RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks disclosed in this section may have already materialized. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Relating to Macroeconomic ConditionsChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our performance.Our results of operations depend to a great extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. We are exposed to interest rate risk because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not react uniformly or concurrently to changes in interest rates, as they may have different time periods for adjustment and can be tied to different measures of rates. Interest rates are sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including domestic and international economic conditions, including inflation, and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, implemented through open market operations, the federal funds rate (“Fed Funds Rate”) targets, and the discount rate for banking borrowings and reserve requirements, affect prevailing interest rates. A material change in any of these policies could have a material impact on us or our customers (including borrowers), and therefore on our results of operations. Loan originations and repayment rates tend to increase with declining interest rates and decrease with rising interest rates. Increases in interest rates can negatively impact our business, including a possible reduction in customers’ or potential customers’ desire to borrow money or adversely affecting customers’ ability to repay on outstanding loans by increasing their debt obligations. On the deposit side, increasing interest rates generally lead to higher rates paid for our deposit accounts. While we manage the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, large, unanticipated, or rapid increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and could decrease our mortgage refinancing business and related fee income, and could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing loans and leases in our adjustable-rate loans. In addition, interest rate volatility can affect the value of our loans and leases, investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets and our ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of these assets, which in turn may affect our liquidity. Although we have implemented risk management strategies, as well as policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk. If borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions in the future are significantly different than we anticipate, then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.A significant or sustained economic downturn could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and leases and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending. We operate in an uncertain economic environment due to a variety of other reasons including, but not limited to, trade policies and disputes, tariffs, geopolitical tensions and global military conflicts, and volatile energy prices. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. Furthermore, given our high concentration of loans secured by real estate in California and New York, the Company remains particularly susceptible to a downturn in those states’ economies. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.12The specific impact on us of unfavorable or uncertain economic or market conditions is difficult to predict, could be long or short term, and may be direct or indirect. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects, including the following:•a decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services we offer;•a decrease in deposit balances, including low-cost and non-interest-bearing deposits, and changes in our interest rate mix toward higher-cost deposits;•an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses;•a decrease in the value of loans and other assets secured by collateral such as consumer or commercial real estate;•a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities;•an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill; •an increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry; and•an increase in borrowing costs in excess of changes in the rate at which we reinvest funds.Inflation has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact our business and our profitability.Prolonged periods of inflation have impacted, and may continue to impact our profitability by negatively impacting our non-interest expenses, including increasing expense related to talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, inflation has led to, and may continue to lead to, a decrease in consumer and client purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our willingness to offer new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.The value of our securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.The fair market value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by general economic and market conditions, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio or any given market segment or industry in which we are invested. We analyze our available-for-sale securities on a quarterly basis to measure any impairment and potential credit losses. The process for determining impairment and any credit losses usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving principal and interest payments sufficient to recover our amortized cost of the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize credit losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The weakness of other financial institutions or other companies in the financial services industries could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, and transacting with one another. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers-dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated, liquidated timely, or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, in our fund finance commercial lending business, clients have capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These third parties may not be able to meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which ultimately could have an adverse impact on us.13Events, both actual or rumored, involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally have in the past, and may in the future, lead to erosion of customer confidence in the financial services industry, deposit volatility, liquidity issues, stock price volatility and other adverse developments, including increased regulatory oversight, increased premiums for the FDIC insurance program, higher capital requirements or changes in the way regulatory capital is calculated, and impositions of additional restrictions through regulatory changes or supervisory or enforcement activities. As a result, our operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.The economy, financial services industry and our business and operating results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.Our business and financial results are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government of the United States and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, including the regulation of the supply of money and credit in the United States. The Federal Reserve and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect our business and operating results. It is difficult to predict the legislative and executive regulatory changes that will result from the current Congress and Presidential Administration. President Trump and certain members of Congress have advocated for the reduction of regulation of the financial services industry. Congress and the current administration may also cause broader economic changes due to various changes in the federal government’s approach to regulation and administration. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”) could also affect monetary policy and interest rates. Future legislation, regulation, and changes in trade and fiscal
policy, including uncertainty surrounding the ongoing operations of the CFPB, could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies, including, but not limited to, changes resulting from efforts to limit the operations of the CFPB.Changes in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The current Presidential Administration has implemented, or threatened to implement, tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, as well as other trade restrictions, against U.S. trading partners. In response to tariffs, foreign countries have implemented, or may implement, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Historically, tariffs have led to increased trade and political tensions. Political tensions as a result of trade policies could reduce trade volume, investment, technological exchange, and other economic activities between major international economies, resulting in a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. It may also cause the prices of our customers’ products to increase, which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customers’ margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results, and ability to service debt. This, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the international trade environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. At this time, it remains unclear what the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not continue to do with respect to tariff policies
or international trade agreements and policies.Risks Relating to Regulation of our BusinessChanges in laws, regulations or oversight or increased enforcement activities by regulatory agencies may increase our costs and adversely affect our business and operations.We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to oversight, regulation and examination by federal and/or state governmental authorities under various laws, regulations and policies, which impose requirements or restrictions on our operations, capitalization, payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged and interest rates paid on deposits. We must also comply with federal anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, tax withholding and reporting, and various consumer protection statutes and regulations. A considerable amount of management time and resources is devoted to oversight of, and development, implementation and execution of controls and procedures relating to, compliance with these laws, regulations and policies. The laws, rules, regulations and supervisory policies governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund, not our stockholders or other creditors and 14are subject to regular modification and change. New or amended laws, rules, regulations and policies, including those resulting from changes in U.S. Presidential administration, could impact our operations, increase our capital requirements or substantially restrict our growth and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably by making compliance more difficult or expensive, restricting our ability to originate or sell loans, or impacting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products. It is difficult to predict future changes in regulation or the competitive impact that any such changes would have on our business. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult, expensive, costly to implement or may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or growth prospects. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including subjecting us to additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, and increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and similar laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the United States Department of Treasury, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. There is increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators have focused on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Several banking institutions have received large fines, or suffered limitations on their operations, for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies, procedures and processes designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies, procedures and processes will be effective in detecting violations of these laws and regulations. If our policies, procedures, processes and systems are deemed deficient, we may be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approval to proceed with acquisitions and other strategic transactions, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have material adverse reputational consequences for us.State regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. New laws or changes to existing laws, including privacy-related enforcement activity, increase our operating and compliance costs (including technology costs) and could reduce income from certain business initiatives or restrict our ability to provide certain products and services. Our failure, or perceived failure, to comply with privacy policies, or applicable data protection and information security laws, regulations, rules, standards or contractual obligations, could result in significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our failure to comply with current, or adapt to new or changing, laws, regulations or policies could result in enforcement actions and sanctions against us by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, along with corrective action plans required by regulatory agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the value of our common stock. The financial services industry and broader economy may be subject to new or changing regulation or government policy.Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions in administrative law could redefine the power of federal agencies to interpret and apply federal regulations, which could affect our business, prospects and operations, and our financial performance. In Loper Bright, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act requires that courts exercise independent judgment to determine whether a federal agency has acted within its statutory authority, and not to defer to an agency interpretation when a statute is ambiguous. The Loper Bright decision may result in additional legal challenges to interpretations by federal regulatory agencies, including those which Axos and the Bank rely on and intend to rely on in the future. Successful challenges of such regulations and guidance could have an impact on our business which could be material. Further, President Trump issued Executive Order 14215 in February of 2025, requiring all executive departments and agencies, including the FRB in connection with its supervision and regulation of financial institutions, to submit all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs prior to publication in the Federal Register. Potential increased regulatory uncertainty following Loper Bright and delays or other impacts to the federal agency rulemaking process following Executive Order 14215 could adversely impact the financial services industry and the broader economy, as well as our business and operations.15Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or to satisfy our regulators' supervisory expectations, could subject us to supervisory or enforcement action, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, if we are deemed to have engaged in unsafe or unsound conduct, or if we do not satisfy our regulators’ supervisory expectations, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, supervisory criticism, litigation and/or a wide range of potential monetary penalties, or enforcement actions. Such actions could arise even if we are acting in good faith or operating under a reasonable interpretation of the law. Such actions could include monetary penalties, payment of damages, restitution or disgorgement of profits, directives to take remedial action or to cease or modify practices, restrictions on growth or expansionary proposals, denial or refusal to accept applications, removal of officers or directors, a prohibition on dividends or capital distributions, increases in capital or liquidity requirements and/or termination of the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of reputational harm.The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws and the interpretation of existing laws and examinations and challenges by taxing authorities. Our financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Given the current economic and political environment and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state legislation or new interpretations of existing tax laws could adversely impact our tax position, in some circumstances retroactively. The Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”), which established a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted book income (of corporations that have an average adjusted book income in excess of $1 billion over a three-tax year period) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, may impact the Company’s cash tax payments and tax credit carryforward balances. The IRA includes a nondeductible 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of corporate stock for transactions occurring after December 31, 2022, which increases the Company’s cost of share repurchases exceeding certain thresholds. Additionally, in June 2025, the State of California adopted its fiscal year 2026 budget, which, among other things, changed the way financial institutions’ multi-state income is apportioned to the State of California. This change impacted the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities and its expected effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2026 and beyond. The consequences of the IRA, the 2025 change in California state tax law, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation, or other changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting income tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, and credits, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.In the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to examinations and audits from federal, state, and local taxing authorities regarding tax positions taken by us and the determination of the amount of taxes due. These examinations may relate to income, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, sales and use, or other tax returns. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the amount of taxes due and may result in the imposition of penalties and interest. If any such challenges are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Our broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subject us to regulatory risks. Our broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subject us to regulation by the SEC, FINRA, other self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), state securities commissions, and other regulatory bodies. Violations of the laws and regulations governed by these agencies could result in censure; penalties and fines; the issuance of cease-and-desist orders; the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of the Company or its officers or employees; or other similar adverse consequences, any of which could cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations. Clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than introducing brokers that rely on others to perform clearing functions. Similarly, the attorney general of each state could bring legal action to ensure compliance with state securities laws, and regulatory agencies in foreign countries have similar authority. Our ability to comply with multiple laws and regulations pertaining to the securities industry depends in large part on our ability to establish and maintain an effective compliance function. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions. Federally registered investment advisers are regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on our investment advisory business, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Our failure to comply with the Advisers Act and associated rules and regulations of the SEC could subject us to enforcement proceedings and sanctions for violations, including censure or termination of SEC registration, litigation and reputational harm. In addition, our investment advisory business is subject to notice filings and the anti-fraud rules of state securities regulators. See “Regulation of the Securities Business Segment.”16Policies and regulations enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may negatively impact our consumer business and increase our compliance burdens.Our consumer business, including our mortgage and deposit businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the CFPB, which, under the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad rule-making authority over consumer financial products and services. While it is difficult to quantify any future increases in our regulatory compliance burden, the costs associated with regulatory compliance, including the need to hire additional compliance personnel, may continue to increase.We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.The Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations (collectively, “Fair Lending Laws”) impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these federal laws and regulations and comparable state provisions. Federal, state or local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under the Fair Lending Laws could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Commercial Loans, Mortgage Loans and Mortgage-Backed SecuritiesOur real estate loan portfolio is subject to certain risks including market, environmental and project-specific risks.Our real estate loan portfolio encompasses commercial real estate, residential real estate, and real estate construction and land loans, which implicate a variety of risks, including: (i) market risks including increased competition in pricing and loan structure, macroeconomic conditions in the United States and in the markets where we lend, and decreased commercial and residential real estate values in the markets where we lend; (ii) environmental risks including natural disasters and impact on underlying real estate collateral and environmental liabilities with respect to real properties acquired; and (iii) project-specific risks including higher construction costs, failure by developers and contractors to meet project specifications or timelines, and buyers of completed construction projects not being able to secure permanent financing.Declining real estate values, particularly in California and New York, could reduce the value of our loan and lease portfolio and impair our profitability and financial condition.The majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. At June 30, 2025, approximately 35.8% and 28.2% of our real estate loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California and New York, respectively. In recent years, there has been significant volatility in real estate values. If real estate values decrease or more of our borrowers experience financial difficulties, we will experience increased charge-offs, as the proceeds resulting from foreclosure may be significantly lower than the amounts outstanding on such loans and the time to foreclose may be extended. In addition, declining real estate values frequently accompany periods of economic downturn or recession and increasing unemployment, all of which can lead to lower demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate and impact the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. A decline of real estate values or decline of the credit position of our borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.Many of our mortgage loans are multifamily residential loans and defaults on such loans would harm our business.At June 30, 2025, our multifamily residential loans were $2.9 billion or 13.6% of our loan portfolio. The payment on such loans is typically dependent on the cash flows generated by the projects, which are affected by the supply and demand for multifamily residential units and commercial property within the relative market. If the market for multifamily residential units and commercial property experiences a decline in demand, multifamily and commercial borrowers may suffer losses on their projects and be unable to repay their loans. If residential housing values were to decline or nationwide unemployment levels rise, we are likely to experience increases in the level of our non-performing loans and foreclosures in future periods.17A decrease in the mortgage buying activity of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and MBS’s guaranteed by Ginnie Mae or a failure by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.During the last three fiscal years we have sold approximately $297.7 million of residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and into MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 70.8% of our securities portfolio consisted of RMBS issued or guaranteed by these entities. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. The United States government may enact structural changes to one or more of the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), including privatization, consolidation and/or a reduction in the ability of GSEs to purchase mortgage loans or guarantee mortgage obligations. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or what associated changes (if any) may be made to the structure, mandate or overall business practices of either of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form and whether they will continue to meet their obligations with respect to their RMBS. A substantial reduction in mortgage purchasing activity by the GSEs could result in a material decrease in the availability of residential mortgage loans and the number of qualified borrowers, which in turn may lead to increased volatility in the residential housing market, including a decrease in demand for residential housing and a corresponding drop in the value of real property that secures current residential mortgage loans, as well as a significant increase in interest rates. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, which would result in a decrease in mortgage loan revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income. Any decision to change the structure, mandate or overall business practices of the GSEs and/or the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private mortgage loan markets, or any failure by the GSEs to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans may expose our company to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio was approximately $6.8 billion at June 30, 2025, or 31.6% of our total loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally carry large balances and may involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the types of business and collateral, the size of loan balances, the effects of nationwide and regional economic conditions on income-producing properties and businesses and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Sustained economic downturns increases the risk of credit losses or charge-offs related to our commercial and industrial loans. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans. Any significant failure to pay on time or other significant default by our clients would materially and adversely affect us.Our commercial real estate portfolio was approximately $6.9 billion, or 32.2% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2025. The commercial real estate loans we make are secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, retail centers, mixed-use buildings and multi-tenanted light industrial properties. At June 30, 2025, $389.2 million, or 7%, of our commercial real estate specialty loan portfolio was secured by office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a potentially long-term negative impact on certain commercial real estate portfolios due to the risk that tenants may reduce the office space they lease as some portion of the workforce continues to work remotely on a hybrid or full-time basis. A reduction in the need for office space could result in a reduction in demand for these categories of commercial office and/or in our customers’ ability to repay their loans, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Commercial real estate markets may face downward pressure due in part to increasing interest rates and declining property values. Accordingly, the federal banking agencies may apply increased regulatory scrutiny to institutions with commercial real estate loan portfolios that are fast growing or large relative to the institutions’ total capital. Banking regulatory authorities may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced risk management practices – including stricter underwriting, additional internal controls and risk management policies, more detailed reporting, and portfolio stress testing – as well as potential higher allowances for credit losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposure. Our failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage the commercial real estate segment of our loan portfolio and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, our loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.A downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas of California and New York could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and shareholders’ equity 18could be adversely affected. Unexpected decreases in commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management's time and attention, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our mortgage origination business is subject to fluctuations based upon seasonal and other factors and, as a result, our results of operations for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.Our mortgage origination business is subject to several variables that can impact loan origination volume, including seasonal and interest rate fluctuations. We typically experience increased loan origination volume from purchases of homes during the second and third calendar quarters, when more people tend to move and buy or sell homes. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may, among other things, adversely affect the demand for mortgage loans and our ability to originate mortgage loans. In particular, if mortgage interest rates increase, the demand for residential mortgage loans and the refinancing of residential mortgage loans will likely decrease, which will have an adverse effect on our mortgage origination activities. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to increased competition for mortgage loan origination business.As a result of these variables, our results of operations for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any other quarter.Risks Relating to our Business OperationsOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies, including with respect to our allowance for credit losses.From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments, include methodologies to value our securities, estimate our allowance for credit losses and evaluate goodwill and other intangibles for impairment. These methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions; factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our earnings, capital adequacy and overall financial condition may suffer materially.Our loans are generally secured by single family, multifamily and commercial real estate properties or other commercial assets, each initially having a fair market value generally greater than the amount of the loan secured. Although our loans and leases are typically secured, the risk of default, generally due to a borrower’s inability to make scheduled payments on his or her loan, is an inherent risk of the Banking Business Segment. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and our loss history. Defaults by borrowers could result in losses that exceed our loan and lease loss reserves. We may not have sufficient repayment experience to be certain whether the established allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate for certain types of loans and leases. We may have to establish a larger allowance for credit losses in the future if, in our judgment, it becomes necessary. To the extent that we fail to adequately address the risks associated with non-residential lending, particularly in commercial and industrial lending, including loans collateralized by customer securities, we may experience increases in levels of non-performing loans and leases and be forced to record additional provisions for credit losses, which would adversely affect our capital levels and reduce our profitability. Rapid changes in the fair value of the customer securities serving as collateral may not be sufficiently covered by any excess collateral. For further information about our commercial and industrial lending business, please refer to “Business - Loan Portfolio - Commercial & Industrial - Non-Real Estate.”While we believe we have established appropriate underwriting and ongoing monitoring policies and procedures for our lending activities, there can be no assurance that such underwriting and ongoing monitoring policies and procedures are, or 19will continue to be, appropriate or that losses on loans will not require increased allowances for loan and lease losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses would increase our expenses and consequently may adversely affect our profitability, capital adequacy and overall financial condition.Changes in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets could reduce our earnings.The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using the two step approach. Testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is performed annually and involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events), including factors described herein, may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks.We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control material risks to which we are subject, including, for example, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and operational risk. If the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit and other risks may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, including when processes or technology change or new products and services are introduced. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Higher FDIC assessments could negatively impact profitability.FDIC insurance premiums are risk based and, accordingly, higher premiums are charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles, including increased construction and development and commercial and industrial lending, declining credit quality metrics, and increased brokered deposits and higher levels of borrowing. As a result, a decrease in the Bank’s capital ratios, or a negative evaluation by the FDIC, may increase the Bank’s net funding cost and reduce its earnings. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subjected to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments, which are determined in accordance with a defined calculation. The FDIC imposed a special assessment to recover the losses in connection with the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Increases in assessment rates or further special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our broker-dealer and advisory businesses subject us to a variety of risks associated with the securities industry. Our broker-dealer business subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including risks related to operationalizing internal controls and regulatory functions; our ability to retain key personnel; our ability to limit the outflow of deposits and successfully retain and manage assets; our ability to retain correspondents who may choose to perform their own clearing services, move their clearing business to one of our competitors or exit the business; and our ability to attract customers and generate new assets in areas not previously served. In addition, the broker-dealer business may subject us to risks related to the movement of equity prices. For example, if securities prices decline rapidly, the value of our collateral for margin and other positions could fall below the amount of the indebtedness secured by these securities, and in rapidly appreciating markets, our risk of loss may increase due to short positions. The securities lending and securities trading and execution businesses subject us to risk of loss if a counterparty fails to perform or if collateral securing the counterparty’s obligations is insufficient. In securities transactions generally, we may be subject to market risk during the period between the execution of a trade and its settlement. Significant failures by our customers, including correspondents, or clients to honor their obligations, or increases in their rates of default, together with insufficient collateral and reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, poor investment returns and declines in client assets, due to either general market conditions or under-performance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) of our investment products, may affect our 20ability to retain existing assets, prevent clients from transferring their assets out of products or their accounts, or inhibit our ability to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. Any such poor performance could adversely affect our advisory and custody business and the fees that we earn on client assets.Our broker-dealer and advisory businesses are also subject to regulatory requirements and risks discussed above under “Regulation of the Securities Business Segment” in “Supervision and Regulation” and “Our broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subject us to regulatory risks” herein. Our broker-dealer business exposes us to other risks and uncertainties that are common in the securities industry, including intense competition, and potentially new areas and types of litigation including lawsuits based on allegations concerning our correspondents or based upon the correspondent’s actions even though we do not control their activities. These actions may become more common or frequent, particularly if there is a prolonged decrease in equity prices resulting in investor losses. Allegations of violations of securities laws or FINRA rules, even if not ultimately asserted or proved, could substantially impact our results of operations and lead to reputational harm. The regulatory environment in which our broker-dealer business operates is subject to frequent change. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the U.S. Congress, the SEC, FINRA or other U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities. The business, financial condition and operating results of our broker-dealer business may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental and regulatory authorities. Our broker-dealer business is subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC, FINRA and various self-regulatory organizations. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to limitation of its activities, including suspension or revocation of its registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory bodies, and ultimately may require its liquidation. We are subject to stringent capital requirements and may need to raise additional capital in the future, and that capital may not be available or its cost may be high.We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. We may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could dilute existing stockholders’ interests in the Company.Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, our financial performance and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance on our ability to raise additional capital if needed or whether it can be raised on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, raising equity capital will have a dilutive effect on the equity interests of our existing stockholders and may cause our stock price to decline.Liquidity and access to adequate funding cannot be assured.Liquidity is essential to our business and the inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, equity and debt offerings, or other sources could have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity. The Bank may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Company specific factors such as a decline in our credit rating, an increase in the cost of capital from financial capital markets, a decrease in business activity due to adverse regulatory action or other company specific event, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence may impair our access to funding with acceptable terms adequate to finance our activities. General factors related to the financial services industry such as a severe disruption in financial markets, a decrease in industry expectations, or a decrease in business activity due to political or environmental events may impair our access to liquidity. Our ability to attract and maintain depositors during a time of actual or perceived distress or instability in the banking industry may be limited. Additionally, we may acquire brokered deposits, which may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits, and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. We rely primarily upon deposits and FHLB advances. Our ability to attract deposits could be negatively impacted by a public perception of our financial prospects or by increased deposit rates available at troubled institutions suffering from shortfalls in liquidity. The FHLB advances and the FRBSF discount window are subject to regulation and other factors beyond our control, including changes to FHLB’s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies. These factors may adversely affect the availability and pricing of advances to members such as the Bank. Selected sources of liquidity may become unavailable to the Bank if it were to no longer be considered “well-capitalized.”21A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies more generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of the Company or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities, thereby, potentially reducing our ability to generate earnings.Our inability to manage our growth or deploy assets profitably could harm our business and decrease our overall profitability, which may cause our stock price to decline.Our assets and deposit base have grown substantially in recent years, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow over time, perhaps significantly. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, including to, among other things: (i) improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls; (ii) maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; (iii) maintain sufficient levels of regulatory capital and liquidity; and (iv) expand our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base. In addition, acquiring other companies, asset pools or deposits may involve risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues, disruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management’s time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or execute integration efforts properly, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.In addition, we may not be able to sustain past levels of profitability as we grow, and our past levels of profitability should not be considered a guarantee or indicator of future success. If we are not able to maintain our levels of profitability by deploying deposits in profitable assets or investments, our net interest margin and overall level of profitability will decrease and our stock price may decline.New lines of business, purchased assets or liabilities or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.From time to time, we may implement new lines of business, purchase assets or liabilities or offer new products and services. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for such products and services are not fully developed. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, price and profitability targets may not prove feasible and customers may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, counterparty or third-party performance and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, a purchase of assets or liabilities or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business, purchasing of assets or liabilities and/or introducing new products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers.In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into certain transactions, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers, including financial statements, credit reports, tax returns and other financial information. We may also rely on representations from customers or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading information, financial statements, credit reports, tax returns or other financial information, including information falsely provided as a result of identity theft, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy.Our business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive. There is strong competition for customers from existing financial institutions. Technology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods rather than through banks. Consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions, such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and 22the related income generated from those deposits. Technology has also lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank, financial technology companies (“FinTechs”) to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. FinTechs continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services. Consumers have demonstrated a growing willingness to obtain banking services from FinTechs. As a result, our ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities, and to identify and develop new, value-added products for existing and future customers. Our competitors also include large, publicly-traded, internet-based banks, as well as smaller internet-based banks; “brick and mortar” banks, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online banking; and traditional banking institutions such as thrifts, finance companies, credit unions and mortgage banks. Some of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have broader name recognition and a more established customer base. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and leases and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which actions may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.To remain competitive, we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy. Our success depends on, among other things:•Having a large and increasing number of customers who use our bank for their banking needs;•Our ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel as our business grows;•Our ability to secure additional capital as needed;•The relevance of our products and services to customer needs and demands and the rate at which we and our competitors introduce or modify new products and services;•Our ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors;•The satisfaction of our customers with our customer service;•Ease of use of our websites and smartphone applications; •Our ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for financial services that provides us with reliable and effective operational, financial and information systems; and•Integration of our broker-dealer and registered investment-advisory businesses.If we are unable to implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand could hurt our ability to maintain or expand our customer base. The brand identities that we have developed will significantly contribute to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the “Axos” brands (including our other trade styles and trade names) is critical to expanding our customer base. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry for our “brick and mortar” competitors in the internet-based banking market. Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, product malfunctions, and trademark infringement. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands generally, or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.Reputational risk is inherent in our business. Negative publicity or reputational harm can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, illegal or unauthorized acts taken by third parties that supply products or services to us, the behavior of our employees, the customers with whom we have chosen to do business and negative publicity for other financial institutions. Negative publicity or information regarding our business and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, may be posted on social media or other Internet forums or published by news organizations. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity. Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and, particularly with respect to our broker-dealer and registered investment adviser businesses, could result in the imposition of new regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Any such damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.23We could be exposed to fraud risks that affect our operations and reputation.We face significant risks related to various types of fraud, including fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders and unauthorized transactions, which could result in financial loss, litigation, and damage to our reputation. We rely heavily on information provided by clients and third parties in conducting our business, and misrepresentations in this information can lead to funding loans that do not meet our expectations or on unfavorable terms. We bear the risk of loss associated with such misrepresentations, and it can be challenging to recover any monetary losses suffered. We have implemented various controls and security measures, but because of their inherent limitations, internal controls may not prevent or detect misrepresentations. Further, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect or mitigate fraud risks in a timely manner.Extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, rising sea levels, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events could harm our business.The potential impacts of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and rising sea levels, could impact our operations as well as those of our customers and third party vendors upon which we rely. Our Bank is based in San Diego, California, and approximately 35.8% of our real estate loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California at June 30, 2025. In addition, some of our computer systems that operate our internet websites and their back-up systems are located in San Diego, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and leases and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan and lease portfolio, which is substantially composed of real estate loans. Losses from disasters for which borrowers are uninsured or under-insured may reduce borrowers’ ability to repay mortgage loans. Natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events could each negatively impact our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers’ abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain standard business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events. The occurrence of natural disasters, particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, although the greater Los Angeles area fires in early 2025 did not have material impact to the Company.Our success depends in large part on the continuing efforts of key executives. If we are unable to retain these key personnel or attract, hire and retain others to oversee and manage our Company, our business could suffer.Our success depends substantially on the skill and abilities of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gregory Garrabrants, and other employees that perform multiple functions that might otherwise be performed by separate individuals at larger banks. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key employees, whether through termination of employment, disability, or other means, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our ability to grow and manage our growth depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled executive, technical, managerial, sales, marketing, customer service and professional personnel. The implementation of our business plan and our future success will depend on such qualified personnel. Competition for employees is intense in many areas of the financial services industry, and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract, onboard, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to risk of environmental liability with respect to properties to which we take title.In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, including commercial real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.24Technology Risks We rely on technology and information systems that may be disrupted, which would pose operational risks.We rely on technology and information systems for, among other things, communications, processing customer transactions, recordkeeping and financial controls. We rely substantially upon third-party service providers for our core banking and securities transactions technology and to protect us from system failures or disruptions. This reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Due to our interconnectivity with these third parties, we may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a cyber-attack or other privacy or information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. Our operations depend upon our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our products and services.We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws and regulations, such as the GLBA, which among other things requires privacy disclosures and maintenance of a robust security program. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and growing in complexity, and could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. The costs of compliance with these laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, reduce income from certain business initiatives, or result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems.Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information of our customers or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and results of operations. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.Misconduct by employees and third-party vendors could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential personal information. The Company may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Company to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.As nearly all of our products and services are smartphone and internet-based, the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing and will continue to increase. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our customers’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. System enhancements and updates may create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our technical layers of defense can create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we add more customers and expand the number of smartphone and internet-based products and services we offer.We have risks of systems failure and disruptions to operations.The computer systems, internet connectivity and network infrastructure utilized by us and others could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. This is true of both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect critical infrastructure against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunication failure, or other catastrophic events.25Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.If our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to information security incidents that degrade or deny the ability of customers to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Through our cybersecurity risk management program, we employ cybersecurity measures that are designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents, including management-level engagement and corporate governance, formalized risk management processes, advanced technical controls, incident response planning, frequent vulnerability testing, vendor management, intrusion monitoring, the maintenance of a security awareness program, and established partnerships with appropriate government and law enforcement agencies. These procedures cannot assure we will be fully protected from a cybersecurity incident. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other outside parties, employee error, failure to follow security procedures, malfeasance, or otherwise. As a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our customers’ data. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data. Other types of information security incidents may include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware or ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in the Company’s systems or the systems of third parties. Further, the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our service providers and others on whom we rely. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of any our third-party vendors occurs, such as hacking or identity theft, it could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to computers or systems, and may result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss and loss of confidence in our security measures. As a result, we could lose customers, suffer employee productivity losses, incur technology replacement and incident response costs, be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny, and be subject to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.We depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with existing and future technology needs, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.The development and use of AI present risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business.The banking and financial services industry continually experiences technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including recent and rapid developments in AI, including with agentic AI. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to assess the proper operation of AI models and capabilities to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also create service interruptions, transaction processing errors, and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased 26dependency on technology. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our revenue and profitability.We or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties may develop or incorporate AI technology in certain business processes, services or products. The development and use of AI presents a number of risks and challenges to our business. The legal and regulatory environment relating to AI is uncertain and rapidly evolving, both in the United States and internationally, and includes regulatory schemes targeted specifically at AI as well as provisions in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws applicable to the use of AI. These evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of AI technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that results in the release of private, confidential, or proprietary information, that reflects biases included in the data on which they are trained, that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, or that is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it challenging to understand why they are generating particular outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the AI models, reducing erroneous output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop, train and deploy their models, including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models, the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models and other matters over which we may have limited visibility. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures. We are also exposed to risks arising from the use of AI technologies by bad actors to commit fraud and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could create panic at a particular financial institution or exchange, which could pose a threat to financial stability.Risks Associated with our Common StockThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell their common stock when desired. Our common stock price may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors that may include the following:•actual or expected variations in quarterly results of operations;•recommendations by securities analysts;•operating and stock price performance of companies deemed comparable by investors;•news reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry;•perceptions in the marketplace about our Company or competitors;•new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;•significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by, or involving, our Company or competitors;•failure to integrate acquisitions or realize expected benefits from acquisitions;•changes in government regulations; •geopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism or military action; and•the other factors described herein.General market fluctuations; industry factors; political conditions; and general economic conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns, recessions, interest rate changes, changes in government tariff and trade policies; or credit loss trends, could cause our common stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware laws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.Provisions of our Certification of Incorporation, by-laws and Delaware laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:27•supermajority voting provisions providing that certain sections of our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws may not be amended or repealed by our stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power, and requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power to remove a director or directors and only for cause;•our classified Board of Directors, which may tend to discourage a third-party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us since the classification of our Board of Directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of directors;•advance notice provisions requiring stockholders seeking to nominate candidates to be elected as directors at an annual meeting or to bring business before an annual meeting to comply with the written procedure specified in our By-laws;•the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;•the ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws;•the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the additional shares of authorized common stock and preferred stock available for issuance under our Certificate of Incorporation, which could be issued at such times, under such circumstances and with such terms and conditions as to impede a change in control.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our Board of Directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.General Risk FactorsOur acquisitions involve integration and other risks.From time to time we undertake acquisitions of assets, deposits, lines of business and other companies consistent with our operating and growth strategies. Acquisitions generally involve a number of risks and challenges, including our ability to integrate the acquired operations and the associated internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations, our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired operations, our ability to limit the outflow of acquired deposits and successfully retain and manage acquired assets, our ability to attract new customers and generate new assets in areas not previously served, and the possible assumption of risks and liabilities related to litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the acquired operations. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquisitions would not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the acquired operations, that we would be able to compete effectively in the markets served by the acquired operations, or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from the transaction effectively. We also face the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or within the time period expected.As a public company, we face the risk of stockholder lawsuits and other related or unrelated litigation, particularly if we experience declines in the price of our common stock. We are subject to a variety of litigation pertaining to fiduciary and other claims and legal proceedings. Currently, there are certain legal proceedings pending against us in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, we believe any liabilities arising from pending legal matters have been adequately accounted for based on the probability of a charge. However, if actual results differ from our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a detailed discussion on current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - “Legal Proceedings.”Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in regulatory investigations or penalties, reduce investor confidence, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material 28weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or are required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation. Any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or restatement of our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and financial condition.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITYRisk Management and StrategyOur risk management processes and procedures include a cybersecurity risk management program as part of its multiple technical layers of defense. Through our cybersecurity risk management program, we have designed and implemented processes for identifying, assessing, preventing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats to our critical computer networks, third-party service providers, communication systems, hardware and software, and our critical data, including confidential company and customer information. As part of our cybersecurity risk management program, we evaluate our various technical layers of defense on an ongoing basis including performing incident response planning, frequent vulnerability testing, vendor risk management, intrusion monitoring, and maintaining a security awareness program. We invest in our people, processes and systems and collaborate with appropriate government and law enforcement agencies to help monitor cybersecurity threats as well as prevent and respond to cybersecurity incidents.We may utilize various resources that we deem necessary based on actual or potential threats and vulnerabilities to Axos, including engaging independent third-party assessors, consultants and/or auditors to help evaluate the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management program, processes, and controls.Our overall enterprise risk management includes a third-party risk management program, through which we identify, monitor, and manage cybersecurity risks inherent in or related to external service providers and other third parties. Through our business lines, we actively assess and oversee our third-party service providers against requirements set by our third-party risk management program and our cybersecurity risk management program.We have not identified any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected Axos or its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we face ongoing cybersecurity risks which may materially affect the Company in the future. Refer to the Risk Factors section for additional information.GovernanceCybersecurity risk management is part of our Board of Directors’ general oversight function, which includes oversight of
the cybersecurity risk management program and any identified cybersecurity risks and incidents. To facilitate its oversight, the Board of Directors receives regular updates from management on cybersecurity. Our Chief Risk Officer has primary responsibility for our enterprise risk management program. Our Chief Information Security Officer has primary responsibility for our cybersecurity risk management program and supervises the Company’s cybersecurity personnel. Both individuals have extensive work experience in various roles involving risk and compliance, including cybersecurity and information security.The individuals involved in our cybersecurity risk management program are informed about developments in cybersecurity risks and related matters through a variety of channels inside the Company, including but not limited to, briefings from internal teams and alerts and reports produced by various measures we may deploy, as well as information obtained from external sources in the government and private sector, including external third party consultants retained by Axos.Our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Risk Officer report information on cybersecurity risks to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur principal offices are located at 9205 West Russell Road, Suite 400, Las Vegas, NV 89148. Our Banking Business Segment and Securities Business Segments both conduct business at this location. Among other additional locations, we have office space located in San Diego, California totaling approximately 163,528 square feet.29ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe may from time to time become a party to other claims or litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims to enforce liens, claims involving the origination and servicing of loans, and other issues related to the Company’s operations. None of such matters are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or business.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AX”. There were 56,486,144 shares of common stock outstanding as of August 8, 2025 held by approximately 59,000 holders of record. A substantially larger number of holders of our common stock are beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by brokers and other financial institutions. The transfer agent and registrar of our common stock is Computershare. DIVIDENDSWe intend to retain any earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and common stock repurchases. Our Board of Directors has never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends, should our Board of Directors elect to do so, depends largely upon the ability of our subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends to us. Future dividends will depend primarily upon our earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as government policies and regulations applicable to us and our bank that limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval.ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESCommon Stock Repurchases. On April 27, 2023, the Company announced a program to repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock and on each of February 12, 2024 and May 12, 2025, the Company announced an additional $100 million increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company may repurchase shares on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate, at the discretion of the Company, and subject to its assessment of alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, general market conditions and regulatory factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The share repurchase program will continue in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company. Shares of common stock repurchased under this plan will be held as treasury shares. During fiscal year 2025 the Company repurchased a total of $58.5 million or 951,927 common shares at an average price of $61.40 per share and there remains $148.1 million of availability under the program as of June 30, 2025. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Settlement of Restricted Stock Unit Awards. The Company’s amended and restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, permits net settlement of stock issuances related to equity awards for purposes of payment of a grantee’s minimum income tax obligation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OVERVIEWThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Axos Financial, Inc. (“Axos”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Axos Bank (the “Bank” or “Axos Bank”) and Axos Nevada Holding, LLC (“Axos Nevada Holding”), collectively, the “Company.” Axos, the Bank, three lending-related entities and Axos Nevada Holding comprise substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. The Bank, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and the activities of three lending-related entities, constitute the Banking Business Segment. Axos Nevada Holding owns Axos Securities, LLC, which owns Axos Clearing LLC (“Axos Clearing”), a clearing broker-dealer, Axos Invest, Inc., a registered investment advisor, and Axos Invest LLC, an introducing broker-dealer. Axos Securities, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries constitute the Securities Business Segment. Axos Bank provides consumer and business banking products through its low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. Axos Clearing and Axos Invest LLC, provide comprehensive securities clearing services to introducing broker-dealers and registered investment advisor correspondents and digital investment advisory services to retail investors, respectively. Axos Financial, Inc.’s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “AX” and is a component of the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P SmallCap 600® Index, among other indices.MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONSFrom time to time, we undertake acquisitions or similar transactions consistent with our operating and growth strategies. On August 23, 2023, the Company acquired approximately $52 million of marine floor financing loans at par value along with other assets for an additional $2 million, primarily consisting of servicing rights as well as certain employees. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and such assets are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.On December 7, 2023, the Company acquired from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) two loan portfolios, comprising both purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) and non-PCD loans, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $1.3 billion at a fair value of $901.5 million, reflecting a non-credit-related discount of $306.8 million and an allowance for credit losses on PCD loans of $70.1 million, (the “FDIC Loan Purchase”). Also included in the acquisition were certain related interest rate derivative assets and liabilities with a fair value of $109.0 million and $104.4 million, respectively, as of the date of the acquisition and whose maturities generally align with those of the loans acquired. The acquisition of the non-PCD loans and interest rate derivatives was accounted for as a purchase of financial assets and liabilities, and the Company recognized a $92.4 million gain on the transaction included in “Gain on acquisition” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no other significant acquisitions undertaken during fiscal years 2025, 2024 or 2023.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods.Critical accounting estimates are those that we consider most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates that are inherently uncertain. We have identified critical accounting policies and estimates below. In addition, these critical accounting estimates are discussed further in Note 1—“Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Consolidated Financial Statements.34Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for its held-for-investment loan and net investment in leases portfolio as well as lending commitments, excluding loans measured at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which represents management’s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses on the loans and net investment in leases. The estimate of the allowance for credit losses includes both a quantitative and qualitative assessment, both of which include variables that are subject to uncertainty.The quantitative assessment reflects modeled outputs utilizing economic scenarios and forecasts, which are subject to uncertainty, and is also based on the Company’s current and expected future economic outlook. Key economic variables considered in the quantitative assessment include factors such as the U.S. unemployment rate and interest rates, both of which impact the default rate of the loan pools. Additionally, the results of the quantitative assessment are impacted by the third-party macroeconomic forecasts across various economic scenarios. The Company periodically reviews and adjusts the weighting of scenarios based on management’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) framework. Adjustment of scenario weighting away from the baseline scenario to the adverse scenario should increase the allowance for credit losses on the Company’s held-for-investment loan and net investment in leases portfolio, all else remaining equal. Economic forecasts that impacted management’s assessment of scenario weightings included interest rates, inflation, changes in trade policies, and geopolitical unrest. Changes in one or more of these variables can cause a significant change in the estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, management performs a qualitative assessment to address inherent limitations in the model and data. Qualitative criteria used in the assessment, as outlined in Note 1—“Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Consolidated Financial Statements, can require significant judgment and is subject to uncertainty.For further information on the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1—“Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5—“Loans & Allowance for Credit Losses” in the Consolidated Financial Statements.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share, and tangible book value per common share. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious as to their reliance on such measures. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, and our management uses these measures when it internally evaluates the performance of our business and makes operating decisions. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures.We define “adjusted earnings,” a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income without the after-tax impact of non-recurring acquisition-related items (including amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and certain gains and provisions resulting from the Company’s FDIC Loan Purchase), and other costs (unusual or non-recurring charges). Adjusted earnings per diluted common share (“adjusted EPS”) is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted earnings by the average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period. We believe the non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings and 35adjusted EPS provide useful information about the Company’s operating performance. We believe excluding the non-recurring acquisition-related costs, and other costs provides investors with an alternative understanding our core business.Below is a reconciliation of net income and diluted EPS, the nearest comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP): For Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)202520242023Net income$432,908 $450,008 $307,165 FDIC Loan Purchase - Gain on purchase— (92,397)— FDIC Loan Purchase - Provision for credit losses— 4,648 — Acquisition-related costs 7,408 10,843 10,948 Other costs1(1,878)— 16,000 Income tax effect(1,627)22,446 (7,776)Adjusted earnings (Non-GAAP)436,811 395,548 326,337 Average dilutive common shares outstanding58,241,42158,725,63660,566,854Diluted EPS$7.43 $7.66 $5.07 FDIC Loan Purchase - Gain on purchase— (1.57)— FDIC Loan Purchase - Provision for credit losses— 0.08 — Acquisition-related costs0.13 0.18 0.18 Other costs1(0.03)— 0.27 Income tax effect$(0.03)$0.39 $(0.13)Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP)$7.50 $6.74 $5.39 1Other costs for the fiscal year ended 2025 primarily reflects the payment of a legal judgment at an amount less than previously accrued and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 reflects the original accrual for such legal judgment.We define “tangible book value,” a non-GAAP financial measure, as book value adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated using common stockholders’ equity minus servicing rights, goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible book value by the common shares outstanding at the end of the period. We believe tangible book value per common share is useful in evaluating the Company’s capital strength, financial condition, and ability to manage potential losses.Below is a reconciliation of total stockholders’ equity, the nearest comparable GAAP measure, to tangible book value (Non-GAAP) as of the dates indicated: At the Fiscal Years Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)202520242023Common stockholders’ equity$2,680,677 $2,290,596 $1,917,159 Less: servicing rights, carried at fair value27,218 28,924 25,443 Less: goodwill and intangible assets—net134,502 141,769 152,149 Tangible common stockholders’ equity (Non-GAAP)$2,518,957 $2,119,903 $1,739,567 Common shares outstanding at end of period56,483,617 56,894,565 58,943,035 Book value per common share$47.46 $40.26 $32.53 Less: servicing rights, carried at fair value per common share$0.48 $0.51 $0.44 Less: goodwill and other intangible assets—net per common share$2.38 $2.49 $2.58 Tangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP)$44.60 $37.26 $29.51 36FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSThe following selected consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included elsewhere in this report.At or for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)202520242023Selected Balance Sheet Data:Total assets$24,783,078 $22,855,334 $20,348,469 Loans—net of allowance for credit losses21,049,610 19,231,385 16,456,728 Loans held for sale, carried at fair value10,012 16,482 23,203 Allowance for credit losses290,049 260,542 166,680 Trading securities649 353 758 Available-for-sale securities66,008 141,611 232,350 Securities borrowed139,396 67,212 134,339 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables252,720 240,028 374,074 Total deposits20,829,543 19,359,217 17,123,108 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank60,000 90,000 90,000 Borrowings, subordinated debentures and other borrowings312,671 325,679 361,779 Securities loaned139,426 74,177 159,832 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing payables350,606 301,127 445,477 Total stockholders’ equity2,680,677 2,290,596 1,917,159 Selected Income Statement Data:Interest and dividend income$1,815,465 $1,655,607 $1,157,138 Interest expense687,693 694,178 374,017 Net interest income1,127,772 961,429 783,121 Provision for credit losses55,745 32,500 24,250 Net interest income, after provision for credit losses1,072,027 928,929 758,871 Non-interest income131,066 222,660 120,488 Non-interest expense589,698 516,108 447,615 Income before income tax expense613,395 635,481 431,744 Income taxes180,487 185,473 124,579 Net income$432,908 $450,008 $307,165 Per Common Share Data:Net income:Basic$7.61 $7.82 $5.15 Diluted$7.43 $7.66 $5.07 Adjusted earnings per common share (Non-GAAP1)$7.50 $6.74 $5.39 Book value per common share$47.46 $40.26 $32.53 Tangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP1)$44.60 $37.26 $29.51 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding:Basic56,862,630 57,509,029 59,691,541 Diluted58,241,421 58,725,636 60,566,854 Common shares outstanding at end of period56,483,617 56,894,565 58,943,035 Common shares issued at end of period71,101,642 70,221,632 69,465,446 37At or for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)202520242023Performance Ratios and Other Data:Growth in loans held for investment, net$1,818,225 $2,774,657 $2,365,667 Loan originations for sale$199,845 $197,305 $160,607 Return on average assets1.82 %2.08 %1.64 %Return on average common stockholders’ equity17.30 %21.64 %17.22 %Interest rate spread23.97 %3.62 %3.44 %Net interest margin34.90 %4.62 %4.35 %Net interest margin -

loans to nonaccrual loans as of June 30, 2025 is primarily attributable to the change in nonaccrual loans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur results of operations depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income is subject to competitive factors in online banking and other markets. Our net interest income is reduced by our current estimate of credit losses. We earn non-interest income primarily from mortgage banking activities, banking products and service activity, asset custody services, broker-dealer clearing and related services, prepayment fee income from multifamily and commercial borrowers who repay their loans before maturity and from gains on sales of other loans and available-for-sale securities. Losses on sales of available-for-sale securities reduce non-interest income. The largest component of non-interest expense is salary and benefits, which is a function of the number of personnel, which increased to 1,989 full-time employees at June 30, 2025, from 1,781 full-time employees at June 30, 2024. We are subject to federal and state income taxes, and our effective tax rates were 29.42%, 29.19% and 28.85% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Other factors that affect our results of operations include expenses relating to data and operational processing, advertising, depreciation, occupancy, professional services, and other miscellaneous expenses.38AVERAGE BALANCES, NET INTEREST INCOME, YIELDS EARNED AND RATES PAIDThe following table presents information regarding (i) average balances; (ii) the total amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the weighted-average yields on such assets; (iii) the total amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the weighted-average rates paid on such liabilities; (iv) net interest income; (v) interest rate spread; and (vi) net interest margin:For the Fiscal Years Ended June 30,202520242023(Dollars in thousands)AverageBalance1InterestIncome /ExpenseAverageYieldsEarned /Rates

The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to each based on the relative changes attributable to volume and changes attributable to rate.Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2025 vs 2024Increase (Decrease) Due to(Dollars in thousands)VolumeRateTotalIncrease(Decrease)Increase (decrease) in interest income:Loans$153,412 $1,800 $155,212 Non-purchased loans83,831 5,107 88,938 Purchased loans69,581 (3,307)66,274 Interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions21,319 (14,107)7,212 Mortgage-backed and other securities(5,237)(816)(6,053)Securities borrowed and margin lending1,046 2,039 3,085 Stock of the regulatory agencies737 (335)402 Total increase (decrease) in interest income$171,277 $(11,419)$159,858 Increase (decrease) in interest expense:Interest-bearing demand and savings$75,720 $(69,479)$6,241 Time deposits(8,225)(833)(9,058)Securities loaned(624)240 (384)Advances from the FHLB(827)(608)(1,435)Borrowings, subordinated notes and debentures(1,288)(561)(1,849)Total increase (decrease) in interest expense$64,756 $(71,241)$(6,485)Interest Income. For fiscal year 2025, interest income increased $159.9 million, or 9.7%, compared to interest income in fiscal year 2024, primarily reflecting higher interest earned on loans, mainly attributable to higher loan balances.Interest Expense. For fiscal year 2025, interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 0.9% compared to interest expense in fiscal year 2024, primarily attributable to lower rates on interest bearing demand and savings deposits and lower average time deposits, advances from the FHLB, and other borrowings. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest-bearing demand and savings deposit balances.Provision for Credit Losses. For fiscal year 2025, provision for credit losses increased $23.2 million compared to the provision for credit losses in fiscal year 2024. See “Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans” for discussion of our allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses.Non-interest Income. The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest income:For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands)20252024Inc (Dec)Broker-dealer fee income$45,233 $48,136 $(2,903)Advisory fee income31,794 31,335 459 Banking and service fees38,195 35,723 2,472 Mortgage banking and servicing rights income13,007 10,000 3,007 Prepayment penalty fee income2,837 5,069 (2,232)Gain on acquisition— 92,397 (92,397)Total non-interest income$131,066 $222,660 $(91,594)For fiscal year 2025, non-interest income decreased $91.6 million, or 41.1% compared to non-interest income in fiscal year 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of the absence of the gain on the FDIC Loan Purchase as compared to fiscal year 2024, as well as a decrease in broker-dealer fee income on lower rates earned on cash sorting balances. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking and servicing rights income, reflecting net gains on loan sales in fiscal year 2025, and higher banking and service fees.40Non-interest Expense. The following table sets forth information regarding our non-interest expense for the periods shown:For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands)20252024Inc (Dec)Salaries and related costs$297,955 $250,873 $47,082 Data and operational processing80,433 69,370 11,063 Depreciation and amortization29,019 27,086 1,933 Advertising and promotional47,760 42,797 4,963 Professional services37,572 36,532 1,040 Occupancy and equipment17,705 16,704 1,001 FDIC and regulatory fees27,558 20,546 7,012 Broker-dealer clearing charges17,065 18,260 (1,195)General and administrative expense34,631 33,940 691 Total non-interest expense$589,698 $516,108 $73,590 For fiscal year 2025, non-interest expense increased $73.6 million, or 14.3%, compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily due to increases of:•$47.1 million in salaries and related costs primarily due to increased headcount and salaries to support continued growth in the business;•$11.1 million in data and operational processing expense to support the Company’s growth and continued investments in technology; and•$7.0 million in FDIC and regulatory fees primarily due to higher FDIC assessments, reflecting growth in deposits as well as special assessments in response to failures of other financial institutions.Income Tax Expense. For fiscal year 2025, income tax expense decreased $5.0 million, or 2.7% compared to income tax expense in fiscal year 2024. The fiscal year 2025 effective tax rate of 29.42%, increased by 0.23% compared to fiscal year 2024. The Company received federal and state tax credits for both fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. These tax credits decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.43% and 0.58%, respectively. Additionally, in June 2025, the State of California adopted its fiscal year 2026 budget, which, among other things, changed the way financial institutions’ multi-state income is apportioned to the State of California. The change required the Company to remeasure its California deferred tax asset and resulted in
revaluation of $5.5 million recognized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. The Company estimates the effective tax rate for fiscal years under this tax law will be reduced by approximately 3% compared to the effective tax rate prior to the change in the State of California tax law. SEGMENT RESULTSThe Company determines reportable segments based on the services offered, the significance of the services offered, the significance of those services to the Company’s financial condition and operating results and management’s regular review of the operating results of those services. The Company operates through two operating segments: the Banking Business Segment and the Securities Business Segment. In order to reconcile the two segments to the consolidated totals, the Company includes parent-only activities and intercompany eliminations. Inter-segment transactions are eliminated in consolidation and primarily include non-interest income earned by the Securities Business Segment and non-interest expense incurred by the Banking Business Segment for cash sorting fees related to deposits sourced from Securities Business Segment customers. The following tables present the operating results of the segments: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)Banking Business SegmentSecurities Business SegmentCorporate/EliminationsAxos ConsolidatedNet interest income$1,114,173 $28,431 $(14,832)$1,127,772 Provision for credit losses55,745 — — $55,745 Non-interest income46,430 119,138 (34,502)$131,066 Non-interest expense473,545 114,627 1,526 $589,698 Income (loss) before taxes$631,313 $32,942 $(50,860)$613,395 41Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024(Dollars in thousands)Banking Business SegmentSecurities Business SegmentCorporate/EliminationsAxos ConsolidatedNet interest income$950,832 $26,207 $(15,610)$961,429 Provision for credit losses32,500 — — $32,500 Non-interest income139,071 129,020 (45,431)$222,660 Non-interest expense418,695 115,091 (17,678)$516,108 Income (loss) before taxes$638,708 $40,136 $(43,363)$635,481 Banking Business SegmentFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, Banking Business Segment had pre-tax income of $631.3 million compared to pre-tax income of $638.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the decrease in pre-tax income was primarily related to the absence of the gain on the FDIC Loan Purchase as compared to fiscal year 2024 and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income.For the fiscal year 2025, the Banking Business Segment’s net interest income increased $163.3 million, or 17.2%, compared to net interest income in fiscal year 2024. The increase in net interest income is reflective of higher interest earned on loans, mainly attributable to higher loan balances, as well as lower rates on demand and savings deposits and lower average time deposits and advances from the FHLB. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest-bearing demand and savings deposit balances.For the fiscal year 2025, the Banking Business Segment’s non-interest income decreased $92.6 million, or 66.6%, compared to non-interest income in fiscal year 2024. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily the result of the absence of the gain on the FDIC Loan Purchase as compared to fiscal year 2024.For the fiscal year 2025, the Banking Business Segment’s non-interest expense increased $54.9 million, or 13.1%, compared to non-interest expense in fiscal 2024. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by higher salaries and related costs.We consider the ratios shown in the table below to be key indicators of the performance of our Banking Business Segment:Fiscal Year EndedJune 30, 2025June 30, 2024Efficiency ratio40.80 %38.42 %Return on average assets2.02 %2.20 %Interest rate spread4.03 %3.66 %Net interest margin4.95 %4.68 %Our Banking Business Segment’s net interest margin exceeds our consolidated net interest margin. Our consolidated net interest margin includes certain items that are not reflected in the calculation of our net interest margin within our Banking Business Segment and reduce our consolidated net interest margin, such as the borrowing costs at the Company and the yields and costs associated with certain items within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in our Securities Business Segment, including those related to securities financing operations.42Securities Business SegmentFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, our Securities Business Segment had income before taxes of $32.9 million compared to income before taxes of $40.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. For the fiscal year 2025, the Securities Business Segment’s net interest income increased $2.2 million, or 8.5%, compared to fiscal year 2024, resulting from higher net interest income earned in securities lending activities and lower interest expense on borrowings. In the Securities Business Segment, interest is earned through margin loan balances, securities borrowed and cash deposit balances. Interest expense is incurred from cash borrowed through bank lines and securities lending.For the fiscal year 2025, the Securities Business Segment’s non-interest income decreased $9.9 million, or 7.7%, compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily attributable to lower broker-dealer fee income on lower rates earned on cash sorting balances.For the fiscal year 2025, the Securities Business Segment’s non-interest expense decreased $0.5 million, or 0.4%, compared to non-interest expense in fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, primarily related to lower broker-dealer clearing charges.Selected information concerning Axos Clearing follows as of each date indicated:June 30,(Dollars in thousands)20252024FDIC insured program balances at banks$1,444,830 $1,289,105 Margin balances$229,387 $219,848 Cash reserves for the benefit of customers$146,835 $113,676 Securities lending:Interest-earning assets – stock borrowed$139,396 $67,212 Interest-bearing liabilities – stock loaned$139,426 $74,177 COMPARISON OF THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024 AND JUNE 30, 2023 For a comparison of our fiscal year 2024 results compared to fiscal year 2023 results, see Part II, Item 7, “Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC.FINANCIAL CONDITIONOur total assets increased $1.9 billion, or 8.4%, to $24.8 billion, as of June 30, 2025, up from $22.9 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase in total assets primarily reflects growth in total loans of $1.8 billion on a net basis, driven by increases in the commercial & industrial - non-RE and commercial real estate portfolios. Total liabilities increased by $1.5 billion or 7.5%, to $22.1 billion at June 30, 2025, up from $20.6 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflects growth in deposits of $1.5 billion. Stockholders’ equity increased by $390.1 million, or 17.0%, to $2.7 billion at June 30, 2025, up from $2.3 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase in stockholders’ equity primarily reflects net income of $432.9 million, partially offset by repurchases of $58.5 million of common stock.Loan Portfolio Composition.

Our primary sources of liquidity include deposits, borrowings, payments and maturities of outstanding loans, sales of loans, maturities or sales of available-for-sale securities and other short-term investments. While scheduled loan payments and maturing available-for-sale securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We generally invest excess funds in overnight deposits and other short-term interest-earning assets. We use cash generated through retail deposits, our largest funding source, to offset the cash utilized in lending and investing activities. Our short-term interest-earning available-for-sale securities are used to provide liquidity for lending and other operational requirements. Axos Bank can borrow up to 35% of its total assets from the FHLB. Borrowings are collateralized by pledging certain mortgage loans and available-for-sale securities to the FHLB. Based on loans and securities pledged at June 30, 2025, we had $2,799.2 million available immediately and an additional $4,925.6 million available with additional collateral and the Company had $4,284.7 million of loans and $127 thousand of securities pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2025, we had $250.0 million in unsecured federal funds lines of credit with five major banks under which there were no borrowings outstanding.The Bank has the ability to borrow short-term from the FRBSF Discount Window. At June 30, 2025, the Bank did not have any borrowings outstanding and the amount available from this source was $7,046.5 million. Borrowings are collateralized by pledging commercial loans and consumer loans. At June 30, 2025, the Bank had $8,227.7 million of loans pledged to the FRBSF.Any future borrowings will depend on the growth of our lending operations and our exposure to interest rate risk, among other factors. We expect to continue to use deposits and advances from the FHLB as the primary sources of funding our future asset growth.Axos Clearing has a $150.0 million third-party secured line of credit available for borrowing. As of June 30, 2025, there was no amount outstanding. These credit facilities bear interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and borrowings are due upon demand.Axos Clearing has a $110.0 million unsecured line of credit available for limited purpose borrowing. As of June 30, 2025, there was no amount outstanding. This credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and borrowings are due upon demand. The unsecured line of credit requires Axos Clearing to operate in accordance with specific covenants with respect to capital and debt ratios. Axos Clearing was in compliance with all covenants as of June 30, 2025.48In December 2004, we completed a transaction that resulted in the issuance of $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures for our Company with a stated maturity date of February 23, 2035. We have the right to redeem the debentures in whole (but not in part) on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest through the redemption date. Interest accrues at the rate of three-month term SOFR plus a 2.41% margin and a 0.26% spread adjustment, for a rate of 6.99% as of June 30, 2025, with interest paid quarterly.In January 2019, we issued subordinated loans totaling $7.5 million to the principal stockholders of Cor Securities Holdings, Inc. (“COR Securities”) in an equal principal amount, with a maturity of 15 months and a 6.25% interest rate, to serve as the source of payment of indemnification obligations of the principal stakeholders of COR Securities under the applicable merger agreement. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, $0.1 million of subordinated loans were repaid. As of June 30, 2025, an indemnification claim against the $7.4 million remains pending.In September 2020, the Company completed the sale of $175 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The 2030 Notes mature on October 1, 2030 and accrue interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.875%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2021. From and including October 1, 2025, to, but excluding October 1, 2030 or the date of early redemption, the 2030 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the three-month term SOFR plus a spread of 476 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on January 2026. The 2030 Notes may be redeemed on or after October 1, 2025, which date may be extended at the Company’s discretion, at a redemption price equal to principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain conditions. On September 27, 2024, the Company paid $9.2 million to repurchase $9.5 million par value of its 4.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 1, 2030 resulting in a pre-tax non-cash gain on extinguishment of $0.2 million, after accounting for unamortized issuance costs and accrued interest. The non-cash gain is recorded in “General and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.In February 2022, the Company completed the sale of $150 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the “2032 Notes”). The 2032 Notes are obligations only of Axos Financial, Inc. The 2032 Notes mature on March 1, 2032 and accrue interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.00%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2022. From and including March 1, 2027, to, but excluding March 1, 2032 or the date of early redemption, the 2032 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month term SOFR plus a spread of 227 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2027. The 2032 Notes may be redeemed on or after March 1, 2027, which date may be extended at the Company’s discretion, at a redemption price equal to principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain conditions. Fees and costs incurred in connection with the debt offering amortize to interest expense over the term of the 2032 Notes. On July 15, 2024, the Company paid $2.6 million to repurchase $3.0 million par value of its 4.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 1, 2032 resulting in a pre-tax non-cash gain on extinguishment of $0.4 million, after accounting for unamortized issuance costs and accrued interest. On June 5, 2025, the Company paid $1.4 million to repurchase $1.5 million par value of its 2032 Notes resulting in a pre-tax non-cash gain on extinguishment of $0.1 million, after accounting for unamortized issuance costs and accrued interest. The non-cash gain is recorded in “General and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. In February 2024, the Company filed a new shelf registration with the SEC which allows us to issue up to $500.0 million through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and units. On January 28, 2025, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell through distribution agents from time to time shares of the Company’s common stock in at-the-market offerings with an aggregate offering price of up to $150,000,000. The Company will issue the stock pursuant to the registration statement filed in February 2024 and a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on January 28, 2025. No shares of the Company’s common stock have been issued pursuant to this offering.We view our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate for our anticipated needs and contingencies for both the short and long-term. Due to the diversified sources of our deposits, while maintaining approximately 90% of our total Bank deposits in insured or collateralized accounts as of June 30, 2025, we believe we have the ability to increase our level of deposits, and have available other potential sources of funding, to address our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.For additional information on certain contractual and other obligations, see Note 9—“Other Assets,” Note 11—“Deposits,” Note 12—“Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank,” Note 13—“Borrowings, Subordinated Debt and Debentures” and Note 18—“Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Activities” in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for further information on pending litigation.49The Company and Bank Capital Requirements. Our Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for our Company and the OCC has similar requirements for our Bank. The following tables present regulatory capital information for our Company and Bank. Information presented for June 30, 2025, reflects the Basel III capital requirements for both our Company and Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our Company and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.Quantitative measures established by regulation require our Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require our Company and Bank maintain minimum ratios of core capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. To be “well capitalized,” our Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Additionally, the Bank is required to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to at least 1.5% of total average adjusted assets. At June 30, 2025, our Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject to and were “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since June 30, 2025 that would materially adversely change the Company’s and Bank’s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support our Company’s and Bank’s further growth and to maintain their “well capitalized” status.The Company and Bank both elected the five-year CECL transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital and ratios. The amounts in the following table reflect this election. This guidance allowed an entity to add back to regulatory capital 100% of the impact of the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25% of the subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2022. In fiscal year 2025, this cumulative amount was phased out of regulatory capital at 75% and the cumulative amount will be 100% phased out of regulatory capital beginning in fiscal year 2026.The Company’s and Bank’s capital ratios and requirements were as follows:Minimum Capital RequirementMinimum Capital Requirement with Capital Buffer Minimum to Be Well CapitalizedJune 30,20252024Regulatory Capital Ratios (Company):Tier 1 leverage ratio10.73 %9.43 %4.00 %4.00 %N/ACommon equity tier 1 capital ratio12.52 %12.01 %4.50 %7.00 %N/ATier 1 risk-based capital ratio12.52 %12.01 %6.00 %8.50 %N/ATotal risk-based capital ratio15.28 %14.84 %8.00 %10.50 %N/ARegulatory Capital Ratios (Bank):Tier 1 leverage ratio10.23 %9.74 %4.00 %4.00 %5.00 %Common equity tier 1 capital ratio12.42 %12.74 %4.50 %7.00 %6.50 %Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio12.42 %12.74 %6.00 %8.50 %8.00 %Total risk-based capital ratio13.70 %13.81 %8.00 %10.50 %10.00 %Axos Clearing Capital Requirements. Pursuant to the net capital requirements of the Exchange Act, Axos Clearing, is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital (Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act). Under this rule, the Company has elected to operate under the alternate method and is required to maintain minimum net capital of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions, as defined. Under the alternate method, the Company may not repay subordinated debt, pay cash distributions, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.50The net capital position of Axos Clearing was as follows:(Dollars in thousands)June 30, 2025June 30, 2024Net capital$86,996 $101,462 Excess capital$81,834 $96,654 Net capital as a percentage of aggregate debit items33.71 %42.21 %Net capital in excess of 5% aggregate debit items$74,091 $89,442 Axos Clearing, as a clearing broker, is subject to SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act) which requires segregation of funds in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers (“Customer Reserve Bank Account”) and proprietary accounts of brokers (“PAB Reserve Account”). As of June 30, 2025, Axos Clearing was in compliance with its Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Account deposit requirements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk is defined as the sensitivity of income and capital to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices. The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates can have a variety of effects on our business. In particular, changes in interest rates affect our net interest income, net interest margin, net income, the value of our securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives, the volume of loans originated, and the amount of gain or loss on the sale of our loans.We are exposed to different types of interest rate risk. These risks include lag, repricing, basis, prepayment and lifetime cap risk, each of which is described in further detail below:Lag Risk and Repricing Risk. Lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of our adjustable rate assets and our liabilities. Repricing risk is caused by the mismatch of repricing methods between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Lag risk and repricing risk can produce short-term volatility in our net interest income during periods of interest rate movements even though the effect of this lag generally balances out over time. One example of lag risk is the repricing of assets indexed to the monthly treasury average (“MTA”). The MTA index is based on a moving average of rates outstanding during the previous 12 months. A sharp movement in interest rates in a month will not be fully reflected in the index for 12 months resulting in a lag in the repricing of our loans and securities based on this index. We expect more of our interest-earning assets will mature or reprice within one year than will our interest-bearing liabilities, resulting in a one year positive interest rate sensitivity gap (the difference between our interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within one year and our interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within one year, expressed as a percentage of total interest-earning assets). For example, in a falling interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater decrease in its yield on assets relative to its cost on liabilities, and thus a decrease in its net interest income. If our interest-bearing liabilities lag in repricing is shorter, or reprices faster, than our interest-earning assets lag, then it would result in an increase to our net interest income.Basis Risk. Basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar repricing timing but repricing is based on different market interest rate indices. Our earning assets that reprice are directly tied to various indices, such as: U.S. Treasury, SOFR, Ameribor, Federal Funds (“Fed Funds”), Interest Rate on Excess Reserves (“IOER”) and Prime. Generally, our deposit rates are not directly tied to these same indices. A portion of the Bank’s deposits are based on administrative rates controlled by management and the remaining portion are directly tied to Fed Funds. Therefore, if liability-linked indices fall faster than asset-linked indices and there are no other changes in our asset/liability mix, our net interest income will likely increase due to basis risk.Prepayment Risk. Prepayment risk results from the right of customers to pay their loans prior to maturity. Generally, loan prepayments increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments. In addition, prepayment risk results from the right of customers to withdraw their time deposits before maturity. Generally, early withdrawals of time deposits increase during rising interest rate environments and decrease in falling interest rate environments. When estimating the future performance of our assets and liabilities, we make assumptions as to when and how much of our loans and deposits will be prepaid. If the assumptions prove to be incorrect, the asset or liability may perform differently than expected.Lifetime Cap Risk. Our adjustable rate loans have lifetime interest rate caps. In periods of rising interest rates, it is possible for the fully indexed interest rate (index rate plus the margin) to exceed the lifetime interest rate cap. This feature prevents the loan from repricing to a level that exceeds the cap’s specified interest rate, thus adversely affecting net interest income in periods of relatively high interest rates. On a weighted-average basis, our adjustable rate loans at June 30, 2025 had 51lifetime rate caps that were 519 basis points greater than their current stated note rates. If market rates rise by more than the interest rate cap, we will not be able to increase these loan rates above the interest rate cap.The principal objective of our asset/liability management is to manage the sensitivity of market value of equity (“MVE”) and net interest income to changing interest rates. Asset/liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility to oversee the administration of these policies to the Bank’s asset/liability committee (“ALCO”). The interest rate risk strategy currently deployed by ALCO is to primarily use on-balance sheet products for balance sheet hedging. ALCO makes adjustments to the overall MVE sensitivity by recommending investment and borrowing strategies. The management team then executes the recommended strategy by increasing or decreasing the duration of the investments and borrowings, resulting in the appropriate level of market risk the Board of Directors wants to maintain. Other examples of ALCO policies designed to reduce our interest rate risk include limiting the premiums paid to purchase mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities. This policy addresses mortgage prepayment risk by capping the yield loss from an unexpected high level of mortgage loan prepayments. At least once a quarter, ALCO members report to our Board of Directors the status of our interest rate risk profile.We measure interest rate sensitivity as the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that mature or contractually re-price within a given period of time. The difference, or the interest rate sensitivity gap, provides an indication of the extent to which an institution’s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive (or asset sensitive) when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and negative (or liability sensitive) when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. Absent any subsequent asset and liability actions by management, in a rising interest rate environment, an institution with a positive gap would be in a better position than an institution with a negative gap to invest in higher yielding assets or to have its asset yields adjusted upward, which would cause the yield on its assets to increase at a faster pace than the cost of its interest-bearing liabilities. Conversely, absent any subsequent asset and liability actions by management, during a period of falling interest rates, an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets reprice at a faster rate than one with a negative gap, which would tend to reduce the growth in its net interest income.52Banking Business SegmentThe following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that were outstanding at June 30, 2025 and the portions of each financial instrument that are expected to mature or reset interest rates in each future period:Term to Repricing, Repayment, or Maturity atJune 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)Six Months or LessOver Six Months Through One YearOver OneYearthroughFive YearsOver FiveYearsTotalInterest-earning assets:Cash and cash equivalents$2,005,060 $— $— $— $2,005,060 Mortgage-backed and other securities133,651 4,432 16,941 10,984 $66,008 Stock of regulatory agencies29,600 — — — $29,600 Loans214,885,635 1,645,693 4,370,650 147,632 $21,049,610 Loans held for sale10,012 — — — $10,012 Total interest-earning assets16,963,958 1,650,125 4,387,591 158,616 23,160,290 Non-interest-earning assets— — — — $828,458 Total assets$16,963,958 $1,650,125 $4,387,591 $158,616 $23,988,748 Interest-bearing liabilities:Interest-bearing deposits3$17,381,443 $313,606 $167,817 $— $17,862,866 Advances from the FHLB— — 60,000 — $60,000 Total interest-bearing liabilities17,381,443 313,606 227,817 — 17,922,866 Other non-interest-bearing liabilities— — — — $3,451,680 Stockholders’ equity— — — — $2,614,202 Total liabilities and equity$17,381,443 $313,606 $227,817 $— $23,988,748 Net interest rate sensitivity gap$(417,485)$1,336,519 $4,159,774 $158,616 $5,237,424 Cumulative gap$(417,485)$919,034 $5,078,808 $5,237,424 $5,237,424 Net interest rate sensitivity gap—as a % of total interest-earning assets(1.80)%5.77 %17.96 %0.68 %22.61 %Cumulative gap—as a % of total cumulative interest-earning assets(1.80)%3.97 %21.93 %22.61 %22.61 %1 Comprised of U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities and other securities. The table reflects contractual repricing dates.2 Loans includes loan premiums, discounts and unearned fees. The table reflects either contractual repricing dates or expected maturities. 3 The table assumes that the principal balances for demand deposit and savings accounts will reprice in the first year.The above table provides an approximation of the projected re-pricing of assets and liabilities at June 30, 2025 on the basis of contractual maturities, adjusted for anticipated prepayments of principal and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan and securities prepayment rates reflected are based on historical experience. For the non-maturity deposit liabilities, we use decay rates and rate adjustments based upon our historical experience. Actual repayments of these instruments could vary substantially if future experience differs from our historic experience.Although “gap” analysis is a useful measurement device available to management in determining the existence of interest rate exposure, its static focus as of a particular date makes it necessary to utilize other techniques in measuring exposure to changes in interest rates. For example, gap analysis is limited in its ability to predict trends in future earnings and makes no assumptions about changes in prepayment tendencies, deposit or loan maturity preferences or repricing time lags that may occur in response to a change in the interest rate environment.53The following table indicates the sensitivity of net interest income movements to parallel instantaneous shocks in interest rates for the 1-12 months’ and 13-24 months’ time periods. For purposes of modeling net interest income sensitivity the Bank assumes no growth in the balance sheet other than for retained earnings: As of June 30, 2025First 12 MonthsNext 12 Months(Dollars in thousands)Percentage Change from BasePercentage Change from BaseUp 200 basis points8.4 %14.5 %Up 100 Basis points4.2 %7.0 %Down 100 basis points(2.9)%(4.3)%Down 200 basis points(3.2)%(5.2)%We attempt to measure the effect market interest rate changes will have on the net present value of assets and liabilities, which is defined as market value of equity. We analyze the MVE sensitivity to an immediate parallel and sustained shift in interest rates derived from the underlying interest rate curves.The following table indicates the sensitivity of MVE to the interest rate movement as described above:As of June 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)Percentage Change from BaseUp 200 basis points3.8 %Up 100 basis points2.5 %Down 100 basis points(3.3)%Down 200 basis points(6.5)%The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of interest rates, asset prepayments (including replacing floating rate loan run-off with loans having similar spread and floor features), runoffs in deposits and changes in repricing levels of deposits to general market rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Furthermore, these computations do not take into account any actions that we may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates. Those actions include, but are not limited to, making changes in loan and deposit interest rates and changes in our asset and liability mix.Securities Business SegmentOur Securities Business Segment is exposed to market risk primarily due to its role as a financial intermediary in customer transactions, which may include purchases and sales of securities, securities lending activities, and in our trading activities, which are used to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. We are subject to the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, investor expectations and changes in credit ratings of the issuer.Our Securities Business Segment is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of generating interest-earning assets including customer and correspondent margin loans, and its securities borrowing activities. Our exposure to interest rate risk is also from our funding sources including customer and correspondent cash balances, bank borrowings and securities lending activities. Interest rates on customer and correspondent balances and securities produce a positive spread with rates generally fluctuating in parallel.With respect to securities held, our interest rate risk is managed by setting and monitoring limits on the size and duration of positions and on the length of time securities can be held. The majority of the interest rates on customer and correspondent margin loans are generally indexed and can vary daily. Our funding sources are generally short term with interest rates that can vary daily.Our Securities Business Segment is engaged in various brokerage and trading activities that expose us to credit risk arising from potential non-performance from counterparties, customers or issuers of securities. This risk is managed by setting and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, conducting periodic credit reviews of counterparties, reviewing concentrations of securities and conducting business through central clearing organizations.Collateral underlying margin loans to customers and correspondents, and with respect to securities lending activities, is marked to market daily and additional collateral is obtained or refunded, as necessary.54ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENot applicable.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, under supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of; our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:•Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;•Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and•Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 version). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 was effective.BDO USA, P.C. has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, as stated in their report dated August 21, 2025.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.55Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmStockholders and Board of DirectorsAxos Financial, Inc.Las Vegas, NevadaOpinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Axos Financial, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated August 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated August 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Allowance for credit lossesAs discussed in Note 5 to the Company’s consolidated financial statement, the Company reported an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) of $290,049 as of June 30, 2025. As described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the ACL methodology considers many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, when available, estimated defaults based on portfolio trends, changes in collateral values, portfolio composition and loan concentration, and current lending policies and the effects of any new policies.Management makes significant judgments regarding the weighting of the economic forecast scenarios within the Commercial Real Estate (including construction lending) and Commercial & Industrial loan portfolio segments including economic forecasts, which are subject to uncertainty and are based on the Company’s current and expected outlook. We identified the weighting of the economic forecast scenarios as a critical audit matter because of the significance of the ACL. Determining whether the weighting of the economic forecast scenarios was reasonable and supportable involved especially subjective and complex judgements. These assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort.The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:F-1•Testing the design and operating effectiveness of management’s controls over the weighting of economic forecast scenarios.•Evaluating the reasonableness of the weighting of economic forecast scenarios by assessing the magnitude and directional consistency of changes, or lack thereof, in the level of adjustments as compared to external information sources.•Assessing the reasonableness of management’s judgments in determining the economic forecast scenarios by evaluating contradictory evidence by performing a market analysis to evaluate the appropriateness of conclusions reached. /s/ BDO USA, P.C.We have served

POLICIESBasis of Presentation and Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axos Financial, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“Axos” or the “Company”). Axos Bank (the “Bank”), its wholly owned subsidiaries, the activities of three lending-related entities and certain other lending activity constitute the Banking Business Segment, and Axos Securities, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries constitute the Securities Business Segment. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of the Company’s financial statements. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Axos Financial, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 6, 1999 for the purpose of organizing and launching an internet-based savings bank. The Bank, which opened for business over the internet on July 4, 2000, is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), its primary regulator. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insures the Bank’s deposit accounts up to the maximum allowable amount. Axos Clearing LLC, a clearing broker dealer, is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Axos Invest, a platform through which digital investment advisory services are offered to retail investors, is regulated by the SEC and FINRA. Business. The Company provides banking and securities products and services to its customers through its online and low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. Deposit products are demand accounts, savings and money market accounts, and time deposits marketed to consumers and businesses. Lending products include residential single family mortgage, multifamily mortgage, commercial mortgage loans, loans secured by commercial real estate properties (“CRE”), loans secured by commercial assets and non-bank lenders (commercial & industrial - non-RE), auto and unsecured loans and other loans. The Bank’s lending business is primarily concentrated in California and New York and is subject to the general economic conditions of those states. Securities products and services generate interest and fee income by providing comprehensive securities clearing and custody services to introducing broker-dealers and registered investment advisor correspondents and digital investment advisory services to retail investors, respectively. Use of Estimates. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.Revenue Recognition. The Company accounts for certain revenue streams under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), which provides that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Certain non-interest income, such as deposit service fees, advisory fee income and broker-dealer clearing fees, are within the scope of ASC 606. Advisory Fee Income—Asset-Based Custody Fees and Asset-Based Fund Fees. Asset-based custody fees consist of custody fees, and other ancillary fees. Custody fees vary based on a percentage of average customer assets under custody. Other ancillary fees may be charged based on average customer assets or based on specific activity. Revenue is recognized over the period where assets are held as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Asset-based fund fees consist of 12b-1 and mutual fund shareholder services fees and are paid by mutual fund companies monthly or quarterly based on the underlying agreements. Asset-based fund fees are charged based on a percentage of client assets invested in certain funds. Revenue is calculated each month based on the average daily assets invested in particular funds. Revenue is recognized over the period where assets are invested in certain funds. The performance obligations relate to providing recordkeeping, stockholder and administration services to mutual fund companies and the obligations are satisfied upon the performance of such services. Revenue recognition is constrained until the amount of average assets invested in each fund is known.Broker-Dealer Clearing Fees. The Company earns revenues for executing, settling and clearing securities transactions for other broker-dealers on a fully disclosed basis. Trade execution and clearing services, when provided together, represent a single performance obligation as the services are not separately identifiable in the context of the contract. Revenues associated with combined trade execution and clearing services, as well as trade execution services on a standalone basis, are recognized at a point in time on trade-date. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is F-9when the underlying security or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. The Company also earns revenues for services which are separately identifiable and represent a distinct performance obligation which is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Certain clearing or other related fees represent a modification of the original contract as they are distinct services. All trade and execution services are priced at their standalone selling price. Clearing and other fees are generally deducted from the introducing brokers’ commissions on a monthly basis. Banking and Service Fees—Deposit Service Fees. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees (i.e., net fees earned on analyzed business and public checking accounts), monthly service fees, check orders, and other deposit account related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Check orders and other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied and related revenue recognized, when incurred. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts.Banking and Service Fees—Card Fees. Fees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit card income, ATM fees, merchant services income, and other service charges. Debit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company’s debit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Visa. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income mainly represents fees charged to merchants to process their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Other service charges include revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, and other services. The Company’s performance obligation for fees, exchange, and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month.Banking and Service Fees—Technology and Service Fees. Technology and service fees include bankruptcy trustee, fiduciary service income and technology fees. Technology fees primarily include those earned from business management and entertainment accounting and payroll software licenses as well as payroll processing fees. The performance obligation is satisfied as access to the licensed software is provided and upon the processing of payroll. Payment for software licenses and payroll processing is generally received in the month following the provision of service. Bankruptcy trustee and fiduciary service income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the monthly basis point fee and bank account service charges. The products and services provided to the trustee also provide a source of deposits to the Company. The performance obligation is satisfied when the deposits are determined at the end of each month. The expected value method is used to calculate and record the estimated revenue at the beginning of each month based on the amount of deposits. Fees are billed and collected on a monthly basis The following presents non-interest income, segregated by revenue streams in-scope and out-of-scope of ASC 606 for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands)202520242023Advisory fee income$31,794 $31,335 $28,324 Broker-dealer clearing fees22,233 20,643 21,903 Deposit service fees5,430 4,257 4,517 Card fees2,867 2,516 4,410 Technology and service fees3,465 5,890 6,107     Non-interest income (in-scope ASC 606)65,789 64,641 65,261     Non-interest income (out-of-scope ASC 606)65,277 158,019 55,227     Total non-interest income$131,066 $222,660 $120,488 Contract Balances. A contract asset or receivable is recognized if the Company performs a service or transfers a good in advance of receiving consideration. A contract liability is recognized if the Company receives consideration (or has the unconditional right to receive consideration) in advance of performance. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, the Company’s contract assets and liabilities were not considered material.Other Revenue Recognition.
Increases in the net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies, as well as insurance proceeds received, are recorded in non-interest income and are not subject to income taxes. Lending related income includes fees earned from gains or losses on the sale of loans, and letter of credit fees. Gain or loss on the sale of financial F-10assets is measured as the net assets received from the sale less the carrying amount of the loan sold. The net assets received from the sale represent the fair value of any assets obtained or liabilities incurred as part of the transaction, including but not limited to cash, servicing assets, retained securitization investments and recourse obligations. Net gain or loss on the sale of repossessed assets is calculated by comparing sales proceeds to the carrying amount of the asset, and the carrying amount of the asset is determined using the lower of cost or fair value approach.Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Bank’s cash, due from banks, money market mutual funds and federal funds sold, all of which have original maturities within 90 days, consist of cash and cash equivalents. The table below presents cash and cash equivalents based on non-interest-earning and interest-earning status.At June 30,(Dollars in thousands)20252024Non-interest-earning cash and cash equivalents$152,337 $66,563 Interest-earning cash and cash equivalents2,024,017 2,119,213 Total cash and cash equivalents$2,176,354 $2,185,776 Restricted Cash. Restricted cash includes qualified deposits in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of Axos Clearing customers in accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and other regulations. Restricted cash also includes certain other cash balances which are restricted as to the Company’s withdrawal or usage based upon the terms of the corresponding agreements.Securities. The Company classifies securities at the time of purchase depending on intent. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company intends to hold the securities until maturity, or as available for sale if the securities are not held for resale in the near term. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effects, reported as a separate component of “Other comprehensive income (loss)” on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Trading securities include assets held for resale in the near term, with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on securities sales are based on a comparison of sales proceeds and the amortized cost of the security sold using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recognized on the trade date. Interest income includes coupon interest and amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized or accreted using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates at the individual security level whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded which is limited by the difference between fair value and the amortized cost basis. The remaining change in fair value is recognized in “Other comprehensive income” on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses, if any, are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the available-for-sale security is confirmed as uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.Loans (including Direct Financing & Sales Type Leases). Loans that are held for investment are loans that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned interest, deferred purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and an allowance for credit loss - loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Premiums and discounts on loans purchased as well as loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method.Single Family - Mortgage & Warehouse. The Single Family - Mortgage & Warehouse portfolio segment primarily consists of two loan types: single family mortgage loans and single family warehouse lines of credit. The single family mortgage loans consist of loans secured by one-to-four family residences. The single family warehouse lines of credit enable F-11the mortgage originators to close loans in their own names and temporarily finance inventories of closed mortgage loans until they can be sold to an approved investor. The Company also originates home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans.Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage. The Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage portfolio segment consists of loans secured by multifamily real estate (more than four units) and commercial real estate. These loans are dependent on the cash flow capacity of the project and repayment of loans secured by properties frequently depends on their successful operation and management.Commercial Real Estate. The Commercial Real Estate portfolio segment consists of loans secured by commercial real estate properties (“CRE”) under a variety of structures that it classifies as commercial real estate. A few examples are as follows: Commercial Bridge to Sale, Commercial Bridge to Construction, Commercial Bridge to Refinance and Acquisition, Development, Construction and Lender Finance. CRE Loans are originated to businesses secured by first liens on single family, multifamily, condominium, office, retail, mixed-use, hospitality, undeveloped or to-be-redeveloped land. Repayment of CRE loans depends on the successful completion of the real estate transition project and permanent take-out.Commercial & Industrial - Non-Real Estate (Non-RE). The Commercial & Industrial - Non-Real Estate portfolio segment consists of lender finance loans, asset-based loans, leveraged cash flow loans, insurance premium finance, capital call facilities, equipment leases, and general commercial and industrial loans. These receivables are generally secured by commercial assets, including, but not limited to, receivables, inventory, equipment and uniform commercial code (“UCC”) all-asset filings.For commercial and industrial non-real estate, asset backed loans and line of credit term loans, the Company typically enters into a structured facility, under which it takes a senior lien position collateralized by the underlying assets at advance rates well below the collateral value. Leveraged cash flow loans provide financial sponsors the ability to finance acquisitions, management buy-outs, recapitalizations, debt refinancing and dividends/distributions. Such lending relies on free cash flow as the primary repayment source, and enterprise value as the secondary repayment source. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis and is included within the Loans, including fees, line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leases generally do not contain non-lease components. Commercial and industrial leases are primarily made based on the operating cash flows of the borrower or conversion of working capital assets to cash and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Auto and Consumer. The Auto and Consumer portfolio segment includes automobile loans and unsecured consumer loans, including account overdraft loans: Auto loans consist of prime and subprime loans to customers secured by new and used vehicles. The Company holds all of the auto loans originated and performs loan servicing functions for these loans. Auto loans carry a fixed interest rate and have terms that range from two to eight years. Certain auto loans are insured for credit losses through which the Company recognizes fee income in “Banking and service fees” in the Consolidated Statements of Income upon the receipt of insurance proceeds following the charge off of the loans. Any receivables related to these policies are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Consumer unsecured loans generally consist of fixed rate unsecured loans to well-qualified, individual borrowers. Loan terms that range between three to six years. Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) Loans. Purchased loans that reflect a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit since their origination are considered PCD. For PCD loans, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized in the allowance for credit losses on the date of acquisition. The initial amortized cost of PCD loans is determined by reducing the loans’ par value by the acquisition date estimate of expected credit losses with any difference between the resulting amount and the loans’ purchase price recorded as a non-credit-related discount. Subsequent changes in the initial estimate of expected credit losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.Loans Held for Sale. Agency loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value. Net unrealized gains and losses are recognized through mortgage banking income in the income statement. The Bank sells its mortgage loans with either servicing released or servicing retained depending upon market pricing. Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded as mortgage banking income, based on the difference between sales proceeds and carrying value. Non-agency loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option for Agency loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that the fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. For loans for which the fair value option has been elected, the Company amortizes premiums and discounts over the life of the loan and any origination fees or costs are recognized as incurred.F-12Loans that were originated with the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future (loans held for investment), but which have been subsequently designated as being held for sale for risk management or liquidity needs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value calculated using pools of loans with similar characteristics. Upon transfer, the Company assesses the collectability of the outstanding principal balance and may charge-off a portion of the loan as discussed further below in “Allowance for Credit Losses.” Following this assessment, any previously established ACL on the held for investment loan is reversed and the loan is transferred at amortized cost. If, following transfer to held for sale, the fair value of the loan is below its amortized cost a valuation allowance is established for the difference.There may be times when loans have been classified as held for sale and cannot be sold or the Company has the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or to maturity and the loans are transferred to held for investment. For loans transferred from the lower of cost or fair value held for sale classification, any valuation allowance is reversed upon transfer and the loan is transferred at amortized cost and is then assessed for any potential ACL. Allowance for Credit Losses. The ACL is a valuation account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and net investment in leases. Under ASC 326, amortized cost is the basis on which the ACL is determined. Amortized cost is principal outstanding, net of any purchase premiums and discounts and net of any deferred loan fees and costs. Loans are charged off against the ACL when the Company believes that collectability of at least some portion of outstanding principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are recorded as an increase to the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level needed to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life, considering the effects of prepayments, of the loan portfolio as of the reporting date. Determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires judgment by the Company about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As such, a future assessment of current conditions may require material adjustments to the allowance.The Company’s process for determining expected lifetime credit losses entails a portfolio, model-based approach utilizing loan level detail and requires consideration of a broad range of relevant information relating to historical loss experience, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company stratifies the full loan population into segments sharing similar characteristics to perform the evaluation of the credit loss collectively. The Company defines a loan portfolio segment as the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology to determine the allowance, which is generally based on similar risk attributes, including underlying collateral, as well as the Company’s methods for monitoring credit risk and other factors. The Company categorizes the loan portfolio into five segments: Single Family - Mortgage & Warehouse, Multifamily and Commercial Mortgage, Commercial Real Estate, including construction lending, Commercial & Industrial - Non-Real Estate and Auto & Consumer. For further information on these loan portfolio segments, see “Loans” herein.The method for estimating expected lifetime credit losses includes, among other things, the following main components: (1) The use of a probability of default (“PD”)/loss given default (“LGD”) model; (2) defining a number of economic scenarios across the benign to adverse spectrum; (3) a reasonable forecast period of 24 months for all loan segments; and (4) a reversion period of 12 months using a linear transition to historical loss rates for each loan pool. After the reversion period, the historical loss rate is applied over the remaining contractual life of loan. Reasonable forecast periods and reversion periods are subject to periodic review and may be adjusted based on the Company’s view of current economic conditions. The results of the estimate are calculated for several scenarios across the benign to adverse spectrum for each of the Company’s loan portfolio segments. The weighting of scenarios is subject to periodic review and may be adjusted based on the Company’s view of current economic conditions.Given the inherent limitations of a solely quantitative model, qualitative adjustments are included to arrive at the ending calculated loss amount in order to account for data points not captured from quantitative inputs alone. Qualitative criteria the Company considers includes, among other things, the following:•Regulatory and Legal - matters that may impact the timeliness and/or amounts of repayments;•Concentration - portfolio composition and loan concentration;•Collateral Dependency - changes in collateral values;•Lending/Underwriting Standards - current lending policies and the effects of any new policies;•Nature and Volume - loan production volume and mix;•Macroeconomic Environment - considerations not reflected in the data utilized in the model; and•Loan Trends - credit performance trends, including a borrower’s financial condition and credit rating.Specifically, the Company reviews whether the model reflects the appropriate level of PD and LGD, given the macroeconomic forecasts used as compared to the Company’s loan portfolio. the Company determines the adequacy of the F-13allowance for credit losses based on reviews of individual loans, recent loss experience, current economic conditions, expectations about future economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans, including loan-to-value ratios, and other pertinent factors. If, based on the Company’s evaluation, macroeconomic factors do not capture the Company’s assumption regarding collateral values (LGD) and defaults (PD), the Company will apply additional qualitative overlays to the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In determining an allowance for credit losses for certain assets, such as margin loans and securities borrowed transactions, the Company considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the instrument, an allowance for credit losses is established for the unsecured amount and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the instrument.Accrued Interest. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from amortized cost and is presented separately in “Other Assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company does not estimate an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as the Company has a policy to charge off accrued interest deemed uncollectible in a timely manner. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, which generally occurs when a borrower becomes delinquent by 90 days, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.Individually Assessed Loans. Credit losses are estimated on a collective basis, unless an individual loan’s credit risk characteristics make it unique compared to the overall group, in which case the loan would be individually assessed. Loan Commitments. Loans commitments not unconditionally cancellable are subject to an estimate of credit loss under a current expected credit loss model. The Company’s process for determining the estimate of credit loss on loan commitments is the same as it is on loans. Refer to detail of Allowance on Credit Losses above. Allowance on Credit Losses of off-balance sheet commitments is presented separately in “Accounts payable and other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Leases - Lessee Arrangements. The Company leases office space under operating lease agreements scheduled to expire at various dates. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which is a blended rate comprised of the FHLB term rate and the Company’s subordinated debt rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives. Right-of-use assets are reported in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related lease liabilities are reported in “Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities.” All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in “Occupancy and equipment” expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Servicing Rights. Servicing rights assets are recognized when such rights are retained upon sale of loans, or are
purchased, and are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur and the adjustments are included in “Mortgage banking and servicing rights income,” a component of non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Derivatives. Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as freestanding derivatives. The Company enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to economically hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in “Mortgage banking and servicing rights income” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company makes markets in interest rate swap and cap derivatives to facilitate customer demand. The Company enters into offsetting derivative transactions to offset its interest rate risk associated with this customer transaction activity. The Company acquired as part of the FDIC Loan Purchase certain customer-facing interest rate derivatives and related market-facing derivatives which offset the Company’s interest rate risk. For additional information on these derivatives see Note 2— “Acquisitions” and Note 6— “Derivatives.” Changes in the fair values of these derivatives, and related fees, are included in “Banking and service fees” on the Consolidated Statements of Income.Additionally, the Company applies hedge accounting to certain derivative instruments for interest rate risk management purposes. The Company uses such derivative instruments to hedge forecasted variable cash flows from floating-F-14rate deposits. For designated cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are initially recorded in OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings once the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative gains and losses reclassified to earnings are recognized in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income, consistent with the hedged floating-rate deposits.Hedge accounting relationships, including the associated risk management objective and strategy, are formally documented at inception. Additionally, the effectiveness of hedge accounting relationships is monitored throughout the duration of the hedge period. Hedge accounting treatment is discontinued either when the derivative is terminated, when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be, or has ceased to be, effective as a hedge or if the Company removes the cash flow hedge designation. If a hedge accounting relationship is terminated, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were originally hedged affect earnings. However, if the original hedged transaction is deemed probable not to occur, the corresponding amount in AOCI is immediately recognized in income.The Company also enters into foreign exchange derivatives in order to economically hedge its foreign exchange exposure to certain loans denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives, and related fees, are included in “Banking and service fees” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The aggregate foreign exchange transaction gain/loss for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was not significant.Derivative assets and liabilities are not subject to any counterparty netting and are presented at fair value on a gross basis in “Other assets” and “Accounts payable and other liabilities”, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash flows related to derivative assets and liabilities are presented in “Net change in assets and liabilities which provide (use) cash-Other Assets” and “Net change in assets and liabilities which provide (use) cash-Accounts payable and other liabilities,” respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.In connection with its derivative transactions, the Company may receive or pledge cash collateral with its counterparties or central clearinghouses to satisfy initial, maintenance and/or variation margin requirements. Any required margin posted by the Company, other than variation margin on centrally-cleared derivatives, is included in “Restricted cash” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variation margin on centrally-cleared derivatives is considered settlement of the derivative transaction, and as such, is presented net against the centrally-cleared derivative asset or liability within “Other assets” or “Accounts payable and other liabilities,” respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Furniture, Equipment and Software. Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years and recorded within “Depreciation and amortization”, a component of non-interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets’ useful lives or the lease term. Furniture, equipment and software are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Income Taxes. Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. The Company records a valuation allowance when the Company believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. An income tax position will be recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, based upon its technical merits. Once that status is met, the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are reported as collateralized financings and recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowed transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount in excess of the fair value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded, as necessary.Customer, Broker-Dealer and Clearing Receivables and Payables. Customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables
represent amounts due on cash and margin transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by clients. These receivables primarily consist of floating-rate loans collateralized by customer-owned securities. The receivables are reported at their outstanding principal balance net of allowance for credit losses. When a receivable is considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded based on the current estimate of expected credit losses for the receivable, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources, such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Securities owned by customers, including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected on the F-15Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also included in these accounts are receivables and payables from brokers and dealers and clearing organizations as well as securities failed to deliver and receive.Business Combinations. Mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets and liabilities acquired and assumed are recorded at their fair values as of the date of the transaction. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Significant estimates and judgments are involved in the fair valuation and purchase price allocation process. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized to “Depreciation and amortization” a component of non-interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income, using accelerated or straight-line methods over their respective estimated useful lives.Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level, which is conducted at least annually. The Company performs impairment testing during the third quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired.The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing updated qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the market rate of return, projected growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparable. Earnings per Common Share. Earnings per common share (“EPS”) are presented under two formats: basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including the additional dilutive potential common shares, such as restricted stock units (“RSUs”).Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation cost is recognized for RSU awards issued to employees, based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company has certain share awards that include market conditions that affect vesting. The fair value of these awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. For awards with only a service condition that have a graded vesting schedule, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards that contain a market condition and have a graded vesting schedule compensation cost is recognized using an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period for the awards. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.Stock of Regulatory Agencies. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system and the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). FHLB members are required to own a certain amount of FHLB stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors while Federal Reserve members are required to own a certain amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock based on the member’s equity capital and surplus. FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Additionally, Axos Clearing, LLC is a member of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), a financial services company providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets. Members are required to own a certain amount of DTCC stock based on the clearing levels and other factors. DTCC stock is valued based on information provided by the DTCC, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recovery of carrying value.Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”). The Company invests as a limited partner in LIHTC partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects which generate tax benefits for investors through the realization of tax credits and deductions, which may be subject to recapture by taxing authorities if compliance requirements are not met. The Company amortizes the investment in proportion to the allocated tax benefits using the proportional amortization method of accounting and record such benefits net of investment amortization in income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The investment is included within “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance. The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, F-16which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Cash surrender value of life insurance is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the cash surrender value are recorded within “Banking and service fees” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and gains and losses on derivatives in designated cash flow hedge accounting relationships.Loss Contingencies. The Company records an accrual for a loss contingency when the estimated loss is both probable and reasonably estimated.Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial involvement with the entity and reassesses whether it remains the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis. This determination includes an assessment of the design of the VIE, the power to make significant economic decisions and the variable interests held by the Company relative to other parties. The Company consolidated the results of operations and financial position of three lending-related entities, which it considers VIEs. The Company consolidated these VIEs because it or its subsidiaries is deemed to be the primary beneficiary since the Company or its subsidiaries has the power to direct the loan servicing or portfolio management activities, which are the activities that most significantly affect the VIEs’ economic performance, and the Company or its subsidiaries has the obligation to absorb the majority of the losses or benefits through ownership of all of the debt securities issued by the trusts. For these VIEs, the loans transferred to the VIEs are pledged as collateral to the related debt securities. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, certain loans that can only be used to settle debt securities of these VIEs were $1,432.7 million and $1,191.7 million, respectively. For further information on the loans reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets resulting from the consolidation of the three lending-related entities, see Note 5— “Loans & Allowance for Credit Losses.”The Company also invests in low-income housing tax credit investments, certain mortgage-backed securities and partnership interests which are determined to be VIEs. However, given that the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance, the Company does not consolidate these VIEs. The carrying amount of these non-consolidated VIEs represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss. For additional information on the Company's LIHTC investments, see Note 9—"Other Assets" and for additional information on the Company's mortgage-backed securities, see Note 4—"Available-For-Sale Securities."New Accounting StandardsRecently Adopted Accounting StandardsDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, which expanded business segment disclosure requirements, including requiring additional disclosures about significant business segment expenses. The ASU also added requirements to define the position and title of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of business segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and resource allocation. The Company applied this ASU retrospectively to periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. There was no impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operation upon adoption. See Note 22—“Segment Reporting” for the Company’s business segment disclosures.Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet AdoptedIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which requires further granularity on the disclosure of income taxes, including:•Certain prescribed line items in the income tax rate reconciliation presented both in dollar and percentage terms;•Income taxes paid, income before income taxes and income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes; and•Further disaggregation of income taxes paid by any individual jurisdiction equal to or exceeding five percent of total income taxes paid.This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect any significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.F-17In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which requires disaggregation of operating expenses by relevant expense caption on the statement of income into prescribed categories, including employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company does not expect any significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.2.    ACQUISITIONSOn August 23, 2023, the Company acquired approximately $52 million of marine floor financing loans at par value along with other assets for an additional $2 million, primarily consisting of servicing rights as well as certain employees. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.On December 7, 2023, the Company acquired from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) two loan portfolios, comprising both PCD and non-PCD loans, with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $1.3 billion at a fair value of $901.5 million, reflecting a non-credit-related discount of $306.8 million and an allowance for credit losses on PCD loans of $70.1 million, (the “FDIC Loan Purchase”). Also included in the acquisition were certain related interest rate derivative assets and liabilities with a fair value of $109.0 million and $104.4 million, respectively, as of the date of the acquisition and whose maturities generally align with those of the loans acquired. The acquisition of the non-PCD loans and interest rate derivatives was accounted for as a purchase of financial assets and liabilities, and the Company recognized a $92.4 million gain on the transaction included in “Gain on acquisition” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional information on PCD loans, see Note 1—“Organizations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and for additional information on the Company’s loans and derivative instruments, see Note 5—“Loans & Allowance For Credit Losses” and Note 6—“Derivatives,” respectively.The following table summarizes the PCD loans acquired in the FDIC Loan Purchase:(Dollars in thousands)TotalUnpaid principal balance$341,301 Non-credit discount(100,686)Allowance for credit losses at acquisition(70,097)Purchase price$170,518 3.    FAIR VALUEFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models such as discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.Classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair-value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified:Securities—trading and available-for-sale. Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Available-for-sale securities consist of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) issued by U.S. government-backed, including Ginnie Mae, or government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (“agency”), MBS issued by non-agencies and municipal securities. Fair value for agency securities and municipal securities are generally based on quoted F-18market prices of similar securities used to form a dealer quote or a pricing matrix. These securities are classified in Level 2. There continues to be significant illiquidity in the market for certain MBS issued by non-agencies, including those held by the Company, which impacts the availability and reliability of transparent pricing. As orderly quoted market prices are not available, the Level 3 fair values for these securities are determined by the Company utilizing industry-standard tools to calculate the net present value of the expected cash flows available to the securities from the underlying mortgage assets.To determine the performance of the underlying mortgage loan pools, the Company estimates prepayments, defaults, and loss severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors, including housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower attributes such as credit score and loan documentation at the time of origination. The Company inputs for each security a projection of monthly default rates, loss severity rates and voluntary prepayment rates for the underlying mortgages for the remaining life of the security to determine the expected cash flows. The projections of default rates are derived by the Company from the historic default rate observed in the pool of loans collateralizing the security, increased by and decreased by the forecasted increase or decrease in the national unemployment rate. The projections of loss severity rates are derived by the Company from the historic loss severity rate observed in the pool of loans, increased by or decreased by the forecasted increase or decrease in the national home price index (“HPI”). The largest factors influencing the Company’s modeling of the monthly default rate are unemployment and the HPI, as a strong correlation exists. The most updated unemployment rate reported in June 2025 was 4.1%.To determine the discount rates used to compute the present value of the expected cash flows for these non-agency MBS securities, the Company separates the securities by the borrower characteristics in the underlying pool. Specifically, “prime” securities generally have borrowers with higher FICO scores and better documentation of income. “Alt-A” securities generally have borrowers with a lower FICO and less documentation of income. “Pay-option ARMs” are Alt-A securities with borrowers that tend to pay the least amount of principal (or increase their loan balance through negative amortization). The Company calculates separate discount rates for prime, Alt-A and Pay-option ARM non-agency MBS securities using market-participant assumptions for risk, capital and return on equity. The default rates and the severities are projected for every non-agency MBS security held by the Company and will vary monthly based upon the actual performance of the security and the macroeconomic factors discussed above. Based upon the actual performance of the underlying collateral, the securities’ credit enhancement will be impacted. The Company applies its discount rates to the projected monthly cash flows, which already reflect the full impact of all forecasted losses using the assumptions described above.The Company’s estimate of fair value for non-agency securities using Level 3 pricing is highly subjective and is based on the Company’s estimate of voluntary prepayments, default rates, severities and discount margins, which are forecasted monthly over the remaining life of each security. Changes in one or more of these assumptions can cause a significant change in the estimated fair value. For further details see the table later in this note that summarizes quantitative information about level 3 fair value measurements.Loans Held for Sale. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined by pricing for comparable assets or by existing forward sales commitment prices with investors. Loans held for sale are classified as Level 2.Servicing Rights. Fair value is derived from market-driven valuation changes as well as modeled amortization involving the run-off of value that occurs due to the passage of time as individual loans are paid by borrowers. Market expectations about loan duration, and correspondingly the expected term of future servicing cash flows, may vary from time to time due to changes in expected prepayment activity, especially when interest rates rise or fall. Fair value is also dependent on the discount rate used in calculating present value, which is derived from observable market activity, market participants, and results in Level 3 classification. Management reviews and adjusts the discount rate and prepayment assumptions on an ongoing basis. Derivatives. The fair value of interest rate locks is estimated based on changes in to be announced (“TBA”) values which are based upon mortgage interest rates from the date the interest on the loan is locked, adjusted for items such as estimated fallout and costs to originate the loan. These are classified under level 2. The fair value of forward sale commitments is based upon prices in active secondary markets for identical securities or based on quoted market prices of similar assets used to form a dealer quote or a pricing matrix. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a commitment is determined by quoted prices for a similar commitment or commitments, adjusted for the specific attributes of each commitment. These are classified under level 2.The fair value of interest rate swaps and caps entered into to facilitate customer transaction activity is based upon observable market forward rate curves. These are classified under Level 2.F-19The fair value of foreign exchange swaps and spot contracts is based primarily upon current spot exchange rates and forward exchange rates (derived from spot rates and interest rate differentials between the currency pairs). These are classified as Level 2.

Generally, a change in the assumptions used for the default rate is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for the voluntary prepayment rate. For servicing rights, significant increases in the voluntary prepayment rate or discount rate in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement, while a significant increase in expected life in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the voluntary prepayment rate is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in expected life.The aggregate fair value of loans held for sale, carried at fair value, contractual balance (including accrued interest) and unrealized gain were:At June 30,(Dollars in thousands)20252024Aggregate fair value$10,012 $16,482 Contractual balance9,870 15,966 Unrealized gain $142 $516 The total interest income and amount of gains and losses from changes in fair value included in earnings for loans held for sale were:For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands)202520242023Interest income$999 $769 $415 Change in fair value(366)122 57 Total$633 $891 $472 F-22FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows:June 30, 2025Fair Value(Dollars in thousands)CarryingAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total Fair ValueFinancial assets:Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$2,176,354 $2,176,354 $— $— $2,176,354 Trading securities649 — 649 — 649 Available-for-sale securities66,008 — 50,439 15,569 66,008 Stock of regulatory agencies35,163 — 35,163 — 35,163 Loans held for sale, at fair value10,012 — 10,012 — 10,012 Loans held for investment—net21,049,610 — — 21,288,921 21,288,921 Securities borrowed139,396 — — 138,103 138,103 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables252,720 — — 251,126 251,126 Servicing rights27,218 — — 27,218 27,218 Other assets - derivative instruments117,734 — 17,734 — 17,734 Financial liabilities:Total deposits20,829,543 — 20,642,953 — 20,642,953 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank60,000 — 56,934 — 56,934 Borrowings, subordinated notes and debentures312,671 — 285,282 — 285,282 Securities loaned139,426 — — 138,698 138,698 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing payables350,606 — — 350,606 350,606 Accounts payable and other liabilities - derivative instruments68,498 — 68,498 — 68,498 June 30, 2024Fair Value(Dollars in thousands)CarryingAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total Fair ValueFinancial assets:Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$2,185,776 $2,185,776 $— $— $2,185,776 Trading securities353 — 353 — 353 Available-for-sale securities141,611 — 30,683 110,928 141,611 Stock of regulatory agencies21,957 — 21,957 — 21,957 Loans held for sale, at fair value16,482 — 16,482 — 16,482 Loans held for sale, at lower of cost or fair value— — — — — Loans held for investment—net19,231,385 — — 19,209,442 19,209,442 Securities borrowed67,212 — — 71,480 71,480 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing receivables240,028 — — 249,317 249,317 Servicing rights28,924 — — 28,924 28,924 Other assets - derivative instruments1106,796 — 106,796 — 106,796 Financial liabilities:Total deposits19,359,217 — 19,217,281 — 19,217,281 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank90,000 — 84,201 — 84,201 Borrowings, subordinated notes and debentures325,679 — 302,487 — 302,487 Securities loaned74,177 — — 74,021 74,021 Customer, broker-dealer and clearing payables301,127 — — 301,127 301,127 Accounts payable and other liabilities - derivative instruments102,949 — 102,949 — 102,949 1 Derivatives assets as of June 30, 2025 are presented net of $55.4 million of variation margin on centrally-cleared derivatives.

For fixed rate loans, deposits, borrowings or subordinated debt and for variable rate loans, deposits, borrowings or subordinated debt with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. A discussion of the methods of valuing trading securities, available-for-sale securities and loans held for sale can be found earlier in this footnote. The fair value of off-balance sheet items is not considered material.4.    AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIESThe amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities were:June 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)AmortizedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueMortgage-backed securities (MBS):Agency1$48,229 $327 $(1,799)$46,757 Non-agency214,395 1,232 (58)15,569 Total mortgage-backed securities62,624 1,559 (1,857)62,326 Municipal3,682 — — 3,682 Total available-for-sale securities$66,306 $1,559 $(1,857)$66,008 June 30, 2024(Dollars in thousands)AmortizedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueMortgage-backed securities (MBS):Agency1$29,835 $83 $(2,659)$27,259 Non-agency2110,658 838 (568)110,928 Total mortgage-backed securities140,493 921 (3,227)138,187 Municipal3,788 — (364)3,424 Total available-for-sale securities$144,281 $921 $(3,591)$141,611 1 Includes securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency, and the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.2 Private sponsors of securities collateralized primarily by first-lien mortgage loans on commercial properties or by pools of 1-4 family residential first mortgages. Primarily super senior securities secured by prime, Alt-A or pay-option ARM mortgages.The Company evaluates available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position based on an analysis of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the credit characteristics of the securities, such as the forecasted cash flows, credit ratings, credit enhancement, and government agency or government sponsored enterprise backing, as applicable, and (2) whether the Company intends to sell or will be required to sell any of the securities before recovering the amortized cost basis. Based on its analysis, the Company determined the unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are primarily driven by the increase in interest rates since the securities were purchased and, accordingly, no credit losses were recognized on AFS securities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 and there was no amount in the allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024. The face amounts of available-for-sale securities pledged to secure borrowings at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 were $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no sales of securities.F-24Securities with unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, were:June 30, 2025Available-for-sale securities in loss position forLess Than12 MonthsMore Than12 MonthsTotal(Dollars in thousands)FairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesMBS:Agency$108 $— $16,212 $(1,799)$16,320 $(1,799)Non-agency2,138 (43)10,695 (15)12,833 (58)Total MBS2,246 (43)26,907 (1,814)29,153 (1,857)Municipal— — — — — — Total available-for-sale securities$2,246 $(43)$26,907 $(1,814)$29,153 $(1,857)June 30, 2024Available-for-sale securities in loss position forLess Than12 MonthsMore Than12 MonthsTotal(Dollars in thousands)FairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesMBS:Agency$2,644 $(31)$19,298 $(2,628)$21,942 $(2,659)Non-agency15 — 78,364 (568)78,379 (568)Total MBS2,659 (31)97,662 (3,196)100,321 (3,227)Municipal— — 3,424 (364)3,424 (364)Total available-for-sale securities$2,659 $(31)$101,086 $(3,560)$103,745 $(3,591)The following table sets forth the expected maturity distribution of our mortgage-backed securities, which is based on assumed prepayment rates, and the maturity distribution of our non-MBS, which is based on the contractual maturity:As of June 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)Total AmountDue Within One YearDue after One but within Five YearsDue after Five but within Ten YearsDue After Ten YearsMBS:Agency$48,229 $11,537 $29,753 $5,158 $1,781 Non-Agency14,395 10,975 1,442 1,203 775 Total MBS$62,624 $22,512 $31,195 $6,361 $2,556 Municipal3,682 — — — 3,682 Available-for-sale—Amortized cost$66,306 $22,512 $31,195 $6,361 $6,238 Available-for-sale—Fair value$66,008 $22,375 $30,806 $6,416 $6,411 F-255.

The provision for credit losses was primarily driven by the commercial & industrial - non-RE and commercial real estate portfolios, reflecting loan growth, as well as the quantitative impact of macroeconomic variables in the allowance for credit losses model, including the 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates and unemployment rates.Loan products within each portfolio contain varying collateral types which impact the estimate of the loss given default utilized in the calculation of the allowance.

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends. In addition to the borrower’s primary source of repayment, in its risk rating process the Company considers all available sources of repayment, including obligor guaranties and liquidations of pledged collateral, where individually or together such sources would fully repay the loan on a timely basis. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans based on credit risk. The Company uses the following internally-defined risk ratings:Pass. Loans where repayment in full is expected through any of the borrower’s sources of repayment.Special Mention. Loans where any credit risk is not considered significant yet require management’s attention given certain currently identified characteristics of the borrower, collateral securing the loan and the obligor’s net worth and paying capacity. If the identified credit risks are not adequately monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken and the Company’s credit position with respect to the loan may deteriorate in the future.Substandard. Loans where currently identified characteristics of the borrower, collateral securing the loan and the obligor’s net worth and paying capacity, taken together, could jeopardize the repayment of the debt. A loan not fully supported by at least one available source of repayment and involves a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss in that loan if the weakness is not cured. A loan supported by a guaranty, collateral sufficient to incentivize a sale or refinance, or cash flow that is sufficient for timely repayment in full will not be classified as substandard even if the loan has a well-defined weakness in other sources of repayment.Doubtful. Loans reflecting the same characteristics as those classified as substandard, but for which repayment in full in accordance with the contractual terms is currently considered highly unlikely.The Company reviews and grades loans following a continuous review process, featuring coverage of all loan types and business lines at least quarterly. Continuous reviewing provides more effective risk monitoring because it immediately tests for potential impacts caused by changes in personnel, policy, products or underwriting standards.F-28The following tables present the composition of loans by portfolio segment, fiscal year of origination and credit quality indicator, and the amount of gross charge-offs:June 30, 2025Loans Held for Investment by Fiscal Year of OriginationRevolving Loans Total(Dollars in thousands)20252024202320222021PriorSingle Family-Mortgage & WarehousePass$750,357 $269,165 $451,330 $1,067,144 $434,352 $715,620 $599,406 $4,287,374 Special Mention2,129 1,080 5,362 3,140 5,254 26,604 9,967 53,536 Substandard— — — 7,255 6,720 40,393 — 54,368 Doubtful— — — — — — — — Total752,486 270,245 456,692 1,077,539 446,326 782,617 609,373 4,395,278 Gross charge-offs— 340 — 400 — 2,296 — 3,036 Multifamily and Commercial MortgagePass75,755 22,435 632,120 859,189 422,683 842,787 1,450 2,856,419 Special Mention— — 3,400 — 7,255 18,272 — 28,927 Substandard— — 8,530 13,199 — 33,664 — 55,393 Doubtful— — — — — — — — Total75,755 22,435 644,050 872,388 429,938 894,723 1,450 2,940,739 Gross charge-offs— 375 86 5 — 8,099 — 8,565 Commercial Real EstatePass3,135,530 1,342,372 679,875 575,642 152,581 47,214 960,145 6,893,359 Special Mention— — — — — — — Substandard— — — 9,500 5,000 14,723 14,605 43,828 Doubtful— — — — — — — — Total3,135,530 1,342,372 679,875 585,142 157,581 61,937 974,750 6,937,187 Gross charge-offs— — — 165 — — — 165 Commercial & Industrial -

The Company may grant certain modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective following the adoption of ASU 2022-02, are reported as financial difficulty modifications (“FDMs”). The Company’s modification programs provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays and/or principal forgiveness. FDMs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were not significant.6.    DERIVATIVESThe following table presents the fair values and notional amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments. While the notional amounts give an indication of the volume of the Company’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Company’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged, rather it is a reference amount used to calculate payments.

The Company manages credit exposure from certain of these transactions by entering into master netting agreements. The relevant agreements allow for the efficient closeout of transactions, liquidation and set-off of collateral against the net amount owed by the counterparty following a default. Default events generally include failure to pay, insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty.The following tables present information about the offsetting of these instruments and related collateral amounts:June 30, 2025(Dollars in thousands)Gross Assets / LiabilitiesAmounts OffsetNet Balance Sheet AmountAmounts Not Offset2Net Assets / LiabilitiesAssets:Securities borrowed$139,396 $— $139,396 $139,396 $— Other assets — derivative instruments117,734 — 17,734 11,174 6,560 Liabilities:Securities loaned$139,426 $— $139,426 $139,426 $— Accounts payable and other liabilities — derivative instruments68,497 — 68,497 6,122 62,375 June 30, 2024(Dollars in thousands)Gross Assets / LiabilitiesAmounts OffsetNet Balance Sheet AmountAmounts Not Offset2Net Assets / LiabilitiesAssets:Securities borrowed$67,212 $— $67,212 $67,212 $— Other assets — derivative instruments1106,796 — 106,796 18,524 88,272 Liabilities:Securities loaned$74,177 $— $74,177 $74,177 $— Accounts payable and other liabilities — derivative instruments102,949 — 102,949 414 102,535 1 Other Assets - Derivative Assets as of June 30, 2025 are presented net of $55.4 million of variation margin on centrally-cleared derivatives.

The Plan is designed to encourage selected employees and directors to improve operations and increase profits, and to accept or continue employment or association with the Company through participation in the growth in the value of the Company’s common stock. RSUs have a grant price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the award date. RSUs granted generally vest over a three-year period based on service, with 33% of the underlying shares vesting on each annual anniversary of the award.2014 Plan. In November 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 2014 Plan, as amended and restated. The number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2014 Plan is 6,680,000, less RSU awards granted, plus any RSUs that become available upon the forfeiture, expiration, cancellation or settlement in cash awards outstanding under the 2014 Plan. At June 30, 2025, 1,191,861 shares of common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to grant awards under the 2014 Plan.Effective July 1, 2017, the Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer (the “Agreement”) that authorizes an award of RSUs (the “RSU award”). The RSU award is an equity-based award and carries F-44a service condition and a market condition that incorporates a measurement of the Company’s total stock return to stockholders in comparison to the total stock return of the ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index. The accounting grant date of the RSU award is July 1, 2017 and expensing of the RSU award began on this date at the fair value measurement amount as determined by the Company’s valuation process. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of path-dependent options and determined the fair value using an expected return based on the 5-year US Treasury constant maturity rate, an equity volatility based on 6-month and 1-year historical daily trading history, market capitalization, and stock price for the RSU award. On July 1, 2017, the estimated fair value of the RSU award was $20.5 million, which vests in five tranches over a total period of nine years.Effective each January 1st following the initial five-year term, the Agreement automatically renewed for one additional fiscal year term with the accounting grant date the same as the renewal date of the respective award. For each automatic one-year renewal, the Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation with key inputs of an expected return on the average of the 1 and 2 year U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate, an equity volatility based on 1.5 year historical daily trading history, market capitalization, and stock price. The estimated fair values for the one-year renewals occurring during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 Award were $8.8 million, $9.4 million and $5.2 million respectively, on each award’s grant date. The actual awards are determined by the actual performance of the Company’s total stock return in comparison to the total stock return of the ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index in the respective periods.As of June 30, 2025, compensation expense not yet recognized over the remaining term of the Agreement and subsequent renewals was $16.3 million.At June 30, 2025, compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested awards was $63.6 million and the weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is 1.3 years.The following table presents the status and changes in RSUs for the periods indicated:RSUsWeighted-AverageGrant-Date Fair ValueNon-vested balance at June 30, 20241,541,194 $43.95 Granted1,014,356 63.94 Vested(880,010)46.38 Forfeitures(111,524)49.66 Non-vested balance at June 30, 20251,564,016 $55.50 The Company recognized $35.5 million, $30.7 million and $26.1 million of stock compensation in net income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. The related income tax benefit was $10.4 million, $9.0 million and $7.5 million in the respective years. The total fair value of shares vested during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $60.6 million.F-4517.    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”):June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)202520242023Earnings Per Common ShareNet income$432,908 $450,008 $307,165 Average common shares issued and outstanding56,862,630 57,509,029 59,691,541 Earnings per common share$7.61 $7.82 $5.15 Diluted Earnings Per Common ShareNet income$432,908 $450,008 $307,165 Average common shares issued and outstanding56,862,630 57,509,029 59,691,541 Dilutive effect of average unvested RSUs1,378,791 1,216,607 875,313 Average dilutive common shares outstanding58,241,421 58,725,636 60,566,854 Diluted earnings per common share$7.43 $7.66 $5.07 Weighted average antidilutive common stock equivalents (excluded from the computation of EPS)6,192 9,744 4,505 18.    COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ACTIVITIESCredit-Related Financial Instruments. The Company is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments are commitments to extend credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The following table presents a summary of off-balance sheet commitments.Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. For single family loans classified as held for sale, the Company matches unfunded commitments to originate loans with commitments to sell loans. The Company also has standby letters of credit commitments.(dollars in thousands)June 30, 2025Commitments to fund loans$5,575,685 Commitments to sell loans$6,166 Commitments to contribute capital - Non-LIHTC$3,514 Standby letters of credit$9,225 In addition, the Company has $47.4 million of commitments to contribute capital to LIHTC investments included in “Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 9—“Other Assets” for additional information on LIHTC investments.In the normal course of business, Axos Clearing’s customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer securities transactions. These activities may expose Axos Clearing to off-balance-sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations and Axos Clearing has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss. Axos Clearing’s clearing agreements with broker-dealers for which it provides clearing services requires them to indemnify Axos Clearing if customers fail to satisfy their contractual obligation. As of June 30, 2025, non-customer and customer margin securities were available to the Company to utilize as collateral on various borrowings or for other purposes. The Company pledged $139.4 million of these available securities as collateral for securities loaned, pledged $146.7 million for bank loans, and pledged $52.0 million to meet OCC margin requirements of $29.5 million.F-46Litigation. A consolidated derivative action, In re BofI Holding, Inc., Case No. 15cv2722GPC (KSC), is pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the “Derivative Action”). The complaint in the Derivative Action sets forth allegations made in a related employment action, Erhart v. BofI Holding Inc., No. 15cv2287 BAS (NLS) (S.D. Cal.) (the “Employment Action”) brought by a former employee of the Company and was stayed pending resolution of the Employment Action. On October 4, 2023, the court hearing the Employment Action entered a final amended judgment awarding damages and attorneys’ fees to the plaintiff. The defendant filed a Notice of Appeal from the Employment Action judgment and all orders merged therein, and the parties have filed opening and responsive briefs and an oral argument was held on January 15, 2025. On January 2, 2024, the Derivative Action plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint. On March 5, 2024, the court stayed the case until resolution of the appeal in the Employment Action. On February 6, 2025, the appellate court affirmed the jury’s verdict in the Employment Action in a short, unpublished decision. On July 24, 2025, the Employment Action defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking the United States Supreme Court to review the appellate court’s decision. The Derivative Action defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint on April 4, 2025. A hearing on said motion was held on June 26, 2025, and the court has yet to issue its decision.
Such defendants dispute, and intend to vigorously defend against, the allegations raised in the Third Amended Complaint. The Derivative Action plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of the Company with respect to the Employment Action and also seeks damages on behalf of the Company in connection with a now settled securities class action that was also based upon allegations made in the Employment Action and settled within available insurance coverage without attribution of wrongdoing to the Company, its management, or its directors.The following three putative class action lawsuits are pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, under the following case names and numbers: (1) In re Axos Bank d/b/a UFB Direct Litigation, 3:23-cv-02266-BJC-DTF; (2) Pliszka et al. v. Axos Bank d/b/a UFB Direct, Case No. 3:24-cv-00445-BJC-DTF; and (3) Ash et al. v. Axos Bank d/b/a UFB Direct, Case No. 3:24-cv-01157-BJC-DTF (collectively, the “UFB Actions”). The plaintiffs in the UFB Actions allege that certain rate representations made by Axos Bank with respect to its UFB products were false or misleading. Axos Bank filed a motion to compel arbitration or dismiss the complaint in each of the UFB Actions. On September 13, 2024, the court entered an order compelling arbitration in each lawsuit. Accordingly, a separate AAA arbitration was initiated with respect to each of the UFB Actions. On March 26, 2025, the arbitrator in the Pliszka arbitration proceedings issued an order finding that none of the claims raised are subject to arbitration, dismissing the arbitration and remanding the case back to the United States District Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the arbitrator in the Ash arbitration via an order issued on June 3, 2025.
The arbitrator in the Stempel arbitration reached a contrary conclusion and entered an order finding the claims to be arbitrable on June 5, 2025. All defendants dispute, and intend to vigorously defend against, the allegations raised in the UFB Actions. The Company does not expect the ultimate outcome of the UFB Actions to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. It is not presently possible to state whether the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable or remote, or to estimate the amount or range of any possible loss to the Company should an unfavorable outcome occur.19.    REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTSThe Company and the Bank. The Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by the Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for the Company and the OCC has similar requirements for the Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.Quantitative measures established by regulation require the Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require the Company and Bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. To be “well capitalized,” the Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Additionally, the Bank is required to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to at least 1.5% of total average adjusted assets. At June 30, 2025, the Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. At June 30, 2025, the Company and Bank were “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since June 30, 2025 that would materially adversely change the Company’s and Bank’s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support the Company’s and Bank’s further growth and to maintain their “well capitalized” status.F-47The Company and Bank both elected the five-year CECL transition guidance for calculating regulatory capital and ratios and the June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 amounts reflect this election. This guidance allowed an entity to add back to regulatory capital 100% of the impact of the day one CECL transition adjustment and 25% of subsequent increases to the allowance for credit losses through June 30, 2024. Beginning with fiscal year 2023, this cumulative amount is phased out of regulatory capital at 25% per year until it is 100% phased out of regulatory capital beginning in fiscal year 2026.The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts, capital ratios and capital requirements under Basel III were as follows:Axos Financial, Inc.Axos Bank“Well Capitalized”RatioMinimum CapitalRatio(Dollars in thousands)June 30, 2025June 30, 2024June 30, 2025June 30, 2024Regulatory Capital:Tier 1 $2,554,071$2,167,781$2,360,284$2,181,426Common equity tier 1 $2,554,071$2,167,781$2,360,284$2,181,426Total capital$3,117,763$2,678,489$2,603,589$2,365,061Assets:Average adjusted$23,813,242$22,979,871$23,077,089$22,391,541Total risk-weighted $20,404,204$18,049,571$19,003,094$17,128,880Regulatory Capital Ratios:Tier 1 leverage (to adjusted average assets)10.73 %9.43 %10.23 %9.74 %5.00%4.00%Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)12.52 %12.01 %12.42 %12.74 %6.50%4.50%Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)12.52 %12.01 %12.42 %12.74 %8.00%6.00%Total capital (to risk-weighted assets)15.28 %14.84 %13.70 %13.81 %10.00%8.00%Under Basel III all banking organizations are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. At June 30, 2025, the Company and Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirement. Inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, the common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratio minimums are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. A banking organization with a buffer of less than the required amount is subject to increasingly stringent limitations on such distributions and payments as the buffer approaches zero. In addition, these requirements also generally prohibit a banking organization from making such distributions or payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative and its capital conservation buffer ratio was 2.5% or less at the end of the previous quarter. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income.Axos Clearing. Pursuant to the net capital requirements of the Exchange Act, Axos Clearing is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital (Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act). Under this rule, the Company has elected to operate under the alternate method and is required to maintain minimum net capital of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions, as defined. Under the alternate method, Axos Clearing may not repay subordinated debt, pay cash distributions, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.The net capital positions of Axos Clearing were as follows: (Dollars in thousands)June 30, 2025June 30, 2024Net capital$86,996 $101,462 Excess Capital$81,834 $96,654 Net capital as a percentage of aggregate debit items33.71 %42.21 %Net capital in excess of 5% aggregate debit items$74,091 $89,442 F-48Axos Clearing, as a clearing broker, is subject to the SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act) which requires segregation of funds in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers (“Customer Reserve Bank Account”) and proprietary accounts of brokers (“PAB Reserve Account”). As of June 30, 2025, Axos Clearing was in compliance with its Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Account deposit requirements.20.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANThe Company has one 401(k) plan whereby substantially all of its employees may participate in the plan. Employees may contribute up to 100% of their compensation subject to certain limits based on federal tax laws. The Company provides an employer matching contribution to the 401(k) plan based on an employee’s designated deferral of their eligible compensation. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, expenses attributable to the plan amounted to $6.5 million, $4.5 million, and $3.5 million, respectively. These expenses are included in “Salaries and related costs” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The contribution made during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, was 57,947 shares with a fair market value of $4.0 million and is reflected in “Stock-based compensation activity” in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.F-4921.    PARENT-ONLY CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe following tables present Axos Financial, Inc.

The operating segments and segment results of the Company are determined based upon the management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments and by which segment results are evaluated by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on pre-tax profit or loss from operations in conjunction with its corporate strategy. Salaries and related costs represent the significant segment expense that is regularly provided to the CODM. The Company operates through two operating segments: Banking Business Segment and Securities Business Segment. Inter-segment transactions are eliminated in consolidation and primarily include non-interest income earned by the Securities Business Segment and non-interest expense incurred by the Banking Business Segment for cash sorting fees related to deposits sourced from Securities Business Segment customers, as well as interest expense paid by the Banking Business Segment to each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and to the Company itself for their operating cash held on deposit with the Banking Business Segment.
