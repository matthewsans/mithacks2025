Trutankless’ proprietary app is expected to launch into the iOS and Android store and will augment other products in the home automation space. Overview of Potential Markets and Summary of Marketing Plan Management intends to focus on the United States residential market initially. For decades Americans have used only tank type water heaters, however the market is increasingly towards alternatives like tankless water heaters. Many brands are powered by natural gas, while several others use electricity. Almost half of American homes do not have natural gas available and there has been a trend in many markets towards renewable and cleaner energy alternatives to provide the energy to operate water heaters for the residential and commercial markets in North America. The company’s focus markets favor electric water heaters, of which electric tankless have additional benefits over gas powered models because they can be installed almost anywhere in a home (closets, attics, utility rooms, etc.) where hot water is needed. The lack of exhaust, noise, and a need for combustible fuel improves flexibility of floor plan design for builders, architects, and remodelers. In addition, gas tankless water heaters may not be suitable for many applications due to challenges with adequate fuel supply, the need for exhaust vents with specific safety and regulatory requirements. Despite these issues, gas tankless water heaters have historically enjoyed significant growth in North America because of the efficiency and performance they provide. The company will continue to focus its efforts on developing products that satisfy growing demand in the electric tankless market. Additionally, the company hopes to launch additional products well suited to its key customers in the repair and replacement wholesale market, as well as home builders and companies associated with new construction in the multifamily and commercial markets.  Home Automation Overview Key trends in the home automation space, which is estimated to reach $46.22 Billion worldwide by 2025, have been driven by consumers’ desire for efficiency and lifestyle improvements. Companies like Nest have helped to introduce the Internet of Things to appliances with a direct impact on how users interact with traditional household appliances and have the ability to reduce energy usage. The trend towards integration with voice assistants is also on the rise with key industry leaders like Alexa and Google Assistant playing larger roles in the home automation industry. Insurance and utility companies have joined this trend by partnering with home automation manufacturers by leveraging different devices to build insurance products including discounts and rebates. While home security and safety monitoring are expected to continue to dominate the overall market, management anticipates energy management and HVAC controls and monitors will be one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S. which accounts for 36% of global demand. Trutankless was designed to replace inefficient tank water heating technology, which is second to HVAC in energy consumption for most homes. Combined with Wi-Fi capabilities, the system could not only save energy it has the ability to inform users and property owners of energy use, water use, and potential issues like leaks or other failures in the plumbing system. Management plans to roll out additional technologies in the future that can integrate with the Company’s trutankless smart apps. Currently, the product has the ability to notify homeowners in the event of water flow while the system is set in away mode. Leak detection, leak damage mitigation, and hot water recirculation for instant hot water at the point of use are becoming major trends in the home automation space. Management believes new products can be introduced into its growing wholesale network to augment trutankless’ momentum and harness growing trends to a fresh audience of plumbing and other home service professionals.  4Table of Contents Homebuilders and plumbing companies have begun selling homes with more technology integrations. The company expects to gain market share based on its ability to offer tech forward products in the wholesale market which supplies plumbing, HVAC, and electrical service companies in the future. Tankless Industry Overview The U.S. gas tankless water heater market is dominated by several brands; U.S. electric tankless water heater market is dominated by a few smaller companies, and tank manufacturers maintain the largest market share. Several Japanese and European manufacturers have begun marketing products in the United States, and since 2003, gas tankless products have experienced dramatic growth. Electric tankless systems have not experienced comparable growth due to several factors, primarily product performance, capacity, product quality and electrical power supply and installation issues.  Manufacturers of tank heaters have a competitive advantage due largely to their product categories long established use, name recognition, established distribution, and brand position in the marketplace. Many plumbers and other building industry professionals were opposed to changing brands or to tankless systems because many tankless water heaters have been poorly designed in the past. As a result, there is a perception among some contractors that these water heaters are more complicated and generally less dependable than traditional tank heaters. This perception is often passed along to consumers when making buying decisions or inquiring about switching to a tankless water heater. While we believe that our products will have superior performance, such as endless hot water, superior longevity, greater efficiency and lower “life cycle” costs than traditional tank water heaters, the Company’s success will depend to a large degree on the successful conversion of traditional water heater buyers to tankless water heater buyers. The acquisition price of tankless water heaters (both gas and electric) is greater than traditional tank water heaters, but the overall cost of ownership will be less than that of traditional tank technologies under typical circumstances. Although the public’s awareness of tankless systems has grown in recent years, and continued growth in the sector is suggestive of increasing awareness of tankless as a viable solution for American homeowners. Our marketing and promotion plans have been developed to increase the awareness of the Company’s brand as the preferred option to traditional tank systems. Trutankless intends to position itself and its brand to capitalize on the shift to more sustainable construction materials and more efficient systems and appliances. Trutankless® Products We manufacture and distribute trutankless® water heaters, a line of new, high-quality, highly efficient electric tankless water heaters are in development. Our trutankless® water heaters have been engineered to outperform and outlast both its tank and tankless predecessors in energy efficiency, output, and durability. It provides endless hot water on demand for a whole household, and it also integrates with home automation systems. We have several features and design innovations which are new to the electric tankless water heater market that we believe will give our products a sustainable competitive advantage over our rivals in the market. Our trutankless® water heaters will to be available solely through wholesale plumbing distributors, including Ferguson, Hajoca, WinSupply, Morrison Supply locations, and several regional distributors. A partial listing of wholesalers may be found on our website (www.trutankless.com). Our trutankless® water heaters were designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products are capable of higher temperature rise than competitive units at given flow rates because of their improved design and greater efficiency. Our trutankless® water heaters can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. Generally, a typical tank water heater lasts about 9 years, whereas gas tankless systems may last longer, but requires more routine maintenance. Our product line is designed to last longer than tank water heaters without any routine maintenance required under most conditions.  5Table of Contents We created a custom heat exchanger for our trutankless® product line that utilizes our patented technology to heat water as it flows through the system, which means customers need not worry about running out of hot water. We believe we’ve selected the best materials available and a collection of exclusive design elements and features to maximize capacity, minimize energy use, and provide a truly maintenance free experience. Our trutankless® water heaters were officially launched in the first quarter of 2014 and is sold throughout the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. We began generating revenue in the first quarter of 2014. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we generated $238,912 in revenue.

From the dashboard, residential and commercial users can obtain real-time status reports, adjust unit temperature settings, view up to three years of water usage data, and change notification settings from anywhere in the world, using a computer or web-enabled smart device at home.trutankless.com. Our primary markets, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and the rest of the Sunbelt region are centers of growth in the U.S. construction industry with green building at an all-time high, and an unprecedented appliance replacement cycle. We intend to take advantage of these powerful macro-economic trends. Industry Recognition and Awards Trutankless® received the Best of IBS 2014 Award for Best Home Technology Product from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) at that year’s International Builders Show (IBS) in Las Vegas. The IBS is produced by NAHB and is the largest annual light construction show in the world – featuring more than 1,100 exhibitors and attracting 75,000 attendees including high level decision makers from some of the largest homebuilders in the world as well as plumbing and HVAC professionals from top companies in major markets. Trutankless® received the Governor’s Award of Merit for Energy and Technology Innovation for the trutankless line of electric tankless heaters at Arizona Forward’s 2014 Environmental Excellence Awards. Trutankless® received Kitchen and Bath Business Magazine’s 2014 K*BB Product Innovator’s Award Judges Choice Product. In 2015, Trutankless was named in Buildings Magazine’s 2015 listing of “Money Savings Products” in the Energy Saving Measures category and received a Special Mention in the Architizer A+ Awards. That same year, Appliance Design Magazine named Trutankless among the winners of their annual Excellence in Design Award, and the editors of Green Builder Magazine named Trutankless as one of their picks as “Hot Product”. Consumer Reports Magazine featured Trutankless in its Top 5 Remodeling Trends for 2016, and leading home improvement website, houzz.com, honored the company with 4 consecutive “Best of Houzz” honors from 2014 through 2018.  6Table of Contents Customers and Markets We sell our products to plumbing wholesale distributors and dealers. Approximately, 95% of our sales have been to wholesale plumbing equipment distributors for commercial and residential repair and replace applications. We rely on commissioned manufacturers’ representatives to market our product lines. Additionally, our products are sold to independent dealers throughout the United States. Manufacturing and Logistics We have engineering agreements with outside development and production engineers, which is ongoing and currently being executed. In December 2020, we executed a second Manufacturing Services Agreement establishing our pricing and payment terms, warranty, shipping, and delivery terms with a North American manufacturer. Finished products are generally shipped Free on Board (FOB) and are typically shipped using common carriers or freight companies which are selected at the time of shipment based on order volume and the best available rates. Intellectual Property & Proprietary Rights We regard substantial elements of our brands and underlying intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect them by relying on trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and transferring title and other methods. Our plans are to actively pursue patent and trademark protection for all newly developed products, both domestically and abroad. We have novel and proprietary technologies related to our product line and the central focus of our patent counsel has been successfully building a defensible set of patent claims which have been granted. To date, we have filed and received a United States federal trademark registration for trutankless® and our logo design with the help of our outside marketing and branding experts and have acquired several unique domain registrations reflective of our online marketing strategy (www.Trutankless.com).  During the year ended December 31, 2013, our patent agent filed a provisional patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office with the US Patent and Trademark Office with 37 claims based on our prototype design. Upon completion of our engineered prototype, we filed additional patents with additional claims. We have been able to obtain a formal patent for our tankless water heater with a total of 34 individual and dependent claims.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, our patent counsel filed a provisional patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the patent was granted with 14 claims based on our proprietary flowmeter design. We will continue to protect our intellectual property through confidentiality agreements with vendors and consultants and trade secret protocols employed by employees, consultants, and contractors. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our patent counsel collaborated with our engineering team to augment our research and development efforts related to future products which yielded positive results. By affirming our development path and product road map, we expect to file several new patents for novel technologies which we expect to launch in the future, including next generation electric tankless technologies along which will be designed to work with technologies that are able to employ artificial intelligence to help reduce water and energy consumption. We expect to receive additional benefits from our technology and data collection with cloud-based software as a service and apps which may be adapted for use by insurance companies, utilities, and municipalities.   7Table of Contents Growth Strategy Trutankless’ product launched in the first quarter of 2014 and was sold through the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. Gas tankless manufacturers’ support of this sales channel was critical in their ability to quickly capture appreciable market share in the replacement market estimated to be larger than $4 Billion nationwide. To our knowledge, no electric tankless has been available solely through wholesale distributors which welcomed the arrival of Trutankless. Trutankless’ sales and service training programs geared towards plumbers and contractors are the primary focal point of the Company’s sales strategy to quickly scale sales and educate distributors, plumbers, builders, and contractors. The company has also leveraged online marketing strategies and social media. By presenting an immersive and educational web experience at www.trutankless.com. Trutankless intends to continue building brand awareness among consumers efficiently online. Launch efforts are expected to be focused in Arizona, Texas, and the Southeast at first, which account for over 1,000,000 electric water heater shipments annually. Licensing and co-branding opportunities may be assessed, since strategic partnerships would eliminate the channel conflicts that have historically obstructed previous electric tankless entries in the marketplace. In addition, we have determined that as part of our growth strategy, we will seek to partner with or acquire entities operating in various fields, with a bias towards green and “clean-tech” sectors. Our management has experience in marketing, product launches, business development strategies, and certain other areas specific to the success of growth companies. We will operate with a view towards identifying acquisition candidates as we seek the rights to provide the market with products and services geared toward environmental responsibility, innovative technology in the plumbing industry, and home automation technology. Margin Expansion Cost reduction measures, including outsourcing of key components and certain quality control testing protocols, will be undertaken on an expedited basis to rapidly reduce costs and improve manufacturing scalability. Such reductions are expected to take place in stages over the next several quarters, and we believe may result in gross sales margins approaching 50% or more. Market Outlook Trutankless entered the market in front of the largest water heater replacement cycle ever at a time when homeowners were seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing comfort. Many of the heaters which were replaced at that time will need to be replaced, echoing the prior cycle. Statistics have shown a trend towards electric water heating in many markets as part of a trend known as “electrification”. This trend is part of a shift, which some municipalities are making mandatory, away from natural gas and other fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources, namely solar generated electricity among others which we expect to continue their proliferation throughout North America.  Florida, Texas, and Arizona, and areas where electric water heaters dominate the market, have been epicenters of the residential new construction strength in the US. In the new construction market, builders are increasingly marketing “green” features and trutankless fit well along with other energy saving innovations. In commercial markets, we feel that our commercial line of trutankless products is well suited to thousands of customers in the retail, quick serve and fast casual restaurants, hair salons, and other businesses with moderate hot water use required. In addition to residential new construction and replacement markets, we feel the commercial applications for which our products are appropriate represent a large portion of the commercial water heater market. In April 2015, the Federal Government mandated that standard electric water heaters over 55 gallons may not be sold (started effectively forcing the market to use alternative technologies like tankless water heaters. The electrification of the overall appliance market has also begun due to the rapid progression of energy generation technologies with more efficient and renewable energy sources seen as a growing and sustainable trend. Recent Developments On April 14, 2023, we announced a key product development milestone had been reached with entry into the engineering verification testing phase in the development of its second generation product. On May 11, 2023, the Company release further information relating to its next generation electric tankless, indicating improved performance over prior models with a completely reinvented mobile app. Further, the Company had engaged sales and marketing consultants with experience building integrated sales systems using the latest technology to incorporate lead generation, sales processes, tracking and forecasting with a proprietary app.  8Table of Contents On July 15, 2023, we announced the Company’s intention to spin-off its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tankless365, Inc. whereby each shareholder having common stock as of the distribution date will be entitled to receive shares of the common stock of Tankless365, Inc. pro rata based on a 4:1 ratio. The press release was attached as an exhibit to the Company’s 8-K filed with the SEC on July 19, 2023. On August 28, 2023 the Company filed a PRE 14C Preliminary Information Statement with the SEC, as amended in a PRER14C filed on August 30, 2023, to disclose the terms of the spinoff transaction announced in the July 15, 2023 press release and subsequent 8-K report. On September 12, 2023, the Company filed its’ DEF 14C Definitive Information Statement which was mailed to the Company’s shareholders of record with further disclosures giving notice to shareholder further describing the corporate actions including the terms of the spinoff and a name change authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. Target Markets The United States market for residential tank water heaters in 2022 was approximately 8.7 million units according to data released by the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). 52.5% of those shipments were electric storage water heater heaters, representing a 2.9% gain in market share versus gas storage water heaters in the prior year. We feel this is a good indicator that there is growing demand for electric solutions in the water heater market, which we expect will impact future sales for the Company’s electric tankless water heaters. Trutankless is initially marketing its products to contractors, home builders, remodelers, and distributors in the southern and western U.S. These areas of the country have been selected because of generally higher ground water temperatures, which improves the effects of the performance and capacity of all brands of tankless water heaters. This area of the country also traditionally has the largest share of population growth and new housing starts, accounting for almost two-thirds of all housing starts in 2019, according to recent data. Additionally, the southern U.S., and specifically the southeastern U.S., has the highest usage of electric water heaters. Distribution Plan Initially, we will be distributing our primary product lines throughout the southern and western U.S. using an existing network of plumbing and electrical wholesalers (distributors), manufacturers’ representatives and dealers. We believe that we will continue to build on existing relationships with major companies in the building and plumbing industries to rapidly expand awareness of Trutankless and our products in the water heater market in the U.S and Canada. Sales will continue to be pursued through the following channels:  1.Regional and national plumbing, HVAC, and electrical wholesalers (also called “distributors”); 2.Plumbers and electricians on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers have not yet been set up; and, 3.Builders on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers & mechanical contractors have not yet been set up. We intend to market to industry professionals and end-users through more traditional marketing efforts as well, including print advertising, attendance of select national trade shows, and attendance of select regional consumer shows. We also expect Trutankless will be successful in providing education, training, and support to our sales and installer networks as part of our distribution and marketing efforts. We believe our products will be a differentiating factor for industry professionals and builders as they market to their customers. Additionally, our electric tankless products are expected to provide these professionals and their companies with a mechanism to increase revenue and improve gross margin as compared to more traditional water heating products.  9Table of Contents Employees We currently have four employees, including our CEO and part-time employees. We expect to increase the number of employees to expand our sales and technical staff. We will continue to rely on independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating, general expenses and capital costs. Available Information Our periodic reports filed with the SEC, which include Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K and amendments thereto, may be accessed by the public free of charge from the SEC. Electronic copies of these reports can be accessed at the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

RISK FACTORS If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be harmed. If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Our employment relationships are generally at-will. We cannot assure that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. We intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business. We are subject to significant competition from large, well-funded companies. The industry we compete in is characterized by intense competition and rapid and significant technological advancements. Many companies are working in a number of areas similar to our primary field of interest to develop new products; some of which may be similar and/or competitive to our products. Most of the companies with which we compete have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution and other resources than us. If a competitor enters the tankless water heater industry and establishes a greater market share in the direct-selling channel, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors will lose their entire investment. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, stockholders will lose their investment.  We will be required to seek additional capital to fund future growth and expansion. No assurance can be given that such financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on commercially favorable terms. Moreover, favorable financing may be dilutive to investors. The outbreak of the recent coronavirus, COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate.  10Table of Contents We will require additional financing in order to implement our business plan. In the event we are unable to acquire additional financing, we may not be able to implement our business plan resulting in a loss of revenues and ultimately the loss of your investment. Due to our very recent start-up nature, we will have to incur the costs of product development, import expenses, advertising, in addition to hiring new employees and commencing additional marketing activities for product sales and distribution. To fully implement our business plan we will require substantial additional funding. We will need to raise additional funds to expand our operations. We plan to raise additional funds through private placements, registered offerings, debt financing or other sources to maintain and expand our operations. Adequate funds for this purpose on terms favorable to us may not be available, and if available, on terms significantly more adverse to us than are manageable. Without new funding, we may be only partially successful or completely unsuccessful in implementing our business plan, and our stockholders may lose part or all of their investment. Our internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. We have two individuals performing the functions of all officers and directors. Mr. Newman, our president and CEO, and Mr. Orr, our secretary and treasurer, have developed our internal control procedures and are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with those procedures. As a result, our internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. We depend on certain key employees, and believe the loss of any of them would have a material adverse effect on our business. We will be dependent on the continued services of our management team, as well as our outside consultants. While we have no assurance that our current management will produce successful operations, the loss of such personnel could have an adverse effect on meeting our production and financial performance objectives. We have no assurance that we will not lose the services of these or other key personnel and may not be able to timely replace any personnel if we do lose their services. Our ability to attract qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our future success, and any inability to attract such personnel could harm our business. Our future success may also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified design and sales and marketing personnel. We face competition for these individuals and may not be able to attract or retain these employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  11Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY If we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights, our products and competitors may be able to use our designs, each of which could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and increase our costs. We will rely on intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights with respect to our trademarks and pending patent. We are susceptible to injury from patent infringement, which may harm our reputation for producing high-quality products or force us to incur additional expense in enforcing our rights. It is difficult and expensive to detect and prevent patent infringement. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, some may attempt to violate our intellectual property rights by using our trademarks and imitating our products, which could potentially harm our brand, reputation and financial condition. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights. Infringement claims and lawsuits likely would be expensive to resolve and would require substantial management time and resources. Any adverse determination in litigation could subject us to the loss of our rights to a particular trademark, which could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain aspects of our products or could subject us to substantial liability, any of which would harm our results of operations. Aside from infringement claims against us, if we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to use our designs. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights or resolve any conflicts, our results Our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors. Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary nature of our technology. If a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology, despite the safeguards we have in place, it may be difficult, expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. In addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information. However, any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might harm our operating results. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK Because our common stock could remain under $4.00 per share, it could continue to be deemed a low-priced “Penny” stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions. Since our common stock is currently under $4.00 per share, it is considered a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment even if and when a market develops for the common stock. If the trading price of the common stock stays below $5.00 per share, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:  ·Deliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document; ·Disclose certain price information about the stock; ·Disclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer; ·Send monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and ·In some circumstances, approve the purchaser’s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to accept the common stock for deposit into an account or, if accepted for deposit, to sell the common stock and these restrictions may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.  12Table of Contents FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock. In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. Rule 15c2-11 as amended, effective on September 28, 2021, may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock. Our common stock trades on the Expert Market Tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TKLS” and is labeled as “Delinquent SEC Reporting.” The OTC Market is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information on current “bids” and “asks,” as well as volume information. Stock on the Expert Market is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes in stock on the Expert Market reflect unsolicited customer orders. Unsolicited-Only stocks, such as ours, have a higher risk of wider spreads between bid and asked quotations, increased volatility, and price dislocations. Investors may have difficulty selling our stock. An initial review by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule15c2-11 is required for brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making in our stock. The Expert Market serves broker-dealer pricing and investor best execution needs. Quotations in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing. OTC Markets Group designates securities for quoting on the Expert Market when the issuer has not disclosed its financial information for a period of slightly in excess of six months or is otherwise not making current information publicly available under SEC Rule 15c2-11, or when the security is otherwise restricted from public quoting. This designation by the OTC Markets Group severely limits the number of investors that might purchase shares of our common stock and effectively prevents the development of an active trading market in shares of our common stock. As a result, there currently is no established public trading market for the shares of our common stock. The common stock previously traded on the Pink Tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc.  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Our board of directors and senior management recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, business partners and employees. Our management, led by our Chief Executive Officer, is actively involved in oversight of our risk management efforts, and cybersecurity represents an important component of the Company’s overall approach to enterprise risk management (“ERM”). Our cybersecurity processes and practices are fully integrated into the Company’s ERM efforts. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. Risk Management and Strategy As one of the critical elements of our overall ERM approach, our cybersecurity efforts are focused on the following key areas:  ·Governance: Management oversees cybersecurity risk mitigation and reports to the board of directors any cybersecurity incidents. ·Collaborative Approach: We have implemented a cross-functional approach to identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. ·Technical Safeguards: We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-virus and anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence.   13Table of Contents We have not engaged third-party service providers to conduct evaluations of our security controls, independent audits or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. While we have not experienced any cybersecurity threats in the past in the normal course of business, in the future, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES During the year ended December 31, 2024 we maintained an executive office 15900 N.78th Street, Suite 200, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260, which consists of approximately 2,818 square feet and maintain a research, development, and test lab with office space 15953 N. Greenway Hayden Loop, Suite J, Scottsdale Arizona 85260, which consists of approximately 1,680 square feet.  ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. On July 6, 2020, we received a letter from the staff of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Staff”) that indicated the Company may have violated certain rules and regulations regarding a late filing notification filed by the Company and that the Staff would conduct an informal inquiry into the matter. On April 29, 2021, the Company agreed to pay civil penalties of $25,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission in settlement of the matter. As of December 31, 2024, $20,000 remained due. On April 6, 2023, the Company was served a Summons for an Amended Complaint filed in the state of Florida with claims for Strict Liability, Negligence and Breach of Implied Warranty. The complaint, filed by an insurance company, stems from its payments for claims filed by a policy holder on two separate occasions. The first insurance claim payment was due to a leak caused by improper installation in which the contractor failed to meet local codes. The second insurance claim payment followed the contractor’s failure to properly repair the improper installation. The complaint states that the contractor failed to follow basic installation guidelines supplied with the product in either incident, resulting in damages. On June 8, 2023, the Court of Duval County, FL entered a default judgement for $38,768. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not paid any of this balance. ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information From February 13, 2009, through approximately August 8, 2022, shares of our common stock traded on the OTC pink tier of the over-the counter market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TKLS”. On or about August 9, 2022, trading in shares of our common stock was downgraded on the OTC Pink tier of the over-the counter market operated by OTC Markets Group continuing under the symbol “TKLS”. On September 28, 2021, upon the effective date of amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act, trading in shares of our common stock became eligible only for unsolicited quotes on the Expert Market of the OTC Markets Group. Quotations in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing. This designation by the OTC Markets Group severely limits the number of investors that might purchase shares of our common stock and effectively prevents the development of an active trading market in shares of our common stock. As a result, there currently is no established public trading market for the shares of our common stock. Over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not necessarily reflect actual transactions. Even if upon or subsequent to filing this Form 10-K we are deemed current in filing financial and other information, there can be no assurance as to whether OTC Markets Group will enable shares of our common stock to be quoted on a retail tier or that the shares of our common stock can successfully be traded on other trading platforms. Holders of Common Stock As of December 31, 2024 there were approximately 480 stockholders of record of our common stock. This number does not include shares held by brokerage clearing houses, depositories or others in unregistered form. Dividends The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements, our financial condition, and other relevant factors. We have not paid or declared any dividends upon our common stock since our inception and, by reason of our present financial status and our contemplated financial requirements, do not anticipate paying any dividends upon our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends. We currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earnings in the development and expansion of our business. Any cash dividends in the future to common stockholders will be payable when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, based upon the Board’s assessment of:  ·our financial condition; ·earnings; ·need for funds; ·capital requirements; ·prior claims of preferred stock to the extent issued and outstanding; and ·other factors, including any applicable laws. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any dividends on the common stock will ever be paid.  15Table of Contents Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On January 18, 2024, the Company issued 1,050,000 shares pursuant to amendments to a related party promissory note which were made on October 20, 2021 On March 15, 2024, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares for a notice of conversion of a promissory note dated January 19, 2024. On March 15, 2024, the Company issued 750,000 shares for services.  On March 25, 2024, the Company settled a certain $385,000 convertible note and accrued interest dated February 22, 2022 for $250,000.   On April 5, 2024, the Company issued 36,893,398 shares to convert certain related party convertible notes dated July 26, 2022, June 15, 2023 and July 25, 2023. On April 11, 2024, the Company issued 3,857,143 share pursuant to a promissory note amendment and conversion dated April 3, 2024. On April 11, 2024 the Company issued 1,000,000 to for services. On April 22, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with an individual for a six-month period.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA This item is not applicable, as we are considered a smaller reporting company. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Background Trutankless Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and currently operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bollente, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on December 3, 2009 and Tankless365, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on October 20, 2021. Trutankless is involved in sales, marketing, research and development of a high quality, whole-house, smart electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. See “Item 1. Business.” RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues In the year ended December 31, 2024 we generated $242,350 in revenues, as compared to $3,549 in revenues in the prior year. The increase in sales was attributable to the initial launch of the next generation of our trutankless® residential and light commercial products. Cost of goods sold was $279,356, as compared to $0 in the prior year. To the knowledge of management, the Company is unaware of any trends or uncertainties in the sales or costs of our products and services for the periods discussed.  17Table of Contents  Expenses Operating expenses totaled $5,220,044 during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,345,917 in the prior year. In the year ended December 31, 2024, our expenses primarily consisted of General and Administrative of $783,359, Research and Development of $432,847, Professional Fees of $3,960,987 and Depreciation Expense of $3,845. General and administrative fees increased by $321,639 from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. General and administrative fees increased due to an increase in inventory write-off expense of $296,130, a decrease in payroll expenses of $640,717 and a decrease in expenses for a change in accounting estimation policy of $623,220 Research and Development increased by $216 from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. Research and Development fees increased as the Company completed Gen3 development and began the initial launch of this new generation of products. Professional fees increased $3,511,421 from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. Professional fees increased due to an increase in stock-based consulting fees.  Other Expenses Other expense increased by $4,157,952 to $4,966,058 in the year ended December 31, 2024 from $808,106 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was the result of an increase in financing incentive expense.  Net Loss In the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated a net loss of $10,186,102, an increase of $8,035,628 from $2,150,474 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was attributable to the factors discussed above. Going Concern The financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of the Company as a going concern. Management evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued and determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate revenues and raise capital. The Company has not generated sufficient revenues from product sales to provide sufficient cash flows to enable the Company to finance its operations internally. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1,004,190 and $21,452 cash on hand, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $77,101,969 and $66,915,867, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of $10,186,102 and $2,150,474, and cash used in operations of $2,315,411 and $1,990,470, respectively.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing. Over the next twelve months management plans to raise additional capital and to invest its working capital resources in sales and marketing in order to increase the distribution and demand for its products. However, there is no guarantee the Company will generate sufficient revenues or raise capital to continue operations. If the Company fails to generate sufficient revenue and obtain additional capital to continue at its expected level of operations, the Company may be forced to scale back or discontinue its sales and marketing efforts. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $77,101,969 and a working capital deficiency of $5,931,423. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,004,190 in cash.  18Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Annual Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:    Years ended   December 31, 2024  December 31, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities $(2,315,411 ) $(1,990,470 )Net cash used in investing activities  (191,917 )  - Net cash provided by financing activities  3,490,066   1,926,118 Net increase/(decrease) in Cash  982,738   (64,352 )Cash, beginning  21,452   85,804 Cash, ending $1,004,190  $21,452  Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was $2,315,411 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $1,990,470 used in operating activities for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss during the year ended December 31, 2024. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $191,917, as compared to $0 for the same period of 2023. The increase of net cash used in investing activities was mainly from the purchase of property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2024. Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3,490,066, as compared to $1,926,118 for the same period of 2023. The decrease of net cash provided by financing activities was mainly to a increase in debt financing during the year ended December 31, 2024. Ongoing Funding Requirements As of December 31, 2024, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing to provide the capital we need to run the business. It is possible that we may need additional funding to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we intend to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of those sources of funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.  19Table of Contents If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or relationships with third parties when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts; abandon our business strategy of growth through acquisitions; or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Critical Accounting Polices  In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This item in not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules appearing on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE We have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accounting or financial disclosures. ITEM 9A (T) CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, Guy Newman, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on his evaluation, Mr. Newman concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, as is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls.  Consequently, an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.  20Table of Contents Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made and in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).  Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with limited personnel:  ·inadequate controls over maintenance of records ·deficiencies in the period-end reporting process and accounting policies; ·inadequate internal controls relating to the authorization, recognition, capture, and review of transactions, facts, circumstances, and events that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial reporting process Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B.

He has sat on the Board of Directors for the Tempe Chamber of Commerce as well as other entrepreneurial organizations. He is currently on the Board of Directors for Project Sebastian, a rare disease research nonprofit, as well as he sits on the Sports Advisory Board for the Colangelo College of Business at Grand Canyon University. Guy Newman, (60) has been our Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director since April 2, 2024.

He worked in various retail brokerage firms in the 90's and 2000's and retired from the Brokerage Industry in 2011 to pursue management roles in a range of start-up ventures in the Boating and Construction industries. He has two adult sons. Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws both provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. Limitation of Liability of Directors Pursuant to the Nevada General Corporation Law, our Articles of Incorporation exclude personal liability for our Directors for monetary damages based upon any violation of their fiduciary duties as Directors, except as to liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or any transaction from which a Director receives an improper personal benefit. This exclusion of liability does not limit any right which a Director may have to be indemnified and does not affect any Director’s liability under federal or applicable state securities laws. We have agreed to indemnify our directors against expenses, judgments, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim against a Director if he acted in good faith and in a manner he believed to be in our best interests.  22Table of Contents Election of Directors and Officers Directors are elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until the meeting of the Board of Directors following the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations from our executive officers and directors, we believe that as of the date of this filing they were current in their filings. Code of Ethics A code of ethics relates to written standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:  1.Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 2.Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with, or submitted to, the Commission and in other public communications made by an issuer; 3.Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 4.The prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code; and 5.Accountability for adherence to the code. We have not adopted a corporate code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. Our decision not to adopt such a code of ethics results from our having a small management for the Company. We believe that the limited interaction which occurs having such a small management structure for the Company eliminates the current need for such a code, in that violations of such a code would be reported to the party generating the violation. Corporate Governance We currently do not have standing audit, nominating and compensation committees of the board of directors, or committees performing similar functions. Until formal committees are established, our entire board of directors, perform the same functions as an audit, nominating and compensation committee. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past five years:  ·been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences); ·had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time; ·been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; ·been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; ·been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or ·been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.  23Table of Contents ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Overview of Compensation Program We currently have not appointed members to serve on the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Until a formal committee is established, our entire Board of Directors has responsibility for establishing, implementing and continually monitoring adherence with the Company’s compensation philosophy. The Board of Directors ensures that the total compensation paid to the executives is fair, reasonable and competitive. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives The Board of Directors believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals by the Company and that aligns executives’ interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding performance above established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. As a result of the size of the Company and only having two officers, the Board evaluates both performance and compensation on an informal basis. Upon hiring additional executives, the Board intends to establish a Compensation Committee to evaluate both performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly-situated executives of peer companies. To that end, the Board believes executive compensation packages provided by the Company to its executives, including the named executive officers, should include both cash and stock-based compensation that reward performance as measured against established goals. Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions The Board of Directors makes all compensation decisions for, and approves recommendations regarding equity awards to, the executive officers and Directors of the Company. Decisions regarding the non-equity compensation of other employees of the Company are made by management. Summary Compensation Table The table below summarizes the total compensation paid to or earned by our current Executive Officers for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE Name and Principal Positions Year Salary($)  Bonus($)  StockAwards($)  OptionAwards($)  Non-EquityIncentivePlanCompensation($)  Non-Qualified DeferredCompensationEarnings($)  All OtherCompensation($)  Total($) Robertson James Orr 2023 $75,000  $-  $10  $-  $-  $-  $-  $75,010 Former President, Former CEO, Secretary, Treasurer & Director 2024 $75,000  $-  $124,500  $-  $-  $-  $-  $199,500 Michael Stebbins 2023  $157,500  $-  $410  $-  $-  $-  $-  $157,910 Former President & Former Director 2024 $-  $-  $-  $-  $-  $-  $-  $- Guy Newman 2023 $24,052  $-  $-  $-  $-  $-  $-  $- CEO, President & Director 2024 $168,288  $-  $1,450,000  $-  $-  $-  $-  $1,618,288   24Table of Contents Termination of Employment There are no compensatory plans or arrangements, including payments to be received from the Company, with respect to any person which would in any way result in payments to any such person because of his resignation, retirement, or other termination of such person’s employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, or any change in control of the Company, or a change in the person’s responsibilities following a change in control of the Company, except with respect to a breach of contract on the part of the Company. Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not grant any options to our officers and directors. Employment Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with the President/CEO to perform duties and responsibilities as may be assigned.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth information, to the best of our knowledge, about the beneficial ownership of our common stock on August 5, 2025 relating to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by those persons known to beneficially own more than 5% of our capital stock and by our directors and executive officers.  The percentage of beneficial ownership for the following table is based on 131,523,178 shares of common stock outstanding. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, beneficial ownership includes those shares of common stock over which the stockholder has sole or shared voting or investment power. It also includes shares of common stock that the stockholder has a right to acquire within 60 days after August 5, 2025, pursuant to options, warrants, conversion privileges or other rights. The percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock, however, is based on the assumption, expressly required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that only the person or entity whose ownership is being reported has converted options or warrants into shares of our common stock.  25Table of Contents Security Ownership of Management, Directors and Certain Beneficial Owners Title of ClassName of Beneficial Owner Number of SharesPercent Beneficially OwnedCommonRobertson James Orr - Secretary, Treasurer and Director3,365,5412.56%CommonGuy Newman - CEO, President and Director4,100,000 (3)3.12%CommonRodney J.

Orr     Robertson James Orr Director Date: August 27, 2025  31Table of Contents    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Trutankless, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trutankless, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (restated), and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows, for the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (restated), and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (restated), and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (restated), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (restated), the Company had an accumulated deficit of $77,101,969, and $66,915,867 respectively. The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs for the next twelve (12) months. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Board of Directors (audit committee equivalent) and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. VICTOR MOKUOLU, CPA PLLCWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.Houston, Texas August 27, 2025PCAOB ID: 6771    F-1Table of Contents  TRUTANKLESS, INCCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS   December 31, 2024  December 31, 2023      (Restated) ASSETS      Current assets      Cash $1,004,190  $21,452 Accounts receivable  43,523   - Prepaid expenses  1,232,930   5,000 Inventory  350,866   - Vendor deposits  375,652   - Total current assets  3,007,161   26,452          Other assets        Property, plant and equipment, net  188,072   - Right-to-use asset  171,016   203,477 Trademarks  11,914   11,914 Other assets  18,947   13,947 Total other assets  389,949   229,338 Total assets $3,397,110  $255,790          LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT        Current liabilities        Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $1,232,483  $915,334 Advances payable -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OrganizationThe Company was incorporated on March 7, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Alcantara Brands Corporation. On October 5, 2010, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Bollente Companies, Inc. On June 4, 2018, the Company amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Trutankless, Inc. The Company is involved in sales, marketing, research and development of a high quality, whole-house, smart electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. Management anticipates the Company’s trutankless water heater, with Wi-Fi capability and Trutankless’ proprietary apps offered in the iOS and Android store, will augment existing products in the home automation space. Principles of consolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Trutankless, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. On May 16, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bollente, Inc. On August 20th, 2020 the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Notation Labs, Inc. On October 20, 2021, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Tankless365, Inc. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Spinoff - On January 24, 2022, the Company completed the previously announced spin-off of its subsidiary Notation Labs Inc into a stand-alone company. The historical results of Notation Labs Inc that were contributed to Trutankless Inc in the spinoff have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements through the date of the spinoff and in the prior year periods as the spinoff represents a strategic shift in our business that has a major effect on operations and financial results. As of December 31, 2022, the assets and liabilities associated with Notation Labs Inc. are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet. The disclosures presented in our notes to the consolidated financial statements are presented on a continuing operations basis. On July 15, 2023, the Company announced its intention to spin-off its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tankless365, Inc. On a date determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, each Shareholder having common stock as of the Distribution Date will be entitled to receive shares of the common stock of Tankless365, Inc. pro rata based on a 4:1 ratio. Subsequent to this announcement, the Company’s management decided that the subsidiary, Tankless 365, Inc. will not be spun-off but will remain as a subsidiary of the Company. Early in 2024, the Company made the decision to reverse this decision and keep Tankless365, Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. Use of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  Change in accounting policyDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company changed its policy regarding unissued stock. Previously, the Company had used a last in, first out method for estimating its stock payable balance. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company changed to a first in, first out method for estimating the stock payable balance. This resulted in a credit to general and administrative expenses of $623,220 during the year ended December 31, 2023.  F-6Table of Contents  Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value. Stock-based compensationThe Company follows ASC 718-10, “Stock Compensation”, which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.  Income TaxesThe Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from management’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Earnings per shareThe Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation. There are 13,632,379 additional shares issuable in connection with outstanding warrants, stock payable, and convertible debts as of December 31, 2024. Accounts receivableAccounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded.  Advertising Costs The Company’s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expenses of $10,468 and $16,416 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  F-7Table of Contents  Research and development costs The Company charges research and development costs to expense when incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 730, “Research and Development”. These research and development expenses are not related to the patent that the Company has, but are focused on future product developments. Research and development costs were $432,847 and $432,631 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  InventoryInventory, including manufacturing cost and shipping are stated at the lower of cost (average cost) or market (net realizable value). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Company implemented maintaining a vendor managed inventory at its contract manufacturer’s facility that is managed by this third party. The Company has been improving its inventory tracking by putting in procedures to track all costs related to inventory assets and performing period end counts on a regular basis. Revenue recognitionRevenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue recognition occurs at the time product is shipped to customers, when control transfers to customers, provided there are no material remaining performance obligations required of the Company or any matters of customer acceptance. Fair value of financial instrumentsThe Company measures fair value in accordance with ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are: Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 - Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life. Level 3 - Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Valuation of instruments includes unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. As defined by ASC 820, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale, which was further clarified as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (“an exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  F-8Table of Contents    The reported fair values for financial instruments that use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of factors and assumptions. Accordingly, certain fair values may not represent actual values of the Company’s financial instruments that could have been realized as December 31, 2024 or that will be recognized in the future, and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual settlement. The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, receivables from related parties, prepaid expenses and other, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and related party and third-party notes payables approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Company’s notes payable to related parties approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management’s best estimate of terms that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon adoption.  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Management evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued and determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate revenues and raise capital. The Company has not generated sufficient revenues from product sales to provide sufficient cash flows to enable the Company to finance its operations internally. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1,004,190 and $21,452 cash on hand, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has a working capital deficit of $5,931,423 and $7,377,231, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $77,101,969 and $66,915,867, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of $10,186,102 and $2,150,474 and cash used in operations of $2,348,061 and $1,990,470, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing. Over the next twelve months management plans to raise additional capital and to invest its working capital resources in sales and marketing in order to increase the distribution and demand for its products. However, there is no guarantee the Company will generate sufficient revenues or raise capital to continue operations. If the Company fails to generate sufficient revenue and obtain additional capital to continue at its expected level of operations, the Company may be forced to scale back or discontinue its sales and marketing efforts. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET Accounts receivable consist of the following at:   December 31, 2024  December 31, 2023 Accounts receivable  43,523   186,750 Allowance for doubtful accounts  -   (186,750)Total $43,523  $-   NOTE 4 - PREPAID EXPENSES Prepaid expenses consist of the following at:   December 31, 2024  December 31, 2023 Prepaid legal fees  -   5,000 Prepaid filing fees  1,246   - Prepaid stock-based compensation  1,231,684   - Total $1,232,930  $5,000  Prepaid stock-based compensation consisted of stock issuances for 30 consulting agreements that are being amortized over the life of the agreements.

The Company elected the transition relief package of practical expedients, and as a result, we did not assess 1) whether existing or expired contracts contain embedded leases, 2) lease classification for any existing or expired leases, and 3) whether lease origination costs qualified as initial direct costs. We elected the short-term lease practical expedient by establishing an accounting policy to exclude leases with a term of 12 months or less. During 2018, the Company executed a lease agreement. The lease term is 39 months at a rate of $1,680 per month with 3% increases beginning January 1, 2021 and rent commencing on January 1, 2019. The Company was required to pay a $1,781 security deposit. During the year ending December 31, 2022 the Company agreed to renew the lease through December 31, 2025. During the year ended December 2024, the Company stopped using this space and was looking for a party to sublease the space.

The Company was released from the remaining lease as of January 31, 2025. In January 2023, the Company executed a lease agreement.

Notation Labs and the Company have continued to share office and warehouse spaces. The agreement is that Notation Labs pays portions of the leases based on agreements between the two companies for usage and other factors. Notation Labs paid $82,324 of the lease liabilities in 2023. The Company does not recognize rent expense on this amount nor is it required to repay Notation Labs. The discount rate utilized for classification and measurement purposes as of the inception date of the lease is based on the Company’s collateralized incremental interest rate to borrow of 12%, as the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable.  F-16Table of Contents  Undiscounted Cash Flows As of December 31, 2024, the right of use asset and lease liability were shown on the consolidated balance sheet at $171,016 and $171,016, respectively.

The complaint, filed by an insurance company, stems from its payments for claims filed by a policy holder on two separate occasions. The first insurance claim payment was due to a leak caused by improper installation in which the contractor failed to meet local codes. The second insurance claim payment followed the contractor’s failure to properly repair the improper installation. The complaint states that the contractor failed to follow basic installation guidelines supplied with the product in either incident, resulting in damages.

The current year’s net operating loss will carryforward indefinitely, limited to 80% of the current year taxable income. The deferred income tax asset is derived by taking the net operating loss carryforward of $77,101,969 times the 21% effective tax rate totaling $16,191,413. The current income tax benefit of $2,191,571 generated for the year ended December 31, 2024 was offset by an equal increase in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was increased due to uncertainties as to the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards which is the only significant component of deferred taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company has no unrecognized uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.  NOTE 12 – FINANCING INCENTIVE During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 16,890,000 shares of common stock as financing incentives to lenders to encourage these lenders to enter note agreements and also for a related party lender to agree to a standby letter of credit required under the Company’s agreement with its contract manufacturer.
