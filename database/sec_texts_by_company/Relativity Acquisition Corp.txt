Table of ContentsEXPLANATORY NOTERelativity Acquisition Corp.

In accordance with ASC 230-10-45 the correct presentation should reflect cash withdrawn from the Trust Account as an investing cash inflow, as it represents a release of funds previously classified as investing assets and cash used to redeem ClassÂ A ordinary shares as a financing cash outflow, as it reflects a return of capital to shareholders and a reduction of the Companyâs equity.As a result of this error, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in RulesÂ 13a-15(e)Â and 15d-15(e)Â of the Exchange Act, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation of its statements of cash flows. We performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. To address this material weakness, management has devoted, and plans to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of its internal controls over financial reporting.âââ

Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,â includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of SectionÂ 27A of the Securities Act (as defined below) and SectionÂ 21E of the Exchange Act (as defined below). These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words âbelieves,â âestimates,â âanticipates,â âexpects,â âintends,â âplans,â âmay,â âwill,â âpotential,â âprojects,â âpredicts,â âcontinue,â or âshould,â or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other Business Combination (as defined below) and any other statements that are not statements of current or historical facts. These statements are based on Managementâs (as defined below) current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to:âthe Company has until February 15, 2026 (absent any extensions of such period, pursuant to the terms described above) to consummate the proposed Business Combination. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate the proposed Business Combination by this date (as further described below â Initial Business Combination);âour ability to complete our initial Business Combination(as defined below);âour expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses (as defined below);âour success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial Business Combination;âour officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial Business Combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements;âthe potential incentive to consummate an initial Business Combination with an acquisition target that subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for public investors due to the low initial price for the Founder Shares (as defined below) paid by our Initial Stockholders (as defined below);âour potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination;âthe ability of our officers and directors to generate additional potential acquisition opportunities, if necessary;âour pool of prospective target businesses;âour public securitiesâ potential liquidity and trading is uncertain, as it is unknown when the Trading Halt (as defined below) issued pursuant to the Determination Letter (as defined below) will be lifted;âthe lack of a market for our securities;âthe use of proceeds not held in the Trust Account (as defined below) or available to us from interest income on the Trust Account balance;âthe Trust Account not being subject to claims of third parties;âour financial performance; orâthe other risks and uncertainties discussed in âItem 1A.

Table of ContentsPARTÂ IItemÂ 1. Business.OverviewWe are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting our initial Business Combination.While we have focused on targets in the legalized cannabis industry, we have also actively explored Business Combination targets in other businesses, industries or geographical locations, including, but not limited to, related industries such as consumer packaged goods, healthÂ & wellness, technology, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, distribution, logistics and brand management. On FebruaryÂ 13, 2023, we entered into the SVES Business Combination Agreement, as more fully disclosed under âSVES Business Combinationâ below.Â On MayÂ 14, 2024 the SVES Business Combination was mutually terminated.Initial Public OfferingOn FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 14,375,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Public Share and one Public Warrant, with each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of ClassÂ A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $143,750,000.Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 653,750 Private Placement Units to our Sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $6,537,500.A total of $146,625,000, including $143,750,000 of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and $2,875,000 of the proceeds of the Private Placement, was placed in the Trust Account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee, at the consummation of the Initial Public Offering.It is the job of our Sponsor and Management Team to complete our initial Business Combination. Our Management Team is led by Tarek K. Tabsh, our Chief Executive Officer, and Steven Berg, our Chief Financial Officer. We must complete our initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. If our initial Business Combination is not consummated during the Combination Period, unless we seek further extension of the Combination Period, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account.SVES Business CombinationOn FebruaryÂ 13, 2023, we entered into the SVES Business Combination Agreement by and among the SVES Business Combination Parties.On MayÂ 14, 2024, the SVES Business Combination Agreement was mutually terminated as per the termination clause of the SVES Business Combination Agreement. As per the termination clause of the SVES Business Combination Agreement, all further obligations of the parties under the SVES Business Combination Agreement (except for certain obligations related to publicity, confidentiality, fees and expenses, trust fund waiver, no recourse, termination and general provisions) have terminated, and no party to the SVES Business Combination Agreement has any further liability to any other party thereto except for liability for fraud.Extension of our Combination PeriodWe initially had up to 12Â monthsÂ from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (until FebruaryÂ 15, 2023) to complete a Business Combination, except that the Sponsor had two 3-monthÂ extensions available to it, for a total of up to 18Â months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (until AugustÂ 15, 2023) to complete the initial Business Combination.We have extended our time to complete a business combination three times, with our stockholders having the ability to redeem each time. We currently have until FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 to consummate an initial Business Combination (subject to further extension with the approval of stockholders pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Charter, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules). Following such redemptions, there are currently 62,488 Public Shares outstanding and a total of 4,309,988 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common stock outstanding.1
Table of ContentsInstinct Brothers Co., Ltd Business CombinationOn FebruaryÂ 28, 2025, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the âBusiness Combination Agreementâ) by and among (i)Â Relativity Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (together with its successors, the âPurchaserâ), (ii)Â Relativity HoldingsÂ Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (âPubcoâ), (iii)Â Relativity Purchaser Merger Sub IIÂ Inc., a company to be formed in the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco (the âMerger Subâ and the Merger Sub, collectively with the Purchaser and Pubco, the âPurchaser Partiesâ), (iv)Â Instinct Brothers Co., Ltd, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (an âOperating Companyâ and âTarget Companyâ) and its shareholder named on Annex I hereto ( âSellerâ), (vi)Â Tomoki Nagano (âFounderâ), (vii)Â Relativity Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative for the stockholders of Pubco (other than the Seller) (the âPurchaser Representativeâ), and (viii)Â Tomoki Nagano in the capacity as the representative for the Seller (the âSeller Representativeâ). The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to herein as the âTransaction.âPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (a)Â the Merger Sub will merge with and into Relativity, with Relativity surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and (b)Â each Seller shall contribute all of its ownership interests in each Operating Company to Pubco in exchange for aggregate consideration in the amount of $200,000,000 (the âContribution Considerationâ), to be paid in the common stock of Pubco valued at $10.00 per share of common stock. At the Closing, each public warrant of Relativity shall be converted into one Pubco public warrant and each private warrant of Relativity shall be converted into one Pubco private warrant, in each case with such Pubco warrant having substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the respective Relativity warrants, except that in each case they shall represent the right to acquire shares of Pubco common stock in lieu of shares of Relativity ClassÂ A common stock.The obligations of the parties to complete the Closing are subject to various conditions. We are working toward completing the proposed business combination as soon as possible.Initial Business CombinationNasdaq rulesÂ require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred fee payable to A.G.P. pursuant to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a targetâs assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.2
Table of ContentsWe have until FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 to consummate an initial Business Combination (subject to further extension with the approval of stockholders pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Charter, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules). If we are unable to consummate an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination either (i)Â in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii)Â in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target Management Team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaqâs 80% of net assets test. If the initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.Our Management TeamMembers of our Management Team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any member of our Management Team devotes in any time period has varied based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.Our Management Teamâs operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies has provided us with a substantial number of potential Business Combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our Management Team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships in various industries. This network has grown through the activities of our Management Team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our Management Teamâs relationships with sellers, financing sources and target Management Teams and the experience of our Management Team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.Status as a Public CompanyOur structure as a public company makes us an attractive Business Combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a Business Combination with us. Following an initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholdersâ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a Business Combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical Initial Public Offering. The typical Initial Public Offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical Business Combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the Initial Public Offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial Business Combination with us.3
Table of ContentsFurthermore, once a proposed initial Business Combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwritersâ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholdersâ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a companyâs profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.While we believe that our structure and our Management Teamâs backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our requirement to obtain stockholder approval of any proposed initial Business Combination, negatively.Effecting Our Initial Business CombinationWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial Business Combination. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering (after redemptions and net of any taxes payable) and the Private Placement of the Private Placement Units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination (including pursuant to any forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, lines of credit arranged by the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our ClassÂ A Common Stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial Business Combination. In the case of an initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.4
Table of ContentsSources of Target BusinessesTarget business candidates have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus in connection with our Initial Public Offering or this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we are supported by A.G.P. and its team of investment banking professionals, each of whom have meaningful transaction experience, including in corporate finance, Business Combinations and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, strategic consulting and operations. A.G.P. has developed an extensive network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe provides us with an important source of initial Business Combination opportunities. The collective experience, capability and network of our founders, directors and officers, and A.G. P. combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, has helped to create prospective Business Combination opportunities. We received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their affiliates. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finderâs fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an armâs length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will only pay a finderâs fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to the extent such payment would be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We will engage a finder only to the extent our Management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our Management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finderâs fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our Sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finderâs fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, are allowed to receive any compensation, finderâs fees or consulting fees from a prospective Business Combination target in connection with a contemplated initial Business Combination. We agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of $10,000 perÂ month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement and reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial Business Combination. Such fees has been accrued since DecemberÂ 2023. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial Business Combination candidate.We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with an initial Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such Business Combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.5
Table of ContentsSelection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business CombinationNasdaq rulesÂ require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred fee payable to A.G.P. pursuant to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our initial Business Combination will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a targetâs assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our Management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.In any case, we will only complete an initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaqâs 80% of net assets test.To the extent we consummate our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our Management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.In evaluating a prospective business target, we continue to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent Management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.The time required to complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.Lack of Business DiversificationFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete Business Combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we have focused and will continue to focus our search for an initial Business Combination in a single industry. By completing our initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:âsubject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial Business Combination, andâcause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.6
Table of ContentsLimited Ability to Evaluate the Targetâs Management TeamAlthough we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target businessâ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our Management Team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our Management Team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure our stockholders that members of our Management Team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of a particular target business.We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial Business Combination.Following an initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent Management of the target business. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent Management.Stockholders MayÂ Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business CombinationWe may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rulesÂ of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.âââType of TransactionÂ Â Â Â WhetherStockholderApproval IsRequiredPurchase of assetsÂ NoPurchase of stock of target not involving a Business Combination with our CompanyÂ NoBusiness Combination of target into a subsidiary of our CompanyÂ NoBusiness Combination of our Company with a targetÂ YesâUnder Nasdaqâs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial Business Combination if, for example:âwe issue shares of Class A Common Stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding;âany of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of Common Stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; orâthe issuance or potential issuance of Common Stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.7
Table of ContentsPermitted Purchases of our SecuritiesIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, Initial Stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of Public Shares our Initial Stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rulesÂ under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rulesÂ under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to SectionÂ 13 and SectionÂ 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial Business Combination.The purpose of any such purchases of Public Shares could be to vote such Public Shares in favor of the initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such Public Warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public âfloatâ of our Public Shares or Public Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial Business Combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase Public Shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under RuleÂ 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with RuleÂ 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under SectionÂ 9(a)(2)Â and RuleÂ 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. RuleÂ 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of Public Shares if the purchases would violate SectionÂ 9(a)(2)Â or RuleÂ 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to SectionÂ 13 and SectionÂ 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business CombinationWe will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two businessÂ days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account was approximately $11.41 per Public Share as of DecemberÂ 31, 2023. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred fee payable to A.G.P. pursuant to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement. Our Initial Stockholders, and our officers and directors, have entered into the Letter Agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock held by them, whether now or hereafter acquired, in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.8
Table of ContentsManner of Conducting RedemptionsWe will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i)Â in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii)Â by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct Business Combinations with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock or seek to amend our Second Amended and Restated Charter would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial Business Combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rulesÂ of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Charter:âconduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, andâfile tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.Upon the public announcement of our initial Business Combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with RuleÂ 10b5-1 to purchase Public Shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with RuleÂ 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 businessÂ days, in accordance with RuleÂ 14e-1(a)Â under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial Business Combination and after payment of underwritersâ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SECâs âpenny stockâ rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial Business Combination. If Public Stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial Business Combination.If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Charter:âconduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, andâfile proxy materials with the SEC.In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial Business Combination.9
Table of ContentsIf we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Initial Stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the Letter Agreement our Initial Stockholders, and our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, Private Placement Shares, and any Public Shares purchased during or after our Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result of the Founder Share Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the stockholder votes on the First Extension and Second Extension, our Sponsorâs holdings constitute approximately 96.52% of the voting power of our outstanding Common Stock; consequently, unless otherwise required under applicable law, we would not need any of the 153,295 outstanding Public Shares to be voted in favor of an initial Business Combination in order to have our initial Business Combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30Â days (but not less than 10Â days nor more than 60Â days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Initial Stockholders, make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.Our Second Amended and Restated Charter provides that we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial Business Combination and after payment of underwritersâ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SECâs âpenny stockâ rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed initial Business Combination may require: (i)Â cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii)Â cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii)Â the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption RightsWe may require our Public Stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their Public Shares in âstreet name,â to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two businessÂ days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial Business Combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holderâs option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to our Public Shareholders in connection with our initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring Public Stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a Public Stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to twoÂ days prior to the vote on the initial Business Combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares.There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.10
Table of ContentsThe foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their Business Combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholdersâ vote on an initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial Business Combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial Business Combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an âoption windowâ after the completion of the initial Business Combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companyâs stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become âoptionâ rights surviving past the completion of the initial Business Combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holderâs election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial Business Combination is approved.Any request to redeem such Public Shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a Public Shareholder delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial Business Combination.If our initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by Public Stockholders who elected to redeem their Public Shares.If our initial proposed initial Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial Business Combination with a different target until the end of the Combination Period.Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business CombinationOur Second Amended and Restated Charter provides that we will have until the end of the Combination Period to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination during the Combination Period, we will: (i)Â cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten businessÂ days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholdersâ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period.Our Initial Stockholders, and our officers and directors, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period. However, if our Sponsor, officers or directors acquire Public Shares in or after our Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period.11
Table of ContentsAdditionally, our Initial Stockholders, and our officers and directors, agreed, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Charter (i)Â to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period or (ii)Â with respect to any other provision relating to stockholdersâ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial Business Combination and after payment of underwritersâ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SECâs âpenny stockâ rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of Public Shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our Public Shares at such time.If we do not consummate our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $7,131 of proceeds that was held outside the Trust Account as of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, although we cannot assure our stockholders that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by Public Stockholders upon our dissolution is anticipated to be approximately $11.41 as of DecemberÂ 31, 2023. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our Public Stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that the actual per-share redemption amount received by Public Stockholders will not be substantially less than $11.41. Under SectionÂ 281(b)Â of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditorsâ claims.Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our Public Stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our Management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if Management believes that such third partyâs engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by Management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where Management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Withum, our independent registered public accounting firm, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.12
Table of ContentsIn addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i)Â $10.20 per Public Share and (ii)Â the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsorâs only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure our stockholders that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i)Â $10.20 per Public Share or (ii)Â such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure our stockholders that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure our stockholders that, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per Public Share.We seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, we had access to $7,131 of proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement that is held outside of the Trust Account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000) as well as expenses incurred as a result of being a public company or in connection with identifying and conducting due diligence on a target for an initial Business Combination.Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in SectionÂ 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholderâs pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.13
Table of ContentsFurthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to SectionÂ 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be sixÂ years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of threeÂ years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i)Â cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten businessÂ days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholdersâ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.Because we will not be complying with SectionÂ 280, SectionÂ 281(b)Â of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10Â years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement in connection with the Initial Public Offering, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i)Â $10.20 per Public Share or (ii)Â such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure our stockholders we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our Public Stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a âpreferential transferâ or a âfraudulent conveyance.â As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board of Directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure our stockholders that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.Our Public Stockholders are entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i)Â the completion of our initial Business Combination, (ii)Â the redemption of any Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Charter (A)Â to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period or (B)Â with respect to any other provision relating to stockholdersâ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity and (iii)Â the redemption of all of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete our Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial Business Combination, a stockholderâs voting in connection with the initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholderâs redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Charter, like all provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Charter, may be amended with a stockholder vote.14
Table of ContentsCompetitionIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic Business Combinations. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.EmployeesWe currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.Periodic Reporting and Financial InformationOur Units, Public Shares and Warrants were registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we plan on registering our Units, Public Shares, Warrants and to continue with our reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by Withum, our independent registered public accounting firm.We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials, to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial Business Combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rulesÂ and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure our stockholders that any particular target business identified by us as a potential Business Combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential Business Combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscalÂ year ending DecemberÂ 31, 2023, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such Business Combination.We plan on filing another Registration Statement on FormÂ 8-AÂ with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under SectionÂ 12 of the ExchangeÂ Act. As a result, we will again be subject to the rulesÂ and regulations promulgated under the ExchangeÂ Act. We have no current intention of filing a FormÂ 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the ExchangeÂ Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial Business Combination.We are an âemerging growth company,â as defined in SectionÂ 2(a)Â of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not âemerging growth companiesâ including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of SectionÂ 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyÂ Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-bindingÂ advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.15
Table of ContentsIn addition, SectionÂ 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an âemerging growth companyâ can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in SectionÂ 7(a)(2)(B)Â of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an âemerging growth companyâ can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)Â the lastÂ day of the fiscalÂ year (a)Â following FebruaryÂ 15, 2027, (b)Â in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235Â billion, or (c)Â in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of ClassÂ  A Common Stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700Â million as of the prior JuneÂ 30th, and (2)Â the date on which we have issued more than $1.0Â billion in non-convertibleÂ debt securities during the prior three-yearÂ period.Additionally, we are a âsmaller reporting companyâ as defined in ItemÂ 10(f)(1)Â of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only twoÂ years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscalÂ year in which (i)Â the market value of our Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliatesÂ exceeds $250Â million as of the prior JuneÂ 30th, and (ii)Â our annual revenues exceed $100Â million during such completed fiscalÂ year or the market value of our Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliatesÂ exceeds $700Â million as of the prior JuneÂ 30.ItemÂ 1A. Risk Factors.As a smaller reporting company under RuleÂ 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K, and on our FormÂ S-1 that was filed on JanuaryÂ 28, 2022, along with amendments thereto with the SEC, which is incorporated by reference, before you decide to invest in our securities. However, the following is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on us and our operations:âwe are a blank check company and an early stage company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target;âwe may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial Business Combination in the prescribed time frame;âour expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, may not be realized;âwe may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial Business Combination;âour officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between our Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial Business Combination;âwe may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination, or reduce the number of stockholders requesting redemption;âwe may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial Business Combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time;âour stockholders may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial Business Combination;âTrust Account funds may not be protected against third-party claims or bankruptcy;âour public securitiesâ potential liquidity and trading is uncertain, as it is unknown when the Trading Halt issued pursuant to the Determination Letter will be lifted;âan active market for our public securities may not exist and our stockholders will have limited liquidity and trading;16
Table of Contentsâthe availability to us of funds from interest income on the Trust Account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the Business Combination;âour financial performance following a Business Combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack of an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management;âthere may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial Business Combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial Business Combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target;âchanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial Business Combination;âwe may attempt to simultaneously complete Business Combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial Business Combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability;âwe have entered into the Business Combination Marketing Agreement with A.G.P. to act as an advisor to us after the Initial Public Offering in connection with an initial Business Combination. A.G.P. is entitled to a fee in connection with that Business Combination Marketing Agreement that will be payable from the Trust Account only upon a completion of an initial Business Combination. In addition, we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial Business Combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial Business Combination;âwe may attempt to complete our initial Business Combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a Business Combination with a company that is not as profitable as we anticipated, if at all;âour Warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination;âsince our Initial Stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial Business Combination is not completed (other than with respect to any Public Shares they may acquire during or after our Initial Public Offering), and because our Sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our Public Stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular Business Combination target is appropriate for our initial Business Combination;âchanges in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations;âthe value of the Founder Shares following completion of our initial Business Combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our Common Stock at such time is substantially less than $11.41 per share;âresources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to identify and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, our Public Stockholders may receive only approximately $11.25 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account, and our Warrants will expire worthless;âin March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential Business Combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial Business Combination and may constrain the circumstances 17
Table of Contentsunder which we could complete an initial Business Combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the Trust Account or liquidate our Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose;âif we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial Business Combination and instead liquidate our Company;âto mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, and following the approval by our stockholders of the Trust Agreement Amendment at the 2024 Special Meeting, on February 13, 2024, we instructed Continental, as trustee of the Trust Account, to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, we may receive less interest on the funds held in the Trust Account than the interest we would have received pursuant to our original Trust Account investments, which could reduce the dollar amount our Public Stockholders receive upon any redemption or our liquidation;âwe may not be able to complete an initial Business Combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States;ârecent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination;âmarket conditions, economic uncertainty or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate a Business Combination;âadverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects;âmilitary or other conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East or elsewhere may lead to increased volume and price volatility for publicly traded securities, or affect the operations or financial condition of potential target companies, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination;âthe Excise Tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a Business Combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption;âthere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a âgoing concernâ.For additional risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth above, see the section titled âRisk Factorsâ contained in our (i)Â IPO Registration Statement, (ii)Â 2022 Annual Report and 2021 Annual Report, (iii)Â Quarterly Reports on FormÂ 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended MarchÂ 31, 2022, JuneÂ 30, 2022, SeptemberÂ 30, 2022, MarchÂ 31, 2023, and SeptemberÂ 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on MayÂ 16, 2022, AugustÂ 15, 2022, NovemberÂ 14, 2022, MayÂ 15, 2023, and NovemberÂ 20, 2023, respectively, and (iv)Â Definitive Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, as filed with the SEC on DecemberÂ 5, 2022 and JanuaryÂ 31, 2024, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.ItemÂ 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.Not applicable.18
Table of ContentsItemÂ 1C. CybersecurityWe are a blank check company with no business operations. Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable target businesses for an initial business combination. Therefore, we do not believe that we face significant cybersecurity risks and have not adopted anyÂ cybersecurityÂ risk management programs or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk. Our board of directors is generally responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, if any. In fiscalÂ year 2023, we did not identify anyÂ cybersecurityÂ threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.Once we are operational and have available funding, we will be committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems and data. As part of this commitment, we plan to implement a comprehensiveÂ cybersecurityÂ program to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of our information assets.ItemÂ 2. Properties.Our executive offices are located at 3753 Howard Hughes Pkwy, SuiteÂ 200, Las Vegas, NV 89169, and our telephone number is 888-710-4420. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 perÂ month fee we agreed to pay to an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services, pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement. Such fee has been accrued since DecemberÂ 2023. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.ItemÂ 3.

Table of ContentsPARTÂ IIItemÂ 5. Market for Registrantâs Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.(a)Market InformationOn JanuaryÂ 11, 2023, Nasdaq determined to halt trading in our securities and on JuneÂ 3, 2024, Nasdaq filed a form 25-NSE removing and delisting our securities from Nasdaq and SectionÂ 12b of the Securities and Exchange Act. Our securities are not currently trading. Prior to JanuaryÂ 11, 2023, our Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants were each traded on Nasdaq under the symbols âRACYU,â âRACYâ and âRACYW,â respectively. Our Units commenced public trading on FebruaryÂ 11, 2022, and our Public Shares and Public Warrants commenced separate public trading on AprilÂ 4, 2022.(b)HoldersOn MarchÂ XX, 2025, there were two holders of record of our Units, one of record of shares of our ClassÂ A Common Stock and one holder of record of our Warrants.(c)DividendsWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial Business Combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial Business Combination will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors at such time. In addition, our Board of Directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial Business Combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.(d)Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation PlansNone.(e)Recent Sales of Unregistered SecuritiesOn FebruaryÂ 27, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 3,593,749Â shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock to our Sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of the Founder Shares, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of ClassÂ B Common Stock in the Founder Share Conversion. These shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the ClassÂ B Common Stock before the Founder Share Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Registration Statement; consequently, the shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock issued in connection with the Founder Share Conversion are not registered under the Securities Act and will remain unregistered until registration is demanded by the Sponsor pursuant to the Letter Agreement. Following the Founder Share Conversion, our Sponsor was the beneficial owner of 3,033,905 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common Stock. The Sponsor then transferred 533,525 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock to certain members of the Sponsor.Subsequent to those transfers and the Founder Sharer Conversion, the Sponsor currently holds 2,500,380 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common Stock, as well as 653,750Â shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock that are part of Private Placement Units that were acquired by the Sponsor in the Private Placement.(f)Use of Proceeds from the Initial Public OfferingFor a description of the use of proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, see PartÂ II, ItemÂ 5 of our 2021 Annual Report. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration Statement. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time.20
Table of ContentsFollowing the approval by our stockholders of the Trust Agreement Amendment at the 2024 Special Meeting, on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, we instructed Continental to liquidate theÂ investmentsÂ held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Morgan Stanley, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation ofÂ investmentsÂ in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds.(g)Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated PurchasersOn FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, we held a special meeting, at which our stockholders approved, among other things, the Third Extension. In connection with the vote to approve the Second Extension, Public Stockholders holding 90,054 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately $1.02 million (approximately $11.32 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders, leaving $715,760.63 in the Trust Account.On FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders approved, among other things, the Fourth Extension. In connection with the vote to approve the Fourth Extension, Public Stockholders holding 753 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately $9,266 (approximately $12.31 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders, leaving approximately $760,000 in the Trust Account.There were no repurchases of our equity securities by us or an affiliate during the fiscalÂ year covered by the Report.ItemÂ 6. [Reserved]âItemÂ 7. Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Cautionary NoteÂ Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements under this item regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report, words such as âanticipate,â âbelieve,â âestimate,â âexpect,â âintendâ and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph.The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report.OverviewWe are a blank-check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on AprilÂ 13, 2021, for the purposes of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry.Recent DevelopmentsExtension of our Combination PeriodWe initially had up to 12Â monthsÂ from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (until FebruaryÂ 15, 2023) to complete a Business Combination, except that the Sponsor had two 3-monthÂ extensions available to it, for a total of up to 18Â months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (until AugustÂ 15, 2023) to complete the initial Business Combination. We currently have until FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 to consummate an initial Business Combination (subject to further extension with the approval of stockholders pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Charter, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules).21
Table of ContentsWe have extended our time to complete a business combination four times, with our stockholders having the ability to redeem each time. Following such redemptions, there are currently 62,488 Public Shares outstanding and a total of 4,309,988 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common stock outstanding.Instinct Brothers Co., Ltd Business CombinationOn FebruaryÂ 28, 2025, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the âBusiness Combination Agreementâ) by and among (i)Â Relativity Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (together with its successors, the âPurchaserâ), (ii)Â Relativity HoldingsÂ Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (âPubcoâ), (iii)Â Relativity Purchaser Merger Sub IIÂ Inc., a company to be formed in the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco (the âMerger Subâ and the Merger Sub, collectively with the Purchaser and Pubco, the âPurchaser Partiesâ), (iv)Â Instinct Brothers Co., Ltd, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (an âOperating Companyâ and âTarget Companyâ) and its shareholder named on Annex I hereto ( âSellerâ), (vi)Â Tomoki Nagano (âFounderâ), (vii)Â Relativity Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative for the stockholders of Pubco (other than the Seller) (the âPurchaser Representativeâ), and (viii)Â Tomoki Nagano in the capacity as the representative for the Seller (the âSeller Representativeâ). The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to herein as the âTransaction.âPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (a)Â the Merger Sub will merge with and into Relativity, with Relativity surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and (b)Â each Seller shall contribute all of its ownership interests in each Operating Company to Pubco in exchange for aggregate consideration in the amount of $200,000,000 (the âContribution Considerationâ), to be paid in the common stock of Pubco valued at $10.00 per share of common stock. At the Closing, each public warrant of Relativity shall be converted into one Pubco public warrant and each private warrant of Relativity shall be converted into one Pubco private warrant, in each case with such Pubco warrant having substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the respective Relativity warrants, except that in each case they shall represent the right to acquire shares of Pubco common stock in lieu of shares of Relativity ClassÂ A common stock.The obligations of the parties to complete the Closing are subject to various conditions. We are working toward completing the proposed business combination as soon as possible.Results of OperationsAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from AprilÂ 13, 2021 (inception) through DecemberÂ 31, 2024, relates to our formation and initial public offering and identifying a target company for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. We generated non-operatingÂ income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the initial public offering and placed in the trust account.For theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024, we had net loss of $440,564, which consists of general and administrative costs of $741,798, provision for income taxes of $81,983 and a change in the fair value of warrant liability of $15,780 offset by gain from extinguishment of promissory note of $ 360,114 and income from investments held in the trust account of $38,883.For theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023, we had net loss of $2,305,489, which consists of a change in the fair value of warrant liability of $72,885, provision for income taxes of $13,333 and general and administrative costs of $2,300,807, offset by income from investments held in the trust account of $81,536.Factors That MayÂ Adversely Affect Our Results of OperationsOur results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, including resurgences and the emergence of new virus variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination.22
Table of ContentsLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going ConcernAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company had $1,674 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $2,090,343.On FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 14,375,000 Units, including 1,875,000 Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwritersâ over-allotment option in full, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $143,750,000.Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 653,750 Private Placement Units in the Private Placement to our Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $6,537,500.Transaction costs amounted to $3,890,326, consisting of $1,437,500 of underwriting commissions, $1,972,398 of the excess of the fair value of ClassÂ B Common Stock issued to the Initial Public Offering underwriter over the share subscription receivable and $480,428 of other offering costs.Following the closing of our Initial Public Offering, $146,625,000.00 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units in the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account maintained by Continental, as trustee. In connection with our 2022 Special Meeting held on DecemberÂ 21, 2022, stockholders holding 14,221,705 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in our Trust Account. As a result, approximately $146 million (approximately $10.29 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2022, approximately $1,671,810 remained in the Trust Account. On FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2024 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2025 (the âCombination Periodâ). In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, stockholders holding 90,054 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $1.02 million (approximately $11.32 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $720,000 will remain in the Trust Account. Following the redemptions, the Company had 63,241 Public Shares outstanding. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately $1,746,543 and $1,671,810 remained in the trust account.In connection with the redemptions of Public Shares, a total of approximately $25,000 was deducted from our Trust Account in order to pay taxes prior to the 2024 Special Meeting.We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes and liquidation expenses if we are unsuccessful in completing a Business Combination. We may pay our franchise taxes from funds from the Initial Public Offering held outside of the Trust Account or from interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account reduced by our operating expense and franchise taxes. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the Trust Account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.Further, our Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required for Working Capital Loans. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into Units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. At DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.On AugustÂ 10, 2023, we issued the SVES Promissory NoteÂ to SVES LLC under which SVES LLC agreed to extend us $300,000Â for working capital purposes. The SVES Promissory NoteÂ is non-interestÂ bearing and payable on the closing of the SVES Business Combination.Â In the event the SVES Business Combination is not consummated, the SVES Promissory NoteÂ shall be null and void and we shall not have any obligation to the payee. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, SVES LLC had funded $15,600 on the promissory note and had $284,400 available for withdrawal. Due to the termination of the SVES Business Combination, on MayÂ 15, 2024, the SVES Promissory NoteÂ is null and void.23
Table of ContentsOn JulyÂ 15, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note (âMazaii Noteâ) with Mazaii CorpÂ Ltd. pursuant to which Mazaii agreed to loan the Company an aggregate principal amount of up to $250,000. The Mazaii note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination. In the event a Business Combination Agreement is not consummated, the Mazaii note shall be null and void and the Company shall not have any obligation to the Payee hereunder. The exclusivity period of the LOI expired on SeptemberÂ 12, 2024 by which time both parties had chosen to not proceed. As a result, the Mazaii NoteÂ became null and void.The Company will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.Further, we have determined that if we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, then we will (i)Â cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten businessÂ days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash and (iii)Â as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as our working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after the applicable extension date.We pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 perÂ month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support, pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement. Upon completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying theseÂ monthly fees. For theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred and paid $120,000 and $105,000 of administrative service fees.Pursuant to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement, we engaged A.G.P. as an advisor in connection with the Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target businessâ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with the initial Business Combination, and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. We will pay A.G.P. a fee in cash for such services upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination in an amount equal toÂ 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $5,031,250Â in the aggregate; however, no fee will be due if we do not complete an initial Business Combination.In connection with the Companyâs assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, âPresentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern,â the Company has until FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 (absent any extensions of such period, pursuant to the terms described above) to consummate the proposed Business Combination. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate the proposed Business Combination by this date. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, unless that time is extended (as provided above, or pursuant to a stockholder vote), there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate by FebruaryÂ 15, 2026. The Company intends to complete the proposed Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period.Subsequent EventsAppointment of DirectorsOn FebruaryÂ 1, 2025 the Company appointed David Kane as a Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, and Jessica Assaf as a Director and Chair of the Compensation Committee.24
Table of ContentsOn FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the â2025 Meetingâ). At the 2025 Meeting, the Companyâs stockholders approved an amendment to the Companyâs fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the âCharter Amendmentâ) to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2025 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 or such earlier date as determined by the Companyâs board of directors. The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on FebruaryÂ 17, 2025.In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, stockholders holding 753 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $7,530 (approximately $11.96 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $760,000 remained in the Trust Account.On FebruaryÂ 28, 2025, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the âBusiness Combination Agreementâ) by and among (i)Â the Company (together with its successors, the âPurchaserâ), (ii)Â Relativity HoldingsÂ Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (âPubcoâ), (iii)Â Relativity Purchaser Merger Sub IIÂ Inc., a company to be formed in the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco (the âMerger Subâ and the Merger Sub, collectively with the Purchaser and Pubco, the âPurchaser Partiesâ), (iv)Â Instinct Brothers Co., Ltd, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan (an âOperating Companyâ and âTarget Companyâ) and its shareholder ( âSellerâ), (vi)Â Tomoki Nagano (âFounderâ), (vii)Â Relativity Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time (as defined below) for the stockholders of Pubco (other than the Seller) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the âPurchaser Representativeâ), and (viii)Â Tomoki Nagano in the capacity as the representative from and after the date hereof for the Seller in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the âSeller Representativeâ).Promissory NoteOn JanuaryÂ 24, 2025, the Company entered into a promissory note (âInstinct Noteâ) with Instinct Bio Technical Company PteÂ Ltd. (âInstinctâ) pursuant to which Instinct agreed to loan the Company an aggregate principal amount of up to $400,000. The Instinct NoteÂ is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination. In the event a Business Combination Agreement is not consummated, the Instinct NoteÂ shall be null and void and the Company shall not have any obligation to Instinct hereunder. As of the date of the issuance of this Quarterly Report, $175,000 has been funded to the Company.Emerging Growth Company StatusWe are an âemerging growth company,â as defined in SectionÂ 2(a)Â of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of SectionÂ 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.Further, SectionÂ 102(b)(1)Â of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we as an emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.Critical Accounting EstimatesThis Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.25
Table of ContentsMaking estimates requires Management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which Management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We determined the more significant accounting estimates included in our financial statements is the determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments.Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, âDerivatives and Hedgingâ. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, such as our Warrants, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations contained elsewhere in this Report. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12Â months of the balance sheet date.The valuation of our Public Warrants is based on a traded market. Our Private Placement Warrants are valued using a Monte Carlo options pricing model which utilizes assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. We estimate the volatility of our Common Stock based on projected volatility of comparable public companies that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the Warrants is based on Management assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of completing a Business Combination. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which we anticipate to remain at zero.The estimates used to calculate the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities change at each balance sheet date based on our stock price and other assumptions described above. If our assumptions change or we experience significant volatility in our stock price or interest rates, the fair value calculated from one balance sheet period to the next could be materially different.Recent Accounting StandardsIn DecemberÂ 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.Â 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (âASU 2023-09â), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for Annual periods beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2024. The Company is still reviewing the impact of ASU 2023-09.In NovemberÂ 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 âSegment ReportingÂ (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosuresâ which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 has not had a material impact on the Companyâs financial statements and disclosures.In AugustÂ 2020, Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2020-06, âDebtÂ â Debt with Conversion and Other Optionsâ (Subtopic 470-20), and âDerivatives and HedgingÂ â Contracts in Entityâs Own Equityâ (Subtopic 815-40) (âASU 2020-06â) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entityâs own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entityâs own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscalÂ years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2020-06 effective as of AprilÂ 13, 2021. That adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.26
Table of ContentsIn JuneÂ 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.Â 2016-13, âFinancial InstrumentsÂ - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrumentsâ (âASU 2016-13â). This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Since JuneÂ 2016, the FASB issued clarifying updates to the new standard including changing the effective date for smaller reporting companies. The guidance is effective for fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscalÂ years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on JanuaryÂ 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.ItemÂ 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.We are a smaller reporting company as defined by RuleÂ 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item.ItemÂ 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Reference is made to pagesÂ F-1 through F-25 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.ItemÂ 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.None.ItemÂ 9A. Controls and Procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rulesÂ and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the âCertifying Officersâ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in RulesÂ 13a-15(e)Â and 15d-15(e)Â under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not operating effectively as of the end of the period covered by this report due to a failure to timely close our books and records for each fiscal period and our failure to timely file of regulatory filings.We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.27
Table of ContentsManagementâs Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial ReportingAs required by SEC rulesÂ and regulations implementing SectionÂ 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:(1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our Company,(2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our Management and directors, and(3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024. In making these assessments, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlÂ â Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, Management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 due to a material weakness for the failure to timely close our books and records for each fiscal period and our failure to timely file of regulatory filings.We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.This Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.ItemÂ 9B.

Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial Business Combination, the Compensation Committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial Business Combination.The Compensation Committee charter also provides that the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the Compensation Committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.After our initial Business Combination, members of Management who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders, such as on a FormÂ S-4 Registration Statement. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the stockholder meeting held to consider an initial Business Combination, as it is up to the directors of the post-combinationÂ business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on FormÂ 8-KÂ or a periodic report, as required by the SEC.33
Table of ContentsNominating and Corporate Governance CommitteeWe have established the Nominating Committee. Francis KnuettelÂ II serve as members of the Nominating Committee. Mr.Â Knuettel is independent, and Mr.Â Knuettel chairs the Nominating Committee. We have adopted the Nominating Committee charter, which details the principal functions of the Nominating Committee, including recommending to the Board candidates for nomination for election at the annual meetings of the stockholders, such as the 2023 Annual Meeting. Prior to our initial Business Combination, the Board will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by holders of our Founder Shares during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at an annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our Nominating Committee also considers director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders in accordance with the Nominating Committee charter and the Bylaws. Candidates are reviewed in the context of the then current composition of the Board, our operating requirements of and the long-termÂ interests of our stockholders.We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Board considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders.Code of EthicsWe have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed copies of our form of the Code of Conduct and Ethics and the charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee as exhibits to the Report, and copies are posted on our website: www.relativityacquisitions.com. Our stockholders can also review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SECâs website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Conduct and Ethics and the charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee will be provided without charge upon request from us. If we make any amendments to our Code of Conduct and Ethics other than technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code of Conduct and Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions requiring disclosure under applicable SEC or Nasdaq rules, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website. The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.Trading PoliciesOn FebruaryÂ 10, 2022, we adopted insider trading policies and procedures governing the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of our securities by directors, officers and employees, which are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rulesÂ and regulations, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards (the âInsider Trading Policyâ).ItemÂ 11. Executive Compensation.Other than disclosed herein, none of our officers has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 perÂ month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support, pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement. Upon completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying theseÂ monthly fees. No compensation of any kind, including any finderâs fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to the Sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of the Sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocketÂ expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our Audit Committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial Business Combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. Other than quarterly Audit Committee review of such payments, we have not had and do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocketÂ expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial Business Combination.34
Table of ContentsAfter the completion of our initial Business Combination, directors or members of Management who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial Business Combination, such as on a FormÂ S-4 Registration Statement. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of Management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial Business Combination, because the directors of the post-combinationÂ business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the Board for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on the Board.We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of Management maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial Business Combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial Business Combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence Managementâs motivation in identifying or selecting a target business, but we do not believe that the ability of Management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial Business Combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential Business Combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.ItemÂ 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of MarchÂ XX, 2025 based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock, by:âeach person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock;âeach of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our Common Stock; andâall our executive officers and directors as a group.In the table below,Â percentage ownership is based on 4,310,741 shares of our Common Stock, consisting of (i)Â 4,310,740 shares of our ClassÂ A Common Stock and (ii)Â one share of our ClassÂ B Common Stock issued and outstanding as of MarchÂ XX, 2025.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.On MayÂ 28, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 3,750,000Â Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On DecemberÂ 14, 2021, the Sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 511,250 Founder Shares, which we cancelled, resulting in an aggregate of 3,238,750 Founder Shares outstanding and held by the Sponsor. On DecemberÂ 14, 2021, we issued 355,000 Founder Shares to A.G.P. On JanuaryÂ 12, 2022, the Sponsor transferred 176,094 Founder Shares to George Syllantavos, and 28,750 Founder Shares to Anastasios Chrysostomidis. The total number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of the Initial Public Offering (not including the Private Placement Shares). The Founder Shares (including the ClassÂ A Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.The Sponsor purchased 653,750 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $6,537,500. The Private Placement UnitsÂ are identical to the UnitsÂ sold in the Initial Public Offering except that (a)Â the Private Placement UnitsÂ and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30Â days after the consummation of our initial Business Combination except to permitted transferees, (b)Â the Private Placement Shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock included in the Private Placement UnitsÂ and underlying the Private Placement Warrants will be entitled to registration rights and (c)Â the Private Placement Warrants are entitled to registration rights.On FebruaryÂ 27, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 3,593,749Â shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock to our Sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of the Founder Shares, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of ClassÂ B Common Stock in the Founder Share Conversion. These shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the ClassÂ B Common Stock before the Founder Share Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Registration Statement. Following the Founder Share Conversion, our Sponsor was the beneficial owner of 3,033,905 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common Stock. The Sponsor then transferred 533,525 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock to certain members of the Sponsor. Subsequent to those transfers and the Founder Sharer Conversion, the Sponsor currently holds 2,500,380 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common Stock, as well as 653,750Â shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock that are part of Private Placement Units that were acquired by the Sponsor in the Private Placement.36
Table of ContentsIf any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-currentÂ fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.We pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 perÂ month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support, pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement. Upon completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying theseÂ monthly fees. For theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred and paid $120,000 and $105,000 of administrative service fees.Other than the foregoing, no compensation of any kind, including any finderâs fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to the Sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of the Sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocketÂ expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our Audit Committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and determines which expenses and the amount of expenses that are reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocketÂ expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.Prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO under the IPO Promissory Note. This loan was non-interestÂ bearing, unsecured and was due at the earlier of MarchÂ 31, 2022 or the closing of the IPO.Â The outstanding balance under the IPO Promissory NoteÂ of $208,563Â was paid in full and as a result, the credit facility is no longer available.On AugustÂ 10, 2023, we issued the SVES Promissory NoteÂ to SVES LLC under which SVES LLC agreed to extend us $300,000Â for working capital purposes. The SVES Promissory NoteÂ is non-interestÂ bearing and payable on the closing of the SVES Business Combination.Â In the event the SVES Business Combination is not consummated, the SVES Promissory NoteÂ shall be null and void and we shall not have any obligation to the payee. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, SVES LLC funded approximately $15,600 under the SVES Promissory NoteÂ and had $284,400 available for withdrawal. On MayÂ 14, 2024, the Company terminated the SVES Business Combination and as part of that termination the SVES Promissory NoteÂ is null and void.In connection with the Second Extension, we issued the Second Extension Promissory NoteÂ in the aggregate principal amount of up to $42,498 to SVES LLC, pursuant to which SVES LLC agreed to loan us up to $42,498. Under the terms of the Second Extension Promissory Note, SVES LLC (or its affiliates or permitted designees) shall deposit $3,541.50 perÂ month (approximately $0.056 per Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the vote to approve the Second Extension) into the Trust Account for each calendarÂ month (commencing on FebruaryÂ 15, 2024 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequentÂ month) until FebruaryÂ 15, 2025, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete a Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of $42,498. The Second Extension Promissory NoteÂ bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the date of the consummation of the SVES Business Combination. On MayÂ 15, 2024, the Company terminated the SVES Business Combination and as part of that termination the Second Extension Promissory NoteÂ is null and void.In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required. If we complete an initial Business Combination, we would repay such Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalentÂ units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 150,000Â units if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted), at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms of such Working Capital Loans (or extension loans) by the Sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. At DecemberÂ 31, 2023 and 2022, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.37

We will pay A.G.P. a fee in cash for such services upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination in an amount equal toÂ 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $5,031,250Â in the aggregate; however, no fee will be due if we do not complete an initial Business Combination engaged A.G.P. as an advisor in connection with the Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target businessâ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with the initial Business Combination, and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination.

An âindependent directorâ is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the companyâs board of directors, would interfere with the directorâs exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board has determined that Emily Paxhia and Francis KnuettelÂ II are âindependent directorsâ as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.ItemÂ 14.

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors ofRelativity Acquisition Corp.Opinion on the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Relativity Acquisition Corp. and its Subsidiary (the âCompanyâ) as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholdersâ deficit and cash flows for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the âconsolidated financial statementsâ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Going ConcernThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in NoteÂ 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business combination by FebruaryÂ 15, 2026, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. Managementâs plans in regard to these matters are also described in NoteÂ 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companyâs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (âPCAOBâ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rulesÂ and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

RELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024NoteÂ 1Â âÂ Organization and Business OperationsRelativity Acquisition Corp. (the âRelativityâ or the âCompanyâ) is a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on AprilÂ 13, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the âBusiness Combinationâ). The Company may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any business or industry.As of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from AprilÂ 13, 2021 (inception) through DecemberÂ 31, 2024 relates to the Companyâs formation and the initial public offering (âIPOâ), described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operatingÂ income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the IPO.The Company has selected DecemberÂ 31 as its fiscalÂ year end.The sponsor is Relativity Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the âSponsorâ).The registration statement for the Companyâs IPO was declared effective on FebruaryÂ 10, 2022 (the âEffective Dateâ). On FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO ofÂ 14,375,000Â units at $10.00Â per unit (the âUnitsâ), including the issuance ofÂ 1,875,000Â units as a result of the full exercise of the underwritersâ over-allotment option, which is discussed in NoteÂ 3. Each Unit consists of one share of ClassÂ A common stock and one redeemable warrant (âPublic Warrantâ). Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Companyâs ClassÂ A common stock at a price of $11.50Â per share.Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, includingÂ 1,875,000Â Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwritersâ option to purchase additional units to cover over-allotments, the Company consummated the private placement ofÂ 653,750Â units (the âPrivate Placement Unitsâ) to the Sponsor, at a price of $10.00Â per Private Placement Unit in a private placement. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of ClassÂ A common stock and one warrant (âPrivate Placement Warrantâ).Transaction costs amounted to $3,890,326,Â consisting of $1,437,500Â of underwriting commissions, $1,972,398Â of the excess of the fair value of ClassÂ B common stock issued to underwriters over the share subscription receivable and $480,428Â of other offering costs.The Companyâs management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination.The initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at leastÂ 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of the business combination fee held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the Companyâs signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete an initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquiresÂ 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company ActÂ ofÂ 1940, as amended (the âInvestment Company Actâ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.F-7
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024Following the closing of the IPO and full exercise of the over-allotment by the underwriters on FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, $146,625,000 ($10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units was deposited into a trust account (the âTrust Accountâ) and will be invested only in U.S.Â government securities with a maturity of 185Â days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under RuleÂ 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.Â government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay the Companyâs franchise and income tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), the net proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement UnitsÂ will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (a)Â the completion of the initial Business Combination, (b)Â the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Companyâs amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i)Â to modify the substance or timing of the Companyâs obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii)Â with respect to any other provision relating to stockholdersâ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, and (c)Â the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Companyâs creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the public stockholders.The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i)Â in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii)Â without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in the Companyâs discretion.The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of twoÂ businessÂ days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Companyâs franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account initially was $10.20Â per public share. The per-share amount the Company will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the business combination fee the Company will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of the initial Business Combination with respect to the Companyâs warrants.The shares of common stock subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) Accounting Standards Codification (âASCâ) TopicÂ 480, âDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity.â In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Companyâs ClassÂ A common stock is not a âpenny stockâ upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.F-8
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024The Company had 12Â months from the closing of the IPO to complete the initial Business Combination, except that the Sponsor had two 3-month extensions available to it for a total of up to 18Â months to complete the initial Business Combination (as set out below). On DecemberÂ 21, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the âMeetingâ) in which the stockholders approved an amendment to the Companyâs second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2023 to AugustÂ 15, 2023, by which is was required to pay $10,000 in the Trust Account. The Sponsor was permitted to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination for up to two times without stockholder approval, each for an additional threeÂ months (for a total of up to 24Â months to complete a Business Combination (each such three-month period, a âFunded Extension Periodâ)), so long as the Company deposited an aggregate amount of $1,000 from its working capital into the trust account no later than the 21-month and 24-month anniversary of its IPO for each such extension that the Company determines to implement. The public stockholders were not entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any Funded Extension Periods. On AugustÂ 7, 2023, the Company announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from AugustÂ 15, 2023 to NovemberÂ 15, 2023, which is the first of two Funded Extension Periods. On NovemberÂ 9, 2023, the Company announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from NovemberÂ 15, 2023 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2024. In accordance with the Sponsorâs request and with the Companyâs current charter, an aggregate amount of $1,000 from Relativityâs working capital was deposited into the Trust Account on AugustÂ 3, 2023 and NovemberÂ 9, 2023, respectively. On NovemberÂ 9, 2023, Relativity announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from NovemberÂ 15, 2023 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2024.On FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2024 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2025 (the âCombination Periodâ). In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, stockholders holding 90,054 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $1.02 million (approximately $11.32 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $720,000 remained in the Trust Account. Following the redemptions, the Company had 63,241 Public Shares outstanding.In connection with the stockholdersâ vote at the Meeting on DecemberÂ 21, 2022,Â 14,221,705Â shares were submitted for redemption. In connection with the redemptions of public shares, a total of $133,689 was withdrawn from the Companyâs trust account in order to pay taxes prior to the Special Meeting, which amount had later been determined to be withheld in excess and should be returned to the public stockholders. As such, a portion of this rebate was sent to the financial institutions that had submitted share redemptions on behalf of their investor clients ahead of the Special Meeting and the balance to the trust account. The redemption rebate payments total $132,263 ($0.00930008 per redeemed share), with $1,426 returned to the trust account. In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, stockholders holding 90,054 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $1.02 million (approximately $11.32 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $720,000 will remain in the Trust Account. Following the redemptions, the Company had 63,241 Public Shares outstanding.On FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the â2025 Meetingâ). At the 2025 Meeting, the Companyâs stockholders approved an amendment to the Companyâs fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation (theÂ â2025 Charter Amendmentâ) to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2025 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 or such earlier date as determined by the Companyâs the Board. The Company filed the 2025 Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.In connection with the 2025 Meeting, stockholders holding 753 shares of ClassÂ A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $7,530 (approximately $11.96 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has 3,362,605 ClassÂ A common stock outstanding.As a result of stockholder approval of the 2025 Charter Amendment and the Companyâs implementation thereof, an aggregate amount of $1,000 perÂ month, from the Sponsor or its designees as extension contribution shall be deposited in the Trust Account seven calendarÂ days before FebruaryÂ 28, 2025.F-9

In addition, the Letter stated that the Company did not comply with either of the alternative requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market under Listing RulesÂ 5450(b)(1)Â or 5450(b)(3), or the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Listing RuleÂ 5550. The Letter also indicated that the Staff had concerns that the Company might no longer comply with the minimum 400 Total Holders requirement of Listing RuleÂ 5450(a)(2)Â due to the substantial number of stockholder redemptions and low number of shares remaining outstanding. Additionally, the Letter indicated that, while companies are normally afforded compliance periods or the ability to submit a plan of compliance in order to be granted time to regain compliance, the Staff had determined to apply a more stringent criteria as permitted under Nasdaq Listing RuleÂ 5101 to delist the Companyâs securities from The Nasdaq Global Market. As a result, the Letter indicated that the Staff had determined to delist the Companyâs securities from The Nasdaq Global Market. The Staffâs determination was based on the Companyâs Current Report on FormÂ 8-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) on DecemberÂ 28, 2022, in which the Company disclosed that holders of 14,221,705 shares of ClassÂ A common stock exercised their redemption rights in connection with a special meeting of stockholders held on DecemberÂ 21, 2022.In addition, on JanuaryÂ 11, 2023, the Staff determined to halt trading in the Companyâs securities (the âTrading Haltâ). The Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the âPanelâ) to appeal the Staffâs delisting determination. A hearing request stays any suspension or delisting of the Companyâs securities, and the Companyâs securities continued to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Market until the hearing process concluded and the Panel issued a written decision following the hearing. At this juncture, the Company is unable to provide assurance as to if and when the trading halt will be released.F-10
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024On MarchÂ 2, 2023, Relativity had a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Staffâs delisting determination. After the hearing, the Panel requested additional information from Relativity, which was provided on AprilÂ 12, 2023. On AprilÂ 20, 2023, the Panel granted Relativityâs request to continue the listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, the Panel did not remove the Trading Halt. On JuneÂ 3, 2024, Nasdaq filed a form 25-NSE removing and delisting the Companyâs securities from Nasdaq and SectionÂ 12b of the Securities and Exchange Act.On MarchÂ 27, 2024, Mr.Â John Anthony Quelch resigned from the Company. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company or any matter relating to the Companyâs operations, policies or practices.On JulyÂ 11, 2024, the Company announced that it entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (âLOIâ) providing for a proposed business combination (the âTransactionâ) that will result in the Company acquiring 100% of the outstanding equity and equity equivalents of 4503309 Nova ScotiaÂ Ltd., (to be renamed âMazaii CorpÂ Ltd.â) (âMazaiiâ). The exclusivity period of the LOI expired on SeptemberÂ 12, 2024 by which time both parties had chosen to not proceed.Risks and UncertaintiesResults of operations and the Companyâs ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond its control. The business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, inflation, increases in interest rates, adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in the Ukraine. The Company cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact the Companyâs business and its ability to complete an initial Business Combination. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.Consideration of IR Act Excise TaxOn AugustÂ 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the âIR Actâ) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after JanuaryÂ 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxableÂ year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the âTreasuryâ) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after DecemberÂ 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i)Â the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii)Â the structure of a Business Combination, (iii)Â the nature and amount of any âPIPEâ or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxableÂ year of a Business Combination) and (iv)Â the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Companyâs ability to complete a Business Combination.F-11
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024On FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, the Companyâs stockholders redeemed 90,054 public shares of common stock, for a total redemption amount of $1,019,230. The Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the stock redemption under ASC 450, âContingenciesâ. ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists, the likelihood that the future event(s)Â will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status of completing an initial business combination as well as variability of its liquidation date as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and concluded that it is probable that a contingent liability should be recorded. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company recorded $10,192 of excise tax liability calculated as 1% of shares redeemed on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024.Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going ConcernAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company hadÂ $1,674 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $2,090,343.The Company will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating the business. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Companyâs officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the âWorking Capital Loansâ). If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 150,000 units if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted) at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms of such working capital loans by the Sponsor or its affiliates, or the Companyâs officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to the Working Capital Loans. The Company does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor as the Company does not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in the Trust Account. At DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.In connection with the Companyâs assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, âPresentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern,â the Company has until FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 (absent any extensions of such period, pursuant to the terms described above) to consummate the proposed Business Combination. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate the proposed Business Combination by this date. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, unless that time is extended (as provided above, or pursuant to a stockholder vote), there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate by FebruaryÂ 15, 2026. The Company intends to complete the proposed Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period.NoteÂ 2Â - Restatement of Previously Issued Financial StatementsManagement determined it should restate its previously reported consolidated financial statements for theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024. The Company identified that the presentation of the cash withdrawn from the Trust Account as an investing cash outflow and the cash used to redeem stock as a financing cash inflow was made in error in the Companyâs consolidated statements of cash flows for theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024. In accordance with ASC 230-10-45 the correct presentation should reflect cash withdrawn from the Trust Account as an investing cash inflow, as it represents a release of funds previously classified as investing assets and cash used to redeem ClassÂ A ordinary shares as a financing cash outflow, as it reflects a return of capital to shareholders and a reduction of the Companyâs equity.F-12
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024The impact of the restatement on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements is reflected in the following table:âââââââââÂ Â Â Â As Â Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â AsConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2024Â Â Â Â ReportedÂ Â Â Â AdjustmentÂ Â Â Â RestatedCash withdrawn from Trust Account in connection with redemptionsâ (1,019,230)â 2,038,460â 1,019,230Net cash provided by (used in) investing activitiesÂ  (1,022,301)Â  2,038,460Â  1,016,159Redemption of ordinary sharesÂ  1,019,230Â  (2,038,460)Â  (1,019,230)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activitiesÂ  1,363,744Â  (2,038,460)Â  (674,716)ââNoteÂ 3Â â Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âU.S. GAAPâ) and pursuant to the rulesÂ and regulations of the SEC.Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Relativity HoldingsÂ Inc. There has been no intercompany activity since inception.Emerging Growth Company StatusThe Company is an âemerging growth company,â as defined in SectionÂ 2 (a)Â of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups ActÂ ofÂ 2012 (the âJOBS Actâ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of SectionÂ 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.Further, SectionÂ 102(b)(1)Â of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the ExchangeÂ Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emergingÂ growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companyâs financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.F-13
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company has determined the more significant accounting estimates included in the consolidated financial statements is the determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments as described below.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of threeÂ months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had cash of $1,674 and $7,131, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023.Cash and Investments Held in Trust AccountAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company held $769,267 in cash in its Trust Account. Additionally, as of DecemberÂ 31, 2023, the Company had $1,746,543 in investments within the Trust Account, primarily consisting of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units were placed in the Trust Account which invested in United States âgovernment securitiesâ within the meaning of SectionÂ 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185Â days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under RuleÂ 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The Companyâs investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of warrant liability are included in interest income on investments held in Trust Account in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe fair value of the Companyâs assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC Topic 820, âFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,â approximates the carrying amounts represented in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily due to its short-term nature (except for the warrant liabilitiesÂ â see NoteÂ 8).Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The Companyâs financial instruments are classified as either Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3. These tiers include:âLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;âLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; andâLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.F-14
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC TopicÂ 815, âDerivatives and Hedgingâ. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12Â months of the consolidated balance sheet date.Net Loss per Common StockThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as ClassÂ A common stock and ClassÂ B common stock. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. The 15,028,750 shares of ClassÂ A common stock from the outstanding warrants to purchase the Companyâs shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share for theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 because the warrants are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. As a result, basic and diluted net loss per ClassÂ A share is the same for the periods presented. The table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share for each class of common stock.At DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company did not have any other dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted and basic loss per ClassÂ B share is the same for the period.The following tables present a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share for each class of common stock.âââââââââFor the Year EndedââDecember 31,âÂ Â Â 2024Â Â Â 2023Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemptionÂ âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Numerator: Net loss allocable to Class A common stockâ$ (7,554)â$ (80,308)Denominator: Weighted Average Class A common stockâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstandingâÂ  74,097âÂ  153,295Basic and diluted net loss per shareâ$ (0.10)â$ (0.52)âââââââClass A Common Stock non-redeemableâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Numerator: Net loss allocable to Class A common stockâ$ (433,010)â$ (1,930,363)Denominator: Weighted Average Class A common stockâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstandingâÂ  4,247,499âÂ  3,684,742Basic and diluted net loss per shareâ$ (0.10)â$ (0.52)âââââââClass B Common StockâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Numerator: Net (loss) income allocable to Class B common stockâ$ ââ$ (294,818)Denominator: Weighted Average Class B common stockâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstandingâÂ  1âÂ  562,758Basic net loss per shareâ$ (0.10)â$ (0.52)âF-15
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, âIncome Taxesâ (âASC 740â). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the Companyâs deferred tax asset had a full valuation allowance recorded against it. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, due to changes in fair value in warrant liability and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterpriseâs financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.Common Stock Subject to Possible RedemptionThe Companyâs ClassÂ A common stock that was sold as part of the Units in the IPO contains a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Companyâs liquidation, or if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Companyâs initial Business Combination. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classified the 14,375,000 shares subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The public shares sold as part of the Units in the IPO were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., Public Warrants), and as such, the initial carrying value of public shares is classified as temporary equity.On DecemberÂ 21, 2022, the Company held the Meeting to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2023 to AugustÂ 15, 2023 or such earlier date as determined by the Companyâs Board of Directors, and to provide for up to two additional three-month extensions beyond AugustÂ 15, 2023 for the period of time for the Company to consummate an initial Business Combination. In connection with the Meeting, stockholders holding 14,221,705 shares of ClassÂ A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $146 million (approximately $10.29 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $1.6 million remained in the Trust Account. In MarchÂ 2023, the Company assessed and determined that an excess amount was withdrawn from the trust account for taxes in connection with the DecemberÂ 2022 redemptions. As such, in MarchÂ 2023, the Company had a subsequent disbursement to redeeming stockholders in the amount of $132,263.On FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had extended the date by which it has to consummate a Business Combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2024 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2025. In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2024, stockholders holding 90,054 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $1.02 million (approximately $11.32 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $720,000 remained in the Trust Account. Following the redemptions, the Company had 63,241 Public Shares outstanding.Following redemptions, the Company has 153,295 Public Shares outstanding as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.On FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the â2025 Meetingâ). At the 2025 Meeting, the Companyâs stockholders approved an amendment to the Companyâs fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the âCharter Amendmentâ) to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from FebruaryÂ 15, 2025 to FebruaryÂ 15, 2026 or such earlier date as determined by the Companyâs board of directors. The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on FebruaryÂ 17, 2025.F-16
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024In connection with the extension on FebruaryÂ 13, 2025, stockholders holding 753 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Companyâs Trust Account. As a result, approximately $7,530 (approximately $11.96 per Public Share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $760,000 remained in the Trust Account.Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company had cash balances at financial institutions which throughout theÂ year did not exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Companyâs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Recent Accounting StandardsIn DecemberÂ 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) No.Â 2023-09, âIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosuresâ (âASU 2023-09â), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for Annual periods beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2024. The Company is still reviewing the impact of ASU 2023-09.In NovemberÂ 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 âSegment ReportingÂ (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosuresâ which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on JanuaryÂ 1, 2024. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the accompanying financial statements.In AugustÂ 2020, FASB issued ASU No.Â 2020-06, âDebtÂ â Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and HedgingÂ â Contracts in Entityâs Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)â (âASU 2020-06â), to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entityâs own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entityâs own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscalÂ years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective as of AprilÂ 13, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements.In JuneÂ 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.Â 2016-13, âFinancial InstrumentsÂ - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrumentsâ (âASU 2016-13â). This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Since JuneÂ 2016, the FASB issued clarifying updates to the new standard including changing the effective date for smaller reporting companies. The guidance is effective for fiscalÂ years beginning after DecemberÂ 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscalÂ years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on JanuaryÂ 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companyâs consolidated financial statements.F-17
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024NoteÂ 4Â âÂ Initial Public OfferingOn FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, the Company consummated its IPO ofÂ 14,375,000Â Units, includingÂ 1,875,000Â Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwritersâ option to purchase additional units to cover over-allotments, at a purchase price of $10.00Â per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of ClassÂ A common stock and one redeemable Public Warrant.Â Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of ClassÂ A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see NoteÂ 6).Following the closing of the IPO on FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, $146,625,000Â ($10.20Â per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in a Trust Account and will be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185Â days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under RuleÂ 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.All of theÂ 14,375,000Â shares of ClassÂ A common stock sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Companyâs liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Companyâs certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC TopicÂ 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity.Accordingly, at DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, 63,241 and 153,295 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively, are presented at redemption value of $11.74 and $11.45 per share, as temporary equity, outside of the stockholdersâ deficit section of the Companyâs consolidated balance sheets, respectively.The shares of ClassÂ A common stock are accounted for in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period.The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable common stock resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.As of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the common stock subject to possible redemption reflected on the consolidated balance sheets is reconciled in the following table:ââââCommon stock subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2022Â Â Â Â $ 1,805,814Less:Â âÂ Â RedemptionsÂ â (132,263)Plus:Â âÂ Â Remeasurement of carrying value to redemption valueÂ â 50,350Common stock subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2023Â â 1,723,901Less:Â âÂ Â RedemptionsÂ â (1,019,230)Plus:Â âÂ Â Remeasurement of carrying value to redemption valueÂ â (25,599)Common stock subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2024â$ 679,072ââF-18
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024NoteÂ 5Â âÂ Private PlacementSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Companyâs Sponsor purchased an aggregate ofÂ 653,750Â Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00Â per Unit, or $6,537,500Â in the aggregate, in a private placement.Â Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of ClassÂ A common stock and one Private Placement Warrant.The Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in the IPO.NoteÂ 6Â âÂ Related Party TransactionsFounder SharesIn MayÂ 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000Â of deferred offering costs on behalf of the Company in exchange forÂ 3,750,000Â shares of common stock (the âFounder Sharesâ). On DecemberÂ 14, 2021, the Sponsor returned to the Company, at no cost, an aggregate ofÂ 511,250Â Founder Shares, which the Company cancelled. On DecemberÂ 14, 2021, an aggregate ofÂ 355,000Â shares of ClassÂ B common stock were issued to A.G.P. (the âRepresentativeâ), resulting in an aggregate ofÂ 3,593,750Â shares of ClassÂ B common stock outstanding. On JanuaryÂ 12, 2022, the Sponsor transferredÂ 176,094Â Founder Shares to George Syllantavos, andÂ 28,750Â Founder Shares to Anastasios Chrysostomidis. The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of the IPO would be a maximum ofÂ 14,375,000Â UnitsÂ if the underwritersâ over-allotment option were exercised in full, and therefore that such Founder Shares would representÂ 20% of the outstanding shares after the IPO. The underwritersâ over-allotment option was exercised in full, and no Founder Shares were forfeited.On FebruaryÂ 27, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,593,749 shares of ClassÂ A common stock to the Sponsor, A.G.P., George Syllantavos and Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of the ClassÂ B common stock, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of ClassÂ B common stock. These shares of class A common stock are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the ClassÂ B common stock before the conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination as described in the prospectus for the initial public offering. Following the conversion, the Sponsor was the beneficial owner of 3,033,905 shares of ClassÂ A common stock and one share of ClassÂ B common stock. The Sponsor then transferred 533,525 shares of ClassÂ A common stock to certain members of the Sponsor. Subsequent to those transfers, the Sponsor holds 2,500,380 shares of ClassÂ A common stock and one share of ClassÂ B common stock, as well as 653,750 shares of ClassÂ A common stock underlying private placement units, which units were acquired by the Sponsor in connection with the Companyâs initial public offering.Following the redemptions and the conversion of ClassÂ B common stock into shares of ClassÂ A common stock, there are currently 153,295 public shares outstanding and a total of 4,400,794 shares of ClassÂ A common stock and one share of ClassÂ B Common stock are outstanding, including the 2,500,380 shares of ClassÂ A common stock and the one share of ClassÂ B common stock that are beneficially owned by the Sponsor.The initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of (i)Â sixÂ months after the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or (ii)Â the date on which the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of ClassÂ A common stock for cash, securities or other property. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial stockholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of the shares of ClassÂ A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00Â per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20Â tradingÂ days within any 30-tradingÂ day period commencing at least 90Â days after the initial Business Combination, the Founder Shares will no longer be subject to such transfer restrictions.F-19

Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024Working Capital LoansIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Companyâs officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the âWorking Capital Loansâ). If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $1,500,000Â of such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent units at a price of $10.00Â per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issuedÂ 150,000Â units if $1,500,000Â of notes were so converted) at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms of such working capital loans by the Sponsor or its affiliates, or the Companyâs officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to the Working Capital Loans. The Company does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor as the Company does not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in the Trust Account. At DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.Administrative Service FeeThe Company entered into an administrative services agreement on the effective date of the registration statement for the IPO pursuant to which the Company will pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000Â perÂ month, for up to 18Â months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Companyâs initial Business Combination or its liquidation, the Company will cease paying theseÂ monthly fees. For theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024, the Company incurred and paid $120,000 of administrative service fees. For theÂ year ended DecemberÂ 31, 2023, the Company incurred and paid $120,000 of administrative service fees, all of which were fully paid.Due to Related PartyAt DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $28,771 and $889, respectively, due to a related party.Due from SponsorDue from Sponsor is a non-interest-bearing advance and is due on demand.

These holders will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company registers such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have âpiggybackâ registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by the Company.Â Notwithstanding the foregoing, the underwriters may not exercise their demand and âpiggybackâ registration rights after five and sevenÂ years, respectively, after the effective date of the registration statement of which the IPO forms a part and may not exercise their demand rights on more than one occasion.F-21

Subsequently, on DecemberÂ 31, 2023, the Public Warrants were reclassified to Level 3 as the Public Warrants were valued utilizing the market approach. The Company used the median warrant trading price of market comparable Special Purpose Acquisition Companies due to the lack of trading activity of the Companyâs warrants. The Company chose Special Purpose Acquisition Companies with a similar initial public offering size and warrant coverage for the analysis. This approach requires a significant amount of judgment and is highly susceptible to variability based on the sample of comparable Special Purpose Acquisition Companies used.The Private Warrants, since issuance, have been valued using a Monte Carlo model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. Inherent in a Monte Carlo options pricing model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on projected volatility of comparable public companies that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasuryÂ zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is based on management assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of completing a business combination. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. On DecemberÂ 31, 2023, the Private Warrants were valued utilizing the market approach, consistent with the valuation method applied to the Public Warrants.F-23
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024For theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the Public and Private Warrants were valued utilizing the market approach as described above. The changes in the fair value of the Companyâs Warrants have an effect on the Companyâs net income, however, the changes in fair value have no effect on the cash flows of the Company.The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 3 fair value measurements inputs at DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023 measurement dates for Public and Private Warrants:ââââââMeasurement DateÂ Â Â Â RangeÂ Â Â Â MedianDecember 31, 2024â$0.015 - $0.100â$ 0.036December 31, 2023â$0.010 - $0.063â$ 0.035âThe change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities, measured using Level 3 inputs, for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows:âââââÂ Â Â Â WarrantââLiabilitiesWarrant liabilities at December 31, 2023â$ 526,007Change in fair value of warrant liabilitiesâÂ  15,780Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2024â$ 541,787ââââââÂ Â Â Â WarrantââLiabilitiesWarrant liabilities at December 31, 2022Â $ 20,434Change in fair value of warrant liabilitiesââ 2,448Transfer to Level 3 from Level 2âÂ  503,125Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2023Â $ 526,007ââNoteÂ 9Â âÂ Warrant LiabilityAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, there wereÂ 15,028,750Â warrants outstanding. The Company accounted for theÂ 15,028,750Â warrants issued in connection with the IPO (14,375,000Â Public Warrants andÂ 653,750Â Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability is adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Companyâs consolidated statements of operations.Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Companyâs ClassÂ A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described herein. In addition, if (x)Â the Company issues additional shares of ClassÂ A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of ClassÂ A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Companyâs board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates, prior to such issuance) (the âNewly Issued Priceâ), (y)Â the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z)Â the volume weighted average trading price of the common stock during the 20Â trading day period starting on theÂ trading day prior to theÂ day on which the Company consummates the initial Business Combination (such price, the âMarket Valueâ) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under âRedemption of warrants when the price per share of ClassÂ A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00â will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.F-24
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30Â days after the completion of the initial Business Combination or 12Â months from the closing of this offering and will expire at 5:00Â p.m., NewÂ York City time on the warrant expiration date, which isÂ fiveÂ years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to the Company and not placed in the Trust Account.The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of ClassÂ A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of ClassÂ A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Companyâs satisfying the Companyâs obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of ClassÂ A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless ClassÂ A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of ClassÂ A common stock underlying such unit.The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15Â businessÂ days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of ClassÂ A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of ClassÂ A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of ClassÂ A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 52ndÂ day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a âcashless basisâ in accordance with SectionÂ 3(a)(9)Â of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the ClassÂ A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a âcovered securityâ under SectionÂ 18(b)(1)Â of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a âcashless basisâ in accordance with SectionÂ 3(a)(9)Â of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, the Company will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.Redemption of warrants when the price per share of ClassÂ A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00.Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):âin whole and not in part;âat a price of $0.01 per warrant;âupon not less than 30 daysâ prior written notice of redemption (the â30-day redemption periodâ) to each warrant holder; andâif, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.F-25

At DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.ClassÂ A Common StockThe Company is authorized to issueÂ 100,000,000Â shares of ClassÂ A common stock with a par value of $0.0001Â per share. Holders of ClassÂ A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 4,247,499 shares of ClassÂ A common stock issued or outstanding, respectively, excluding 63,241 and 153,295 shares subject to possible redemption, respectively.ClassÂ B Common StockThe Company is authorized to issueÂ 10,000,000Â shares of ClassÂ B common stock with a par value of $0.0001Â per share. Holders of the ClassÂ B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, there wasÂ 1 share of ClassÂ B common stock issued and outstanding. At DecemberÂ 31, 2022, there wereÂ 468,750Â ClassÂ B shares that were subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwritersâ over-allotment option was not exercised in full so that the Founder Shares would represent, on an as-converted basis,Â 20% of the Companyâs issued and outstanding shares after the IPO (assuming the Sponsor did not purchase any public shares in the IPO). As of FebruaryÂ 15, 2022, the over-allotment option was fully exercised and such shares were no longer subject to forfeiture.On FebruaryÂ 27, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,593,749 shares of its ClassÂ A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to the Sponsor, A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, George Syllantavos and Anastasios Chrysostomidis, the holders of the Companyâs ClassÂ B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of ClassÂ B Common Stock (the âConversionâ). The 3,593,749 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the shares of ClassÂ B Common Stock before the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination, as described in the prospectus for the Companyâs initial public offering. Following the Conversion, there are 4,400,794 shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock issued and outstanding and one share of ClassÂ B Common Stock issued and outstanding.F-26
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024The remaining share of ClassÂ B common stock will automatically convert into shares of ClassÂ A common stock at the time of the initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional shares of ClassÂ A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the IPO and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which shares of ClassÂ B common stock shall convert into shares of ClassÂ A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ClassÂ B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of ClassÂ A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of ClassÂ B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis,Â 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of the IPO (not including the shares of ClassÂ A common stock issuable to the Representative) plus all shares of ClassÂ A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination, any private placement-equivalent securities issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to the Company). The Company cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of the ClassÂ B common stock at the time of any future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i)Â closing conditions which are part of the agreement for the initial Business Combination; (ii)Â negotiation with ClassÂ A stockholders on structuring an initial Business Combination; or (iii)Â negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the ClassÂ B common stock. If such adjustment is not waived, the issuance would not reduce theÂ percentage ownership of holders of the ClassÂ B common stock but would reduce theÂ percentage ownership of holders of the ClassÂ A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the issuance would reduce theÂ percentage ownership of holders of both classes of the Companyâs common stock. Holders of Founder Shares may also elect to convert their shares of ClassÂ B common stock into an equal number of shares of ClassÂ A common stock, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time. The term âequity-linked securitiesâ refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of ClassÂ A common stock issues in a financing transaction in connection with the initial Business Combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt. Securities could be âdeemed issuedâ for purposes of the conversion rate adjustment if such shares are issuable upon the conversion or exercise of convertible securities, warrants or similar securities.NoteÂ 11Â â Income TaxThe Companyâs net deferred tax assets as of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:ââââââââÂ Â Â Â 2024Â Â Â Â 2023Deferred tax assetsÂ âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Organizational costs/start-up expensesâ$ 799,003â$ 658,644Total deferred tax assetsâÂ  799,003âÂ  658,644Valuation allowanceâÂ  (799,003)âÂ  (658,644)Deferred tax assets, net of allowanceâ$ ââ$ ââThe income tax provision for income taxes for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:ââââââââÂ Â Â Â 2024Â Â Â Â 2023FederalÂ âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Currentâ$ 81,983â$ 13,333DeferredâÂ  (140,359)âÂ  (432,190)StateâÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â CurrentâÂ  ââÂ  âDeferredâÂ  ââÂ  âChange in valuation allowanceâÂ  140,359âÂ  432,190Provision for income taxesâ$ 81,983â$ 13,333âAs of DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has no U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers, which do not expire, and no state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income.F-27
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties for theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For theÂ years ended DecemberÂ 31, 2024 and 2023, the change in the valuation allowance was $140,359 and $432,190, respectively.A reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the Companyâs effective tax rate is as follows:âââââââÂ Â Â Â December 31,Â Â Â Â December 31,Â ââ2024â2023Â Statutory federal income tax rateÂ  21.0%Â Â  21.0%State taxes, net of federal tax benefitÂ  0.0%Â Â  0.0%Change in fair value of warrantsÂ  (1.0)%Â Â  (0.6)%Acquisition facilitative expensesÂ  (3.3)%Â Â  (2.1)%Change in valuation allowanceÂ  (40.4)%Â Â  (18.9)%Income tax provisionÂ  (23.7)%Â Â  (0.6)%âThe Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company may be subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Companyâs management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelveÂ months.NoteÂ 12Â âÂ Segment ReportingASC Topic 280,Â âSegment Reporting,â establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statement information about operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers.Â Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which it may recognize revenues and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Companyâs chief operating decision maker, or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.The Companyâs chief operating decision maker (âCODMâ) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews the assets, operating results, and financial metrics for the Company as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, management has determined that there is only one reportable segment.F-28
Table of ContentsRELATIVITY ACQUISITION CORP.NOTESÂ TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDECEMBERÂ 31, 2024The CODM assesses performance for the single segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net loss that also is reported on the statements of operations as net income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheets as total assets. When evaluating the Companyâs performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics included in net loss and total assets, which include the following:âââââââââÂ Â Â Â December 31,Â Â Â Â December 31,ââ2024â2023Investments held in Trust Accountâ$ 769,267â$ 1,746,543Cashâ$ 1,674â$ 7,131âââââââââÂ Â Â Â For the Year Â Â Â Â For the Year ââEnded âEnded ââDecember 31, âDecember 31, ââ2024â2023General and administrative costsâ$ 741,798â$ 2,300,807Interest income on investments held in Trust Accountâ$ 38,883â$ 81,536âThe CODM reviews interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account to measure and monitor shareholder value and determine the most effective strategy of investment with the Trust Account funds while maintaining compliance with the Trust Agreement.General and administrative costs are reviewed and monitored by the CODM to manage and forecast cash to ensure enough capital is available to complete a business combination or similar transaction within the business combination period. The CODM also reviews these costs to manage, maintain and enforce all contractual agreements to ensure costs are aligned with all agreements and budget. General and administrative costs, as reported on the statements of operations, are the significant segment expenses provided to the CODM on a regular basis.All other segment items included in net income are reported on the statements of operations and described within their respective disclosures.NoteÂ 13Â âÂ Subsequent EventsThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the consolidated balance sheet date up to the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued. Based on this review, besides the event below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.Resignation of a DirectorOn JanuaryÂ 31, 2025, Mr.Â Francis Knuettel II, resigned as a Board member and as a member of our Audit Committee.
