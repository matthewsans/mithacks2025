Item 1.
BUSINESS
Background.
The
Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name “China Advanced Technology” as the successor by merger
to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. (“Vitalcare”). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent a holding company
reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding Corporation, and Vitalcare,
together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding Corporation subsequently reincorporated
in Nevada by merger into China Advanced.
Vitalcare
was in the business of administering medical clinics specializing in diabetes treatment. It was the successor to Network Financial Services,
Inc. (“Network”), which went public in an underwritten offering in 1987. Network was engaged in mortgage origination, and
changed its name to Westmark Group Holdings (“Westmark”) in 1993 in connection with the acquisition of Westmark Mortgage
from Primark Corporation. Westmark ceased operations at some time in 2006, and in 2006 ceased filing reports under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The corporate entity was thereafter known as Viking Consolidated, Inc. (2006), Tailor Aquaponics World Wide, Inc. (2007)
and Diversified Acquisitions (2007) until it entered the medical clinic business in early 2008. The Company has no information regarding
any business activities from 2006 after the mortgage origination business closed, to early 2008.
On
October 25, 2011, Goliath Film and Media International, a Nevada corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the
“Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which Goliath Film and Media International was acquired by China Advanced Technology.
Prior to the acquisition, our principal operations consisted of internet marketing, and were conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary,
Live Wise, Inc. Live Wise was disposed of on October 31, 2011 for cancellation of debt and shares described below. At the Closing Date,
there were no assets or liabilities on China Advanced Technology’s balance sheets.
The
transaction closed on October 31, 2011 (the “Closing Date”). On the Closing Date China Advanced Technology acquired Goliath
Film and Media International by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares after giving
effect to their issuance and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology’s prior control person. Immediately
following the Closing, 67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name of China Advanced Technology was
changed to Goliath Film and Media Holdings. All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an eight-for-1 forward stock split affected
as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on February 13, 2012.
Overview.
Goliath
Film and Media Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Goliath Film and Media International and Goliath Movie Partners 1, LLC
(collectively, “Goliath” or the “Company”), develops, produces and licenses for distribution, domestically and
internationally, quality digital content with an emphasis on “niche” markets of the feature motion picture and television
content segments of the entertainment industry, such as, without limitation, education, faith-based, horror and socially responsible
minority content. Goliath does not intend to engage in domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures to any significant extent.
In
qualified cases, Goliath will develop screenplays that will be outsourced to an independent entity for production, but will be licensed
for distribution through the Company. Also, in certain cases Goliath will produce content that is tied to working with an established
distributor that provides an advance or minimum guarantee for the production of a project that will be licensed by the participating
distributor. Goliath plans to produce content and to distribute domestically and internationally, through a wide distribution network
which includes major international theatrical exhibitors, and other distributors and television networks. We plan to utilize corporate
sponsorships as a means of reducing the costs of advertising and marketing in distribution. Further, we may augment our marketing efforts
with a limited and strategically focused advertising campaign in traditional “print” media with press releases targeted specifically
toward standard entertainment industry trade journals and publications on an “as needed” basis as well as the inclusion of
targeted “social media” campaigns.
Goliath’s
revenue model includes receiving revenue from distribution fees. A limited number of its content properties include projects developed
and produced by Goliath and those produced by an independent third party production companies.

Questions
and Answers
What
is your business?
We
develop, produce and distribute motion pictures and digital content. At this time, we do not intend to engage in theatrical releases
of motion pictures, due to the high up- front costs of advertising and marketing theatrically. However, in some specific cases the company
will consider theatrical releases based upon a “four wall”, limited release delivery that will be focused on targeted niche
audiences.
What
is the timeline for your activities during the next 12 months?
Over
the next 90 days to one year, our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by
them of at least three projects.
What
is this going to cost you?
We
expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately $150,000 per project, however licensing and distribution will
be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from 30 – 35% and the costs of advertising and marketing will be
handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds.
5
Why
are these motion pictures not being distributed already?
The
motion pictures that are being produced by the Company and distributed by Mar Vista take anywhere from six to nine months from completion
of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements.
Generally,
the main reason why good, quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity,
and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills. Many people dream of making a movie; few aspire to distribute
them. We estimate that there are in excess of 10,000 such motion pictures “gathering dust.” There also have been and continue
to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many States and international Territories, so that many producers do
not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects. A secondary factor is the difficulty of finding
a reputable distributor. We think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution
rights for content. Finally, many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films, because they see the
market as limited. Goliath sees the problem to be, rather, there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of
films for these niches. Most participants in the motion picture industry are based in “Hollywood” and the major coastal metropolitan
areas. As an example, our “faith-based” films especially are targeted toward the “Bible Belt” and the “Flyover
Country”: places that the industry has consistently overlooked.
Why
are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos?
After
attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years, our Staff has developed relationships
with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath has also developed vital relationships
with many of the major content buyers, distributors, networks and sales agents. Many of the filmmakers have requested the Company’s
assistance in marketing and distributing their product. Goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that
is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators, distributors, networks and studios.
So
how are you different than Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu, to name a few? How can you compete with them? They have a lot of money and name
recognition. Why wouldn’t they jump into your niches?
As
a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content. As an example,
NETFLIX using its “streaming platform” has such a high demand for programming content, they are spending in excess of $17
billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them. Therefore,
as is mentioned, part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting “in-house” and joint
venture productions of quality content. This content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level.
There
are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors, Goliath is moving toward becoming
one of these content providers. We believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming
is increasing almost exponentially. Irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumer/subscriber, the demand for quality content
is continuing to expand. The upward trend is ongoing, which is where we see an opportunity for Goliath to provide product to reach many
components of the overall market.
Don’t
cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like TBN (for faith based) and BET (Black Entertainment Television (for
the African-American Community)?
As
mentioned above about NETFLIX, even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type, genre and format of the content
that they are showing in order to remain viable, therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing
and expanding.
What
other niches are you looking at entering?
We
believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches. Many viewers have cable or satellite
service with hundreds of channels, but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests. The significant type of niche
we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the United States. Other than Spanish speaking immigrants, coverage is scarce.
There
are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming. As an example, in Hawaii and Southern California,
for instance, surfing is quite popular, and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest.
6
What
about ancillary markets?
We
plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible.
How
do these distribution rights work?
We
enter into a Distribution Agreement for each motion picture. Terms may be perpetual or limited by years. The motion pictures that we
are acquiring will have a term of five years. We will generally obtain a fee of 20% to 30% of gross revenues. Licensing will be flexible
for usage applications on a yearly or multi-year basis. Most markets, especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously
renew content licensing.
How
many employees do you have? Do you have an office?
We
have no employees. Our administrative office is in Carson City, Nevada.
Do
you have a website?
Our
website is www.goliathfilmandmediainternational.com. We have a mirror site at www.goliathfilmandmedia.com

RISK FACTORS.
Risks
Related to Our Business
Our
limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and to make decisions based on our historical
performance.
We
have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business on the basis of historical operations. As a consequence,
it is difficult to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results may not be representative
of the results we will achieve. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our
ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions
as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.
Economic
conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition
The
global economy is still undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility. We cannot predict when economic conditions will improve or stabilize.
A prolonged period of economic volatility or decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition and/or exacerbate the other risks related to its business.
Our
results of operations depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that we distribute,
and underperformance at the box office or in television licensing of one or more motion pictures in any period can cause our results
to be less than anticipated
Our
results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures and television programming that we
produce for distribution as well as content which we distribute, which cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, the underperformance
at the box office or on television, video on demand, or streaming, etc. of one or more motion pictures in any period may cause our revenue
and earnings results for that period (and potentially, subsequent periods) to be less than anticipated, in some instances to a significant
extent. Due to the difficulty of predicting our results of operations and the other factors, it is difficult for industry or financial
analysts to accurately forecast our results. The trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that
such industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If an analyst who covers us changes his or her financial estimates
or investment recommendation, or if our results of operations fall short of their estimates, the price of our common shares could decline.
7
Our
results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors
Our
results of operations will depend significantly upon the commercial success of the motion pictures or television content that we distribute,
or that which we produce for distribution which cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate
significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future periods. Our
results of operations also may fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and availability of our theatrical motion picture and home entertainment
releases, as well as license periods for our content. Our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period or fiscal
year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released compared to the corresponding period in the prior year or prior fiscal
year. Our operating results also fluctuate due to our accounting practices (which are standard for the industry) which may cause us to
recognize the production and marketing expenses in different periods than the recognition of related revenues, which may occur in later
periods. For example, in accordance with GAAP and industry practice, we are required to expense film advertising costs as incurred, but
are also required to recognize the revenue from any motion picture or television program over the entire revenue stream expected to be
generated by the individual picture or television program.
The
comparability of our results may be affected by changes in accounting guidance or changes in our ownership of certain assets and businesses.
Accordingly, our results of operations from year to year may not be directly comparable to prior reporting periods.
As
a result of the foregoing and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results
of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.
Our
success depends on the ability of our senior management team, as well as our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Our
success is highly dependent on the abilities of its management team. The management team must be able to effectively work together to
successfully conduct our current operations, as well as implement our strategy, which includes significant domestic expansion. If we
are unable to do so, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. In addition, as part of our strategy of international
expansion, there is intense competition for the services of qualified personnel. The failure to retain current key managers or key members
of the development, production, or marketing staff, or to hire additional qualified personnel for new operations could be detrimental
to our business.
Risks
Related to Our Securities
We
may raise capital in future offerings.
An
offering might require the participation of institutional investors, which are more likely to demand more stringent terms for any placement.
We have not determined the terms for any offering. Any future offering may be for common stock, or may be for a security with rights
superior to that of the common stock. In connection with any offering, we may be required to add investor’s representatives to
the Board of Directors, or may be required to commit to other conditions. If other conditions are not met, existing investors could have
their rights or equity ownership substantially diluted. We cannot at this time determine the terms of any follow-on offering or whether
it will ever occur.
We
do not expect to pay dividends on our outstanding shares in the foreseeable future.
We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not have, or anticipate having, any funds for such purpose in the foreseeable future. Even
if such funds become available, we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future but, instead, will use all funds from operations
for the continued development of the business.
8
Our
common stock is quoted only on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.
Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock
Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing
and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock, and could have a
long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.
Because
we became public by means of a “reverse merger,” we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.
Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide
coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We cannot assure you
that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of us in the future.
We
cannot assure you that the common stock will become liquid or that it will be listed on a securities exchange.
We
would like to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market as soon as practicable. However, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or of any other stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain any
such listing. We are presently on the OTC Bulletin Board and therefore, investor liquidity may be limited.
In
the event we seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we may be unable to
find additional capital on terms favorable to us and our stockholders.
In
the event that we need additional working capital for our projected operations, we may seek capital through debt or equity offerings
which could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital
stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock would result in a reduction of the percentage of ownership interest held by our existing
stockholders. Also, the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or the registration of any other
securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. Finally, we may not be able to find
additional capital on terms favorable to us through existing markets or investors due to market conditions, our historical performance,
or our stock price.
There
may be issuances of shares of preferred stock in the future.
Although
we currently do not have preferred shares outstanding, we could at some time in the future authorize preferred shares and the board of
directors could complete the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation,
the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders, and the right to the redemption of such shares,
possibly together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue preferred stock, the rights
of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including without limitation, with respect to liquidation.
Compliance
with corporate governance and disclosure standards is costly.
We
have spent and continue to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards
relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. Because we qualify as a smaller reporting company, our independent registered
public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report. However, there is no guarantee that we will receive management
assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting is effective
in future periods. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting
firm determines that our internal controls over financial reporting is not effective as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, investor
perceptions of us may be adversely affected. In addition, overhead may increase as a result of the additional costs associated with complying
with the complex legal requirements associated with being a public reporting company.
9
Our
compliance with SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly.
It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by
SEC rules including Sarbanes-Oxley. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in
order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley’s
internal controls requirements, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
publicly-traded companies to obtain.

Item 1C.
CYBERSECURITY
Our
board of directors and senior management recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, business
partners and employees. Our management, led by our Chief Executive Officer, are actively involved in oversight of our risk management
efforts, and cybersecurity represents an important component of the Company’s overall approach to enterprise risk management (“ERM”).
Our cybersecurity processes and practices are fully integrated into the Company’s ERM efforts. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity
risks through a cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information
that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity
incidents when they occur.
Risk
Management and Strategy
As
one of the critical elements of our overall ERM approach, our cybersecurity efforts are focused on the following key areas:
●
Governance: Management
oversees cybersecurity risk mitigation and reports to the board of directors any cybersecurity incidents.
●
Collaborative Approach:
We have implemented a cross-functional approach to identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents,
while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that
decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner.
●
Technical Safeguards:
We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls,
intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through
vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence.
We
have not engaged third-party service providers to conduct evaluations of our security controls, independent audits or consulting on best
practices to address new challenges.
While
we have not experienced any cybersecurity threats in the past in the normal course of business, in the future, we may not be successful
in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We
are not a party to or otherwise involved in any legal proceedings.
In
the ordinary course of business, from time to time we may be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation
process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our
financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters
currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the
critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding
our results. For additional information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The
following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting the Company.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions
are eliminated on consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’
estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations during the
period in which such changes occurred.
Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
Revenue
Recognition
On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, using the modified retrospective approach for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
12
The
Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation
by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive
in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
1.
Identification of the contract,
or contracts, with a customer.
2.
Identification of the performance
obligations in the contract.
3.
Determination of the transaction
price.
4.
Allocation of the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract
5.
Recognition of revenue
when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
At
contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation
for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations,
the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by
customary business practices. The Company allocates the entire transaction price to a single performance obligation.
The
Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on history and experience considering economic and industry trends. The
Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.
The
Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all
technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system.
The
Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as
commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing
prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company
generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.
The Company recognizes revenue from the distribution of its films on a net revenue basis as Mar Vista distributes the films to Mar Vista’s
end customers.
For
the year ended April 30, 2025 we had revenues of $32,726 compared to $47,674 for the year ended April 30, 2024. Revenues in fiscal year
2025 were due to distribution fees paid to us by Mar Vista related to the motion pictures “Merry Ex’s” of $16,398 and
“Bridal Boot Camp” of $16,328. Revenues in fiscal year 2024 were due to distribution fees paid to us by Mar Vista related
to the motion pictures “Merry Ex’s” of $28,292 and “Bridal Boot Camp” of $19,382.
Films
Costs
The
Company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20, “Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film
Costs”. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production
based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates its capitalized production
costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future sales. As of April 30, 2025 and
2024, the Company had no production costs.
Stock-Based
Compensation
In
accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation costs
of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over
the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted
share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured
on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the
option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than employees are
recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees
(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date
is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete
or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and
circumstances of each particular grant as defined in ASC 505.
13
Fair
Value Measurements
FASB
ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well
as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt. Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
Various
inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies used
for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are
summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
●
Level 1 – observable
market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2 – other significant
observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).
●
Level 3 – significant
unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).
The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The
Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets
and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.
The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at April 30, 2025 and 2024. Assets
and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
The
availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the
type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial
instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants,
and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable
in the market and may require management judgment. The Company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative
financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions
and projections to determine fair value. These require management’s judgment.
Basic
and diluted earnings per share
Diluted
earnings (loss) per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares (including common stock subject to
redemption) plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the reporting period. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average
number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The
total number of potential additional dilutive securities outstanding for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 was none.
14
Concentrations,
Risks, and Uncertainties
The
Company’s working capital financing has entirely come from related parties and revenue received and recognized during the fiscal
years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
The
Company has one customer, Mar Vista, that accounted for all of the Company’s gross sales during 2025 and 2024.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.
Plan
of Operations
The
Company had a net loss of $37,332 and $396 for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and historical losses totaling
$1,109,932. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
management plan to continue as a going concern revolves around its ability to execute its business strategy of distributing digital content,
as well as raising the necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company.

expenses increased by $21,988, or 45.7%, to $70,058 in the year ended April 30, 2025 from $48,070 in the year ended April 30, 2024 primarily
due to increases in consulting costs of $16,443, professional fees of $13,027, and $18 of other operating expenses, offset primarily
by the write off of prepaid expenses of $7,500.
Operating
expenses for the year ended April 30, 2025 were comprised primarily of professional fees of $38,386, consulting costs of $31,443, and

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $17,695 for the year ended April 30, 2025 primarily due to advances from related party. Net
cash used in financing activities was $3,800 for the year ended April 30, 2024 primarily due to advances from related party of $11,150,
offset primarily by repayment of advances from related party of $14,950.
Our
cash needs in the year ended April 30, 2026 are estimated to be $200,000. This budget is based on the assumption that we will carry out
one project at a time for which we will need about $50,000 in working capital; general and administrative expenses of $150,000 for the
costs related to being public, and miscellaneous office expenses. We sold no shares of common stock in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. As
we move forward with our business plan, we will need to raise additional capital either through the sale of stock or funding from shares
and or officers and directors to cover our cash needs through the end of the 2026 fiscal year.

16
Equity
Financing
During
the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not enter into any private placement memorandums.
During
fiscal years 2025 and 2024, the Company has not issued a total of 38,153,269 common shares (6,000,000 common shares due to a third party
and 32,153,269 common shares due to related party affiliates). These shares are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements but they are not included in the Company’s outstanding shares balance of 138,964,917.
Advances
from related party
The
Company borrows funds from the Company’s affiliates for working capital purposes from time to time. The Company has recorded the

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Goliath Film & Media Holdings:
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Goliath Film & Media Holdings (“the Company”) as of April
30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years
in the two-year period ended April 30, 2025 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
April 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company does not have significant cash or current assets, nor does it have an established source of
revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR
THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2025 AND 2024
NOTE
1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization,
Nature of Business and Trade Name
The
Company was incorporated in Nevada on February 16, 2010 under the name “China Advanced Technology” as the successor by merger
to Vitalcare Diabetes Treatment Centers, Inc. (“Vitalcare”). In February and March 2010, Vitalcare underwent a holding company
reorganization under Delaware law, pursuant to which it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitalcare Holding Corporation, and Vitalcare,
together with its assets and liabilities, was sold to a non-affiliated third party. Vitalcare Holding Corporation subsequently reincorporated
in Nevada by merger into China Advanced.
On
October 31, 2011 (the “Closing Date”), China Advanced acquired Goliath Film and Media International, a California corporation,
by issuing 47,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, constituting 70.1% of the outstanding shares after giving effect to their issuance
and the cancellation of 15,619,816 shares held by China Advanced Technology’s prior control person. Immediately following the Closing,
67,100,000 shares were issued and outstanding. On the Closing Date, the name of China Advanced Technology was changed to Goliath Film
and Media Holdings (“Goliath” or “the Company”). All share numbers herein have been adjusted for an eight-for-1
forward stock split affected as of the Closing Date. The forward stock split was reflected in the trading market on February 13, 2012.
The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which Goliath Film and Media International is deemed to be the accounting
acquirer, and the prior operations of Goliath (formerly China Advanced Technology) are consolidated for accounting purposes.
The
Company is engaged in the production and distribution of motion pictures and television content. The Company has begun its planned principal
business purpose with revenue consisting of primarily film residuals.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Goliath Film and Media Holdings and its subsidiary, Goliath Film
and Media International (“Goliath” or “the Company”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations
for the periods presented.
The
Company currently operates in one business segment. The Company is not organized by market and is managed and operated as one business.
A single management team reports to the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, who comprehensively manages the
entire business. The Company does not currently operate any separate lines of businesses or separate business entities.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. A change in managements’
estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations during the
period in which such changes occurred.
Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes
are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
F-6
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable, if any, are carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will be based
on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there
were a deterioration of a major customer’s creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates
of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.
The
Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carrying accounts
receivable.
Films
Costs
The
Company capitalizes production costs for films produced in accordance with ASC 926-20, “Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film
Costs”. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production
based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. The Company evaluates its capitalized production
costs annually and limits recorded amounts by its ability to recover such costs through expected future sales. As of April 30, 2025 and
2024, the Company had no production costs.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation
by transferring control of the promised services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive
in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
1.
Identification of the contract,
or contracts, with a customer.
2.
Identification of the performance
obligations in the contract.
3.
Determination of the transaction
price.
4.
Allocation of the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract
5.
Recognition of revenue
when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
At
contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in our contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation
for each promise to transfer to the customer a service (or bundle of services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations,
the Company considers all of the services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by
customary business practices. The Company allocates the transaction prices to the performance obligations.
The
Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on history and experience considering economic and industry trends. The
Company does not have any off-Balance Sheet exposure related to its customers.
The
Company recognizes revenue when the distributor confirms to the Company that the film has been delivered to the distributor with all
technical and document deliveries received, waived or deferred and the film has been entered into the distributor’s rights system.
The Company recognizes revenue from the distribution of its films on a net revenue basis as Mar Vista distributes the films to Mar Vista’s
end customers. Costs are borne by the distributor.
F-7
The
Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as
commissions. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing
prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. The Company
generally records the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices.
For
the year ended April 30, 2025 we had revenues of $32,726 compared to $47,674 for the year ended April 30, 2024. Revenues in fiscal year
2025 were due to distribution fees paid to us by Mar Vista for the motion pictures “Merry Ex’s” of $16,398 and “Bridal
Boot Camp” of $16,328. Revenues in fiscal year 2024 were due to distribution fees paid to us by Mar Vista related to the motion
pictures “Merry Ex’s” of $28,292 and “Bridal Boot Camp” of $19,382.
Advertising
Advertising
expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. There was no advertising expense for the years ended
April 30, 2025 and 2024 as the company is not currently promoting its films.
Research
and Development
All
research and development costs are expensed as incurred. There was no research and development expense for the years ended April 30,
2025 and 2024.
Income
Tax
We
account for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
No. 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Fair
Value Measurements
FASB
ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well
as in annual reports. For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt. Also, FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
Various
inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company’s investments and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies used
for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are
summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
●
Level 1 – observable
market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2 – other significant
observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).
●
Level 3 – significant
unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).
The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The
Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets
and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.
The Company had no financial assets and/or liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at April 30, 2025. Assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
F-8
The
availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the
type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial
instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants,
and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable
in the market and may require management judgment. The Company uses fair value measurements for determining the valuation of derivative
financial instruments payable in shares of its common stock. This primarily involves option pricing models that incorporate certain assumptions
and projections to determine fair value. These require management’s judgment.
Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Share
Diluted
earnings (loss) per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares (including common stock subject to
redemption) plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the reporting period. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average
number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The
total number of potential additional dilutive securities outstanding for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 was none.
Concentrations,
Risks, and Uncertainties
The
Company’s working capital financing has entirely come from related parties and revenue received and recognized during the fiscal
years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
The
Company has one customer, Mar Vista, that accounted for all of the Company’s gross sales during 2025 and 2024.
Stock-Based
Compensation
In
accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), we measure the compensation costs
of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over
the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted
share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured
on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the
option grant. We apply this statement prospectively. Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than employees are
recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees
(“ASC 505”) defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date
is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete
or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and
circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the ASC 505.
Recently
Enacted Accounting Standards
The
Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.
NOTE
2 – COMMON STOCK
The
Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, with such rights, preferences and designation and to be
issued in such series as determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding at April 30, 2025
and 2024.
F-9
The
Company has authorized 199,000,000 shares of par value $0.001 common stock, of which 138,964,917 and 138,964,917 shares are outstanding
at April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. No shares of common stock have been issued during the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
As
of April 30, 2025, the Company has not issued an aggregate 38,153,269 common shares to three shareholders (a total of 32,153,269 to related
parties and 6,000,000 to a third party). These shares are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but they
are not included in the Company’s outstanding shares balance of 138,964,917.
NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN
The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However,
the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to
cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from
the issuance of these financial statements.
Under
the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention
nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly,
assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in
the normal course of business.
The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements is dependent upon
its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the following paragraphs and eventually attain profitable operations. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.
During
the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business,
maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company may experience
a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.
Historically,
the Company has relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock and related party loans to finance
its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s
stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The
Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon its and its shareholders.
In
the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through loans from related parties. For the coming year,
the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances, focus on a possible joint venture
or merger until the company generates revenues through the operations of such merged company or joint venture as stated above.

NOTE
5 – INCOME TAXES
As
of April 30, 2025, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,110,000, which expire in varying amounts between
2026 and 2042. Realization of this potential future tax benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration
of the loss carryforward. The deferred tax asset related to this (and other) potential future tax benefits has been offset by a valuation
allowance in the same amount. The amount of the deferred tax asset ultimately realizable could be increased in the near term if estimates
of future taxable income during the carryforwards period are revised.
Deferred
income tax assets of approximately $311,000 at April 30, 2025, was offset in full by a valuation allowance.
The
approximate components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, including a valuation allowance, are as follows:

Legal
The

or results of operations.

Company is obligated to pay motion picture residual payments of approximately 3.6% of gross licensing revenues collected by Mar Vista

We
did not have any disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure with our accounting firm during the reporting period.
Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported accurately, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and within the required time periods, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report (April 30, 2025),
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective to enable us to accurately record, process, summarize and report certain information required to be included in the Company’s
periodic SEC filings within the required time periods, and to accumulate and communicate to our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO-2013”). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025.
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
This
annual report on internal control over financial reporting does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s
report in this Annual Report.
Changes
in Internal Controls
There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended April 30, 2025 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.
Item 9B.
OTHER INFORMATION
During
the year ended April 30, 2025, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule

DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE
OFFICERS, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
Directors
and Executive Officers
The
member of the Board of Directors of Goliath Film and Media Holdings serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or until their
successors have been elected. The officer serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The following are the directors and executive
officers of Goliath Film and Media Holdings.
Lamont
Robert, President, Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer
Lamont
Roberts, 70, has been President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Goliath since October, 2011. In 1997 he co-founded Millennium
Personal and Business Management Corporation with Wilt Chamberlain, representing and managing a client base comprising actors, athletes,
directors, musicians and writers. In the late 1990s, Mr. Roberts also began producing film and television projects. In 2003, he was hired
as the Executive Director of Reel Image, Inc., a content funding corporation. As the head of Reel Image, Inc., he is working on distributing
a documentary that he wrote and produced entitled “Chosen By God- the Great Black Pharaohs of the 25th Dynasty.”
As an independent producer, Mr. Roberts produced the feature films “The Truth About Layla,” and “The Marina Murders.”
He acted as an Associate Producer on the feature film “Seducing Spirits,” and was the executive in charge of production for
the feature film “The Perfect Argument,” and the documentaries “Film Struggle,” and “Living with Cancer.”
Mr. Roberts has a BSBA in Finance and an MA in Real Estate and Urban Economics from the University of Florida. He is a best-selling author
and lives in Marina Del Rey, CA.
Mike
Criscione, Director
Mike
Criscione, 74, has been on the Board since May 1, 2014 and has been a highly successful business man and real estate developer. He brought
this extensive experience to the film business in 1991, producing “LA Goddess”. From 2008 to the present Mr. Criscione has
directed, financed and produced numerous commercials, music videos, several motion pictures, and documentaries. He is a graduate of Vision
Bible College in Whittier, California where he earned his Bachelor degree.
Director
Independence
Currently,
the Company does not have any independent directors. Since the Company’s Common Stock is not currently listed on a national securities
exchange, we have used the definition of “independence” of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination.
Under
NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2), an “independent director” is a “person other than an officer or employee of the company
or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.”
We
do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. However, we do intend to comply with the independent
director and committee composition requirements in the future.
Limitation
of Liability and Indemnification
Goliath’s
Articles of Incorporation provisions may be interpreted to provide for the indemnification of officers and directors for certain civil
liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. In the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification
is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
Code
of Ethics
Goliath
Film and Media Holdings has not adopted a code of ethics which applies to the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief
financial officer, because of our level of operations of the public entity in 2024.
21
Audit
Committee Financial Expert
Goliath
Film and Media Holdings does not have either an Audit Committee or a financial expert on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
believes that obtaining the services of an audit committee financial expert is not economically rational at this time in light of the
costs associated with identifying and retaining an individual who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert, the limited scope
of our operations and the relative simplicity of our financial statements and accounting procedures.
Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Goliath Film and Media Holdings officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and
ten percent stockholders are required by regulation to furnish Goliath Film and Media Holdings with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. The Company’s common stock did not become registered under the Exchange Act until after the year ended April 30, 2012,
so Section 16(a) is not applicable to the Company.
