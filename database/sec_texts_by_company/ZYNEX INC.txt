(“ZMI”) and Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS”).​​1
Table of ContentsPART IITEM 1. BUSINESSHistoryZynex, Inc. was founded by Thomas Sandgaard in 1996, when he founded two privately held companies that were eventually folded into Zynex, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Zynex, Inc. is the parent company of two active subsidiaries; Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) and Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation). Substantially all of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2024 and 2023 is attributable to ZMI. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado.OverviewZynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI): ZMI designs, manufactures and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. The Company’s devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All of our medical devices are designed to be patient friendly and designed for home use. Our devices are small, portable, battery operated, and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. All of our medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to FDA regulation and clearance. Our products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. Our primary product is the NexWave device. The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by our field sales representatives. The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients, as needed.ZMI distributes private labeled rehabilitation products such as back, knee and wrist braces, cervical and lumbar traction, and hot/cold therapy (“Private Labeled Rehabilitation Products”). These complement our pain management products and are critical for physicians and therapists. These products require a prescription and are covered by most insurance plans and Medicare.ZMI designs, manufactures, and markets the NeuroMove product. The NeuroMove contains electromyography and electric stimulation technology that is primarily used for stroke, spinal cord injury (“SCI”) and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) rehabilitation by reaching parts of the brain to re-connect with muscles, also known as neuroplasticity. The NeuroMove product is primarily marketed to medical clinics. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2024 or 2023.ZMI also designs, manufactures, and markets the InWave product, an in-home electrical stimulation device used to treat female urinary incontinence. The device requires a prescription and is covered by most insurance plans and Medicare. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2024 or 2023.ZMI designs, manufactures and markets the M-Wave product, which was cleared by the FDA in February 2024. The M-Wave is a user-friendly NMES device designed for muscle stimulation and re-education. M-Wave is a fully programmable, compact, battery-powered device with adjustable treatment timer, compliance meter, biphasic or monophasic waveforms, and exceptional safety features. The M-Wave is marketed to physicians and therapists and requires consumable supplies, electrodes and batteries, for use. The Company does not anticipate a material financial impact of the M-Wave on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.​Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):​ZMS was formed in 2011 to develop and market medical devices for non-invasive patient monitoring beginning with our Zynex Fluid Monitoring System. The monitor is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring relative fluid volume changes used in operating and recovery rooms to detect fluid loss during surgery and internal bleeding during recovery. The CM-1500 received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in February 2020 and the wireless CM-1600 received clearance in June 2023.​2
Table of ContentsThe Zynex Fluid Monitoring System has been tested in several Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approved clinical studies, both in well-controlled healthy volunteer settings as well as in clinical use environments. In 2024, devices were placed in healthy volunteer studies at national blood donation centers in order to evaluate the specific changes in the measured parameters as well as the device’s patented Relative Index (“RI”) during minor blood loss. ​We have built a number of commercial devices in pilot production and continue to refine the algorithms for the patented Relative Index. We have received two U.S. utility patents for this unique application, the first in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the second in the first quarter of 2021, and we believe this product could serve a currently unmet need in the market to enable safer surgeries and safer monitoring of patients during recovery.​On December 22, 2021, ZMS acquired Kestrel Labs Inc. (“Kestrel”), which had two pulse-oximeter products in development and multiple patents. In early 2022, the integration of Kestrel and its pulse oximetry products into the ZMS organization was completed. Pulse oximetry is a commonly used noninvasive monitoring method for estimation of oxygen saturation in arterial blood. The inaccuracies of traditional Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) based pulse oximeters have recently been highlighted specific to skin pigmentation bias and the inability to accurately measure blood oxygen levels in the presence of other conditions such as in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning or methemoglobinemia. ZMS’ investigational laser-based products are designed to address these inaccuracies and include the novel NiCO™ CO-Oximeter, and HemeOx™, a total hemoglobin oximeter that is designed to enable continuous noninvasive arterial blood monitoring. NiCO is anticipated to be submitted to the FDA for clearance in Q1 2025. NiCO is currently undergoing Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approved clinical studies on human subjects to measure hypoxemia. Enrollments at the University of California, San Francisco and the initial phase of a healthy volunteer study at Duke Univeristy have been completed. The completed enrollments at Duke will be submitted as part of the 510(k) submission for NiCO. Ongoing enrollments at Duke will be used for future development. As ZMS’ products are still in development, ZMS did not produce any revenue for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023.In addition to the fluid volume monitor, ZMS filed for a provisional patent for a non-invasive sepsis monitor in December 2020 and an updated utility patent, which was filed in December 2021.SALES AND GROWTH STRATEGIESTo date, ZMI accounts for substantially all of our revenue and profit. We are focused on expanding our sales force to address what we believe is an untapped market for electrotherapy products and pain management. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 350 field sales representatives on staff or in the hiring process. We continue to hire field sales representatives, focusing on the quality of each candidate with the goal of increasing performance management standards for our sales force as a whole.In an effort to increase revenue and diversification, we provide our prescribers and patients with diverse solutions for their pain management needs. We are continually adding new complementary products to our ZMI sales channel, in addition to our current Distributed Products. We believe adding these complementary products will increase our market share and, in the future, grow our core business by providing our electrotherapy patients additional non-pharmacological pain relief and complementary products to our manufactured devices.Distribution and Revenue Streams:Substantially all our revenue is generated through our ZMI subsidiary from our electrotherapy products. We sell through a direct sales force in the United States. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated with a base salary plus incentive compensation aligned to corporate objectives. Our efforts to date have been focused on the United States market. Our revenue is derived from several sources including patients with insurance plans held by commercial health insurance carriers or government payers who pay on behalf of their insureds. The remaining portion of revenue is primarily received from workers’ compensation claims, auto claims, attorneys representing injured patients, hospitals, clinics, and private-pay individuals. 3
Table of ContentsA large part of our revenue is recurring. Recurring revenue results primarily from the sale of surface electrodes and batteries sent to existing patients with our devices. Electrodes and batteries are consumable items that are considered an integral part of our products.Private Labeled Rehabilitation ProductsIn addition to our own products, we offer our suite of Private Labeled Rehabilitation Products, through our sales force, a number of private labeled supplies and complementary products from other manufacturers. Customarily, there are no formal contracts between vendors in the durable medical equipment industry. Replacement products and components are easily found, either from our own products or other manufacturers, and purchases are made by purchase order.​ProductsWe currently market and sell Zynex-manufactured products and distribute private labeled rehabilitation products and supplies for Zynex products, as indicated below:​Product Name    Description​​​Zynex Medical Products​  ​

Table of ContentsProduct UsesPain Management and ControlStandard electrotherapy is a clinically proven and medically accepted alternative to manage acute and chronic pain. Electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce most types of local pain, such as tennis elbow, neck or lower back pain, arthritis, and others. The devices used to accomplish this are commonly described as the TENS family of devices. Electrotherapy is not known to have any negative side effects, a significant advantage over most pain relief medications. The benefits of electrotherapy can include pain relief, increased blood flow, reduced edema, prevention of venous thrombosis, increased range-of-motion, prevention of muscle disuse atrophy, and reduced urinary incontinence.Electrotherapy introduces an electrical current applied through surface electrodes. The electrical current “distorts” a pain signal on its way to the central nervous system and the brain, thus reducing the pain. Additionally, by applying higher levels of electricity, muscles contract and such contraction is believed to assist in the benefits mentioned above.Numerous clinical studies have been published over several decades showing the effectiveness of IFC and TENS for pain relief. Our primary electrotherapy device, the NexWave, has received FDA 510(k) clearance. The NexWave is a digital IFC, TENS and NMES device that delivers pain-alleviating electrotherapy.Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury (“SCI”) RehabilitationOur proprietary NeuroMove product is a Class II medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for stroke rehabilitation. Stroke and SCI usually affect a survivor’s mobility, functionality, speech, and memory, and the NeuroMove is designed to help the survivor regain movement and functionality.Sales of NeuroMove did not generate material revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.Fluid MonitoringFluid monitoring involves measuring a patient’s fluid balance, especially regarding fluid inputs and outputs contributing to total intravascular volume. Adequate fluid balance is vital for patient stability and recovery, as both low and high volumes outside of the desired range are associated with complications. Maintaining effective circulating blood volume and pressure are key to assuring adequate oxygen saturation and perfusion. Monitoring methods used for hemodynamic and intravascular volume monitoring have been historically classified as (a) invasive, using a central or pulmonary artery catheter, (b) minimally invasive, with the placement of an arterial line, and (c) noninvasive, where no device is inserted into the body for clinical assessment.The Zynex Fluid Monitoring System CM-1500 and the Zynex Wireless Fluid Monitoring System CM-1600 are noninvasive monitoring devices designed to measure relative changes in fluid volume in adult patients. Fluid status is determined using Zynex’s proprietary algorithm and expressed as the patented Relative Index™, a simple value designed to accurately trend patient vital signs and alert clinicians for early intervention.The CM-1500 was cleared by the FDA in 2020, and the wireless CM-1600 was cleared in June 2023 by the FDA.Pulse Oximetry MonitoringPulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of measuring the oxygen saturation level (“SpO2”) of arterial blood. As one of the most common medical devices used in and out of hospitals around the world, pulse oximeters have gained widespread clinical acceptance as the standard of care for monitoring oxygen saturation. SpO2 has become the “fifth vital sign”, which, together with heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature, provides crucial clinical information about a person’s health status.The NiCO™ Noninvasive CO-Oximeter, the first laser photoplethysmographic patient monitoring technology, is designed to noninvasively measure and monitor four crucial species of hemoglobin with unprecedented accuracy.5
Table of ContentsThe HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Pulse Oximeter is designed to noninvasively measure total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation, two critical parameters that typically require invasive arterial blood sampling for measurement. Total hemoglobin is a very commonly ordered blood test in healthcare, and HemeOx™ measures it with the continuous and noninvasive ease of a pulse oximeter at the patient bedside.The NiCO™ Noninvasive CO-Oximeter and the HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Pulse Oximeter have not yet been cleared by the FDA.MARKETSZynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI):To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated by our ZMI electrotherapy products, private labeled supplies, and private labeled rehabilitation products. Thus, we primarily compete in the home electrotherapy market for pain management and rehabilitation. We estimate the annual domestic market for home electrotherapy and rehabilitation products at approximately $500 million to $1 billion. During 2024 and 2023, we maintained our sales force of approximately 350-450 direct sales representatives to address what we believe is an underserved electrotherapy market. The current opioid epidemic has been declared a health emergency, and we are uniquely positioned to help reduce the number of opioids prescribed for treatment of chronic and acute pain symptoms. We are committed to providing healthcare professionals with alternatives to traditional opioid-based treatment programs with our prescription-strength products which have no side effects. This has never been more necessary than it is today considering the staggering statistics.●Pain impacts the lives of more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined.●Pain is the leading cause of disability, and seeking treatment for chronic or acute pain is the most common reason American’s seek health care. Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain.●Nearly 20 million Americans experienced high-impact chronic pain, defined as “limiting life or work activities on most days or every day in the past 3 months”.●If pharmaceuticals such as opioids continue to be used as the first line of defense, America will continue to see a rise in opioid misuse, addiction, and drug-related deaths.Key characteristics of our electrotherapy and rehabilitation market are:●Collection cycles of initial payment from insurance carriers can range from less than 30 days to many months and considerably longer for many attorney, personal injury, and workers’ compensation cases. Such delayed payment can negatively impact our cash flow and can slow our growth or strain our liquidity. Collections are also impacted by whether effective billing submissions are made by our billing and collections department to the third-party payers.●Prior to payment, third-party payers often make or take significant payment adjustments or discounts. This can also lead to denials and billing disputes with third-party payers.●The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of medical devices and recurring patient supplies from our electrotherapy products sold through ZMI. We are reliant on third-party payer reimbursement.Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):ZMS is focused on developing products within the non-invasive multi-parameter patient-monitoring marketplace. ZMS is currently focusing on its laser pulse oximetry and total hemoglobin products acquired in its acquisition of Kestrel Labs. We believe our products, once released into the marketplace (of which there can be no guarantee), will compete against multiple competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited range of products. ZMS has not generated any revenue to date.6
Table of ContentsCompetitionSince we are in the market for medical electrotherapy products, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Our principal competitors include International Rehabilitative Sciences, Inc. d/b/a RS Medical, EMSI, and H-Wave. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies. RESOURCESManufacturing and Product AssemblyOur manufacturing and product assembly strategy consists of the following elements:●Compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.●Use of contract manufacturers as needed, thereby allowing us to quickly respond to changes in volume and avoid large capital investments for assembly and manufacturing equipment of certain product components. We believe there is a large pool of highly qualified contract manufacturers, domestically and internationally, for the type of manufacturing assistance needed for our manufactured devices.●Utilization of in-house final assembly and test capabilities.●Development of proprietary software and hardware for all products in-house.●Testing all units in a real-world, in-house environment to help ensure the highest possible quality and patient safety while reducing the cost of warranty repairs.We utilize contract manufacturers located in the U.S. to manufacture components for our NexWave and NeuroMove units and for some of our other products and assemble in-house for our NexWave and NeuroMove units. We do not have long-term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers, but we utilize purchase orders with agreed upon terms for our ongoing needs. We believe there are numerous suppliers that can manufacture our products and provide our required raw materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of our required raw materials and components. We are always evaluating our suppliers for price, quality, delivery time, and service. The reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations.Intellectual PropertyZynex is committed to aggressively protecting the intellectual property rights the Company has worked so hard to obtain and to expand our intellectual property portfolio for advances to our existing products and for new products as they are developed.Zynex has received two U.S. utility patents, as well as a utility patent in Europe, for our fluid monitoring system. The acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc. included an intellectual property portfolio surrounding the acquired laser photoplethysmographic technology. This expands both the size and scope of Zynex’s intellectual property portfolio to include key aspects of the exciting pulse oximetry market. Additional patents for photoplethysmographic technology were filed in 2023 and 2024. Zynex also received issued trademarks for NiCO™ and HemeOx™ by the US Patent Trade Office (“USPTO”) in 2023.Zynex is trademarked in the U.S.We utilize non-disclosure and trade secret agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary information.7
Table of ContentsGOVERNMENT REGULATIONUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA)All of our ZMI products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA, and clinical studies with our products are considered to be Non-Significant Risk Studies (“NSR”). Our business is regulated by the FDA, and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put into commercial distribution. Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, is available in certain instances for Class II devices. It requires that, before introducing most Class II devices into interstate commerce, the sponsor must first submit information to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to March 1976 or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. When the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, the agency issues a “clearance” letter that authorizes marketing of the product. We are also regulated by the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which sets forth current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) requirements for devices. We believe that our products have obtained or are good candidates for the requisite FDA clearance or are exempt from the FDA clearance process. In November 2001, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market NeuroMove. In September 2011, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the NexWave, our current generation IFC, TENS and NMES device. In August 2012, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the InWave, our next generation muscle stimulator for treatment of female incontinence. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could adversely affect us.InternationalWe comply with applicable regulatory requirements within the markets in which we currently sell. If and when we decide to enter additional geographic areas, we intend to comply with applicable regulatory requirements within those markets.In 2019, Zynex received ISO13485: 2016 certification for its compliance with international standards in quality management systems for design, development, manufacturing, and distribution of medical devices. This certification is not only important as assurance that we have the appropriate quality systems in place but is also crucial to our international expansion efforts as many countries require this certification as part of their regulatory approval. Government RegulationThe delivery of health care services and products has become one of the most highly regulated professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services and products. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each program is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state’s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. Many state and local jurisdictions impose additional legal and regulatory requirements on our business including various states and local licenses, taxes, limitations regarding insurance claim submission and limitations on relationships with referral parties. Failure to comply with this myriad of regulations in a particular jurisdiction may subject us to fines or other penalties, including the inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.Federal healthcare laws apply to us when we submit a claim to any other federally funded healthcare program, in addition to requirements to meet government standards. The principal federal laws that we must abide by in these situations include:●Those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment.●Those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded healthcare programs.The federal government may impose criminal, civil, and administrative penalties on anyone who files a false claim for reimbursement from federally funded programs.8
Table of ContentsA federal law commonly known as the “anti-kickback law” prohibits the knowing or willful solicitation, receipt, offer, or payment of any remuneration made in return for:●The referral of patients covered under federally funded healthcare programs; or●The purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any goods, facility, items, or service reimbursable under those programs.Healthcare RegulationFederal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”). We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. In addition, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”), created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and certain advanced non-physician healthcare practitioners and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.Research and DevelopmentResearch and Development costs are expensed when incurred. During 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately $12.0 million and $9.2 million in operating expenses, respectively, related to our ZMS operations. During 2024 and 2023, approximately $9.2 million and $7.7 million of operating expenses, respectively, required capitalization under Section 174 - “Amortization of Research and Experimental Expenditures” tax treatment. HUMAN CAPITALAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,000 full time employees.9
Table of ContentsOur employees are our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. All our employees contribute to our success and, in particular, our sales representatives are instrumental in our ability to reach more patients in pain.The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed recruitment and retention strategies, objectives, and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives, and measures form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:●Competitive pay and benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve superior results.●Training and development. We invest in learning opportunities that foster a growth mindset. Our formal offerings include a tuition reimbursement program, an e-learning program that all corporate employees have access to, and in-house learning opportunities through the Company’s Zynex Growth and Development program.●Health and Wellness. We invest in the health and wellness of our employees by offering monthly benefits and offer programs and support to assist our employees.​ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATEUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns, including SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic (such as COVID-19) and various variants, as well as military conflicts or wars (such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Palestine) that can cause exacerbated volatility and disruptions to various aspects of the global economy, and other disruptions to global supply chains. Each of these events has caused or may continue to result in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, whether due to inflationary pressures or otherwise, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payers or our collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.Rapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to effectively compete.The technologies underlying our products are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. We can give no assurance that others will not develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services, and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We plan to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressure and technologies, but we may not be successful. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:●properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;●develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;10
Table of Contents●adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;●demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products, including through the conduct of additional clinical trials;●obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements; and●achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products.​If we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material, or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not be covered or reimbursed by government healthcare programs such as Medicare or private health plans, may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, and/or may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.We are dependent on reimbursement from third-party payers, most of whom are larger than we are and have substantially more employees and financial resources; changes in insurance reimbursement policies or application of them have resulted in decreased or delayed revenues.A large percentage of our revenues come from third-party payer reimbursement. Most of the third-party payers are large insurance companies with substantially more resources than we have. Upon delivery of our products to our patients, we directly bill the patients’ private insurance companies or government payers for reimbursement. If the third-party payers do not remit payment on a timely basis or if they change their policies to exclude or reduce coverage for our products, we would experience a decline in our revenue as well as cash flow. In addition, we may deliver products to patients and invoice based on past practices and billing experiences only to have third-party payers later deny coverage for such products.In some cases, our delivered product may not be covered pursuant to a policy statement of a third-party payer, despite a payment history with the third-party payer and benefits to the patients. A third-party payer may seek repayment of amounts previously paid for covered products. We maintain an allowance for provider discounts and amounts intended to cover legitimate requests for repayment. Failure to adequately identify and provide for amounts for resolution of repayment demands in our allowance for provider discounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For government healthcare programs, if we identify a deficiency in prior claims or practices, we may be required to repay amounts previously reimbursed to us by government healthcare programs, which could impact our reported revenues.We frequently receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request which can accumulate to a significant amount. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. During the adjudication process, we review claims where we are rebilling or pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests, we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid. Although we cannot predict whether or when a request for repayment or our subsequent request for reimbursement will be resolved, it is not unusual for such matters to be unresolved for an extended period of time. No assurances can be given with respect to our estimates for our allowance for provider discounts refund claim reimbursements and offsets or the ultimate outcome of the refund requests.We are dependent on our Medicare Supplier Number.We are required to have a Medicare Supplier Number in order to have the ability to bill Medicare for services provided to Medicare patients. Furthermore, all third-party and Medicaid contracts require us to have a Medicare Supplier Number. We are required to comply with Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) Supplier Standards in order to maintain such number. If we are unable to comply with the relevant standards, we could lose our Medicare Supplier Number. Without 11
Table of Contentssuch number, we would be unable to continue our various third-party and Medicaid contracts. A significant portion of our revenues are dependent upon our Medicare Supplier Number, the loss of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) requires that all Durable Medical Equipment providers must be accredited by a CMS-approved accreditation organization. On February 1, 2013, we initially received accreditation from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (“ACHC”), and we have remained accredited to date. If we lost our accredited status, our business, financial condition, revenues, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.We face periodic reviews and billing audits from governmental and private payers, and these audits could have adverse results that may negatively impact our business.As a result of our participation in the Medicaid program and our registration in the Medicare program, we are subject to various governmental reviews and audits to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs in which third-party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Private payers also reserve the right to conduct audits. If billing errors are identified in the sample of reviewed claims, the billing error can be extrapolated to all claims filed which could result in a larger overpayment than originally identified in the sample of reviewed claims. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews and audits may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review or audit could result in:●required refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid by governmental or private payers;●state or Federal agencies imposing fines, penalties, and other sanctions on us;●loss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payer networks; or●damage to our business and reputation in various markets.Any one of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Historically, we have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business or lost our right to participate in any government program or private payer networks related to reviews and audits. We are currently involved in a temporary payment suspension with Tricare. Cash collections from Tricare were $48.8 million and $38.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If the Company were to be required to repay all or any portion of the cash collections from 2024, 2023 or prior periods, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Failure to secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers could adversely affect acceptance of our products and reduce our revenues.The majority of our revenues come from third-party payers, primarily insurance companies.In the U.S., private payers cover the largest segment of the population, with the remainder either uninsured or covered by governmental payers. The majority of the third-party payers outside the U.S. are government agencies, government sponsored entities, or other payers operating under significant regulatory requirements from national or regional governments.Third-party payers may decline to cover and reimburse certain procedures, supplies, or services. Additionally, some third-party payers may decline to cover and reimburse our products for a particular patient even if the payer has a favorable coverage policy addressing our products or previously approved reimbursement for our products. Furthermore, private and government payers may consider the cost of a treatment in approving coverage or in setting reimbursement for the treatment.12
Table of ContentsPrivate and government payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of governments. Adoption of additional price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our revenues and operating results. If third-party payers do not consider our products or the combination of our products with additional treatments to be cost-justified under a required cost-testing model, they may not cover our products for their populations or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.Reimbursement for the treatment of patients with medical devices is governed by complex mechanisms. These mechanisms vary widely among countries, can be informal, somewhat unpredictable, and evolve constantly, reflecting the efforts of these countries to reduce public spending on healthcare. As a result, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement for the treatment of patients with medical devices has become more challenging. We cannot guarantee that the use of our products will receive reimbursement approvals and cannot guarantee that our existing reimbursement approvals will be maintained in any country.Our failure to secure or maintain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products by third-party payers in the U.S. or in the other jurisdictions in which we market our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.We are currently involved in a temporary payment suspension with Tricare. Cash collections from Tricare were $48.8 million and $38.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. If the Company were to be required to repay all or any portion of the cash collections from 2024, 2023 or prior periods, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.We may not be successful in maintaining the reimbursement codes necessary to facilitate accurate and timely billing for our products or physician services attendant to our products.Third-party payers, healthcare systems, government agencies, or other groups often issue reimbursement codes to facilitate billing for products and physician services used in the delivery of healthcare. If we are unable to maintain the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes (“HCPCS codes”) for physician services related to our products, our revenues and results may be affected by the absence of such HCPCS codes, as physicians may be less likely to prescribe the therapy when there is no certainty that adequate reimbursement will be available for the time, effort, skill, practice expense, and malpractice costs required to provide the therapy to patients.Outside the United States, we have not secured codes to describe our products or to document physician services related to the delivery of therapy using our products. The failure to obtain and maintain these codes could affect the growth of our business.Future changes in coverage and reimbursement policies for our products or reductions in reimbursement rates for our products by third party payers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.In the United States, our products are prescribed by physicians for their patients. Based on the prescription, which we consider an order, we submit a claim for payment directly to third-party payers such as private commercial insurance carriers, government payers, and others as appropriate, and the third-party payer reimburses us directly. Practices and policies around payment of the claims we submit can vary over time, which could impact our results of operations from quarter to quarter. Federal and state statutes, rules, or other regulatory measures that restrict coverage of our products or reimbursement rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell or rent our products or cause physical therapists and physicians to dispense and prescribe alternative, lower-cost products, which could negatively affect our revenues.There are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable, and provider discounts that we recognize, and if we are unable to accurately estimate these amounts, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and cash collections, which have a significant impact on our operating results, or lead to a restatement of our financial results.There are significant risks associated with the estimation of the amount of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable, and provider discounts that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of coverage, differing provider discount rates, and other third-party payer issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our customers at any point in time, together with 13
Table of Contentsthe changes in patient coverage that occur each month, require complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payers. Revenues associated with government programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payer that will ultimately be collectable from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds, and pay or retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after our products are provided. While we typically look to our past experience in collections with a payer in estimating amounts expected to be collected on current billings, recent trends and current changes in reimbursement practice, the overall healthcare environment, and other factors nonetheless could ultimately impact the amount of revenues recorded and the receivables collected. If our estimates of revenues, related refund liabilities, accounts receivable, or provider discounts are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results. It could also lead to a restatement of our financial results.Tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business. Changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results.We are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof. The most significant recent example of this is the impact of the U.S Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) which was enacted on December 22, 2017. These changes significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings, and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs, among other things. The Company has implemented the Tax Act and does not expect any significant changes related to the Tax Act at this time.The impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown but may harm our business.Our revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) made major changes in how healthcare is both delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.The PPACA, among other things, increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud and abuse laws, and encouraged the use of information technology. Such changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to our payer mix that may affect our operations and net revenue.Certain provisions of the PPACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services, and post-acute services for episodes of hospital care. Further, the PPACA may negatively impact payers by increasing medical costs generally, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payers seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas. The full impact of these changes on us cannot be determined at this time.We are also impacted by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, under which physicians must choose to participate in one of two payment formulas, Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”). Beginning in 2019, MIPS allows eligible physicians to receive upward or downward adjustments to their Medicare Part B payments based on certain quality and cost metrics, among other measures. As an alternative, physicians can choose to participate in an Advanced APM. Advanced APMs are exempt from the MIPS requirements, and physicians who are meaningful participants in APMs will receive bonus payments from Medicare pursuant to the law.In addition, current and prior healthcare reform proposals have included the concept of creating a single payer or public option for health insurance. If enacted, these proposals could have an extensive impact on the healthcare industry, including us. We are unable predict whether such reforms may be enacted or their impact on our operations.14
Table of ContentsWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payers will pay for healthcare services, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 has had an impact on our business, which may be in part beneficial and in part detrimental.In March 2010, broad federal healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States. This legislation did not become effective immediately in total and may be modified prior to the effective date of some provisions. This legislation has had an impact on our business in a variety of ways including increased number of Medicaid recipients, increased number of individuals with commercial insurance, additional audits conducted by public health insurance plans such as Medicaid and Medicare, changes to the rules that govern employer group health insurance, and other factors that influence the acquisition and use of health insurance from private and public payers. This legislation has resulted in a change in reimbursement for certain durable medical equipment. We believe the new healthcare legislation and these changes to reimbursement have caused uncertainty with prescribers, which we believe contributed to our drop in orders and revenue during 2013 and 2014 and the lack of any significant increase in 2015. Orders and revenue increased in 2016 through 2024; however, we are currently unable to determine whether such trend will continue in future periods or whether the healthcare reform legislation will have other adverse consequences to our business and results of operations. To the extent prescribers write fewer prescriptions for our products or there is an adverse change to insurance reimbursement for our products, due to the new law or otherwise, our revenue and profitability will be materially adversely affected.The uncertainty of continuing healthcare changes and regulations may negatively affect our business.There is some doubt on the continuation of the Affordable Care Act and the legislation that the current Congress will enact to replace it, if any. Because we cannot be certain about the continuation of the Affordable Care Act or any changes or replacements thereto, even if the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, there is also some doubt whether the President will support it or take regulatory action to negatively impact its benefits. The amount of uncertainty creates concern on our customers’ willingness to buy products which may or may not be covered by future healthcare benefits even if they are covered currently.We are subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years, and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.Our operations are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, and education programs.The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.The federal Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and, as applicable under state law, Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law, including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from 15
Table of Contentsstate to state. The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. The False Claims Act defines “knowingly” to include actual knowledge, acting in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of information, or acting in deliberate disregard of the truth or falsity of information. False Claims Act liability includes liability for reverse false claims for avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money to the government. This includes False Claims Act liability for failing to report and return overpayments within 60 days of the date on which the overpayment is “identified”. Penalties under the False Claims Act can include exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers”, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical, and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.For decades, the Company has constantly been and is involved in various private insurance and governmental audits, investigations, and reviews related to its operations. We are currently responding to investigative demands, subpoenas and formal document and records requests from various government organizations, including the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General, California Department of Insurance, and Colorado Attorney General. To date, we continue to cooperate with these requests and submit responsive documents. These investigations and requests can lead to government actions, resulting in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure, or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement, or Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”). If we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, becoming subject to these governmental investigations, audits, and reviews may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from the business as we cooperate with the government authorities, regardless of whether the particular investigation, audit, or review leads to the identification of underlying issues.We are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare reimbursement programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.Healthcare Fraud and Abuse​Our operations may be subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations including fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws and transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.​The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Law is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Law to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on, among other things, inappropriate consultant arrangements with physicians or questionable joint venture arrangements. The majority of states also 16
Table of Contentshave anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes.​Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the civil False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. In addition, off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their independent medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.​Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil, criminal and administrative penalties.​The Health Care Reform Law also included the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to disclose annually to CMS any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other licensed health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals. Such information is now made publicly available in a searchable format, and device manufacturers are now required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry, and some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare providers. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.​Our business operations may also be subject to certain federal and state laws regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.​To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.​The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, inform other agencies of ongoing or findings of investigations, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties 17
Table of Contentsagainst us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute.​If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe penalties including, for example, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and the results of our operations.​It is uncertain whether and how future legislation could affect prospects for our products or what actions federal, state or private payers for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation.​Claims made against us from time to time can result in litigation that could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand. As a company with expanding operations, we increasingly face the risk of litigation and other claims against us. We have no such claims at present. Litigation and other claims may arise in the ordinary course of our business and include employee claims, commercial disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented allegations and slip and fall claims. These claims can raise complex factual and legal issues that are subject to risks and uncertainties and could require significant management time. Litigation and other claims against us could result in unexpected expenses and liabilities, which could materially affect our operations and our reputation. In addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of various claims. Regardless of the outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or injunctive relief.​Litigation with customers, payers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.​In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions with customers, payers, employees and others. These actions may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury and product liability claims. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for breaches of contract or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management’s attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome, or could harm the Company’s reputation with customers, employees, investors and others.​Hospitals and clinicians may not buy, prescribe, or use our products in sufficient numbers, which could result in decreased revenues and profits.Hospitals and clinicians may not accept any of our products as effective, reliable, or cost-effective. Factors that could prevent such institutional patient acceptance include:●if patients conclude that the costs of these products exceed the cost savings associated with the use of these products;●if patients are financially unable to purchase these products;●if adverse patient events occur with the use of these products, generating adverse publicity;●if we lack adequate resources to provide sufficient education and training to our patients;●if frequent product malfunctions occur, leading clinicians to believe that the products are unreliable;18
Table of Contents●uncertainty regarding or change in government or third-party payer reimbursement policies for our products; and●if physicians or other health care providers believe that our products will not be reimbursed by insurers or decide to prescribe competing products.Because our sales are dependent on prescriptions from physicians, if any of these or other factors result in fewer prescriptions for our products being written, we will have reduced revenues and may not be able to fully fund our operations. Although we experienced an increase in orders for our ZMI products during 2024 and 2023 compared to prior years, we can make no assurances that demand for our products will not decline in future periods.Any new competitor could be larger than us and have greater financial and other resources than we do, and those advantages could make it difficult for us to compete with them.Many competitors to our products may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. Competition could result in fewer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our products are regulated by the FDA in the United States. Competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our FDA-cleared products, thereby using our products as predicate devices to more quickly obtain FDA approval for their own products. If overall demand for our products should decrease, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Substantial competition is expected in the future in the area of stroke rehabilitation that may directly compete with our NeuroMove product. These competitors may use standard or novel signal processing techniques to detect muscular movement and generate stimulation to such muscles. Other companies may develop rehabilitation products that perform better and/or are less expensive than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Failure to keep pace with the latest technological changes could result in decreased revenues.The market for some of our products is characterized by rapid change and technological improvements. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments could result in serious harm to our business and operating results. We have derived, and we expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from the development and sale of products in the medical device industry. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market product offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our competitors, evolving industry standards, and changing patient preferences. There is no assurance that we will keep up with technological improvements.Our business could be adversely affected by reliance on sole suppliers.Notwithstanding our current multiple supplier approach, certain essential product components may be supplied in the future by sole, or a limited group of, suppliers. Most of our products and components are purchased through purchase orders rather than through long-term supply agreements, and large volumes of inventory may not be maintained. There may be shortages and delays in obtaining certain product components. Disruption of the supply or inventory of components could result in a significant increase in the costs of these components or could result in an inability to meet the demand for our products. In addition, if a change in the manufacturer of a key component is required, qualification of a new supplier may result in delays and additional expenses in meeting customer demand for products. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and ability to retain our experienced sales force.A third-party manufacturer’s inability to produce our products’ components on time and to our specifications could result in lost revenue.Third-party manufacturers assemble and manufacture components of the NexWave and NeuroMove and some of our other products to our specifications. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our patients for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Because of the timing and seriousness of our business, and the medical device industry in particular, the dates on which patients need and require shipments of products from us are critical. Further, because quality is a leading factor when patients, doctors, health insurance providers, and distributors accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular patient.19
Table of ContentsWe could experience cost increases or disruptions in supply of raw materials or other components used in our products.Our third-party manufacturers that assemble and manufacture components for our products expect to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our product. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond our control, including market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, any delays or disruptions in our supply chain could harm our business. For example, COVID-19, including associated variants, could cause disruptions to and delays in our operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain parts, including semiconductors, materials and equipment necessary for the production of our products, and the internal designs and processes we or third-parties may adopt in an effort to remedy or mitigate impacts of such disruptions and delays could result in higher costs. In addition, our business also depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our products. We are exposed to multiple risks relating to availability and pricing of quality battery cells. These risks include:●the inability or unwillingness of battery cell manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of battery cells (including the applicable chemistries) required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;●disruption in the supply of battery cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and●an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of raw materials used in battery cells, such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt.Furthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs, or shortages in petroleum and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials or components would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins. We depend upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for our products. We do not have long-term agreements with our semiconductor chip manufacturers and suppliers, and if these manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply of semiconductor chips, with respect to which there is a global shortage, we would not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and our business would be adversely impacted.Semiconductor chips are a vital input component to the electrical architecture of our products, controlling wide aspects of the products’ operations. Many of the key semiconductor chips we use in our products come from limited or single sources of supply, and therefore a disruption with any one manufacturer or supplier in our supply chain would have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively manufacture and timely deliver our products. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with any suppliers and purchase chips on a purchase order basis. Due to our reliance on these semiconductor chips, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in their supply. We are in the process of identifying alternative manufacturers for semiconductor chips. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, semiconductor chip shortages, and the availability and cost of these components would be difficult to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems.In particular, increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for consumer electronics that use these chips, resulted in a severe global shortage of chips in 2021 and 2022. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips to be used in our products has been adversely affected. This shortage may result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of our products, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, and we are unable to mitigate the effects of this shortage, our ability to deliver sufficient quantities of our products to fulfill our preorders and to support our growth through sales to new customers would be adversely affected. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in managing ongoing chip shortages, including additional research and development expenses, engineering design, and development costs in the event that new suppliers must be onboarded on an expedited basis. Further, ongoing delays in production and shipment of products due to a continuing shortage of semiconductor chips may harm our reputation and discourage additional preorders and sales, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and operations.20
Table of ContentsIf we need to replace manufacturers, our expenses and cost of goods could increase, resulting in lower profit margins.We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers and import quota capacity. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have and thus have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot assure that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to existing terms, which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but we do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively. Should we be forced to replace one or more of our manufacturers, we may experience increased costs or an adverse operational impact due to delays in distribution and delivery of our products to our patients, which could cause us to lose patients or lose revenue because of late shipments.We are a relatively small company with a limited number of products and staff. Sales fluctuations and employee turnover may adversely affect our business.We are a relatively small company. Consequently, compared to larger companies, sales fluctuations could have a greater impact on our revenue and profitability on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis, and delays in patient orders could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. In addition, as a small company we have limited staff and are heavily reliant on certain key personnel to operate our business. If a key employee were to leave the company, it could have a material impact on our business and our results of operations, as we might not have sufficient depth in our staffing to fill the role that was previously being performed. A delay in filling the vacated position could put a strain on existing personnel, result in a failure to satisfy our contractual obligations, or to effectively implement our internal controls, which could materially harm our business.If we are unable to retain the services of Mr. Sandgaard or if we are unable to successfully recruit qualified managerial and sales personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations.Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Mr. Thomas Sandgaard, our Chief Executive Officer, Founder, and beneficial owner of approximately 50% of our outstanding stock as of February 28, 2025. Loss of the services of Mr. Sandgaard could have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business. There is currently no employment agreement with Mr. Sandgaard. We do not maintain key-man insurance on the life of Mr. Sandgaard. In addition, to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully retaining and recruiting qualified managerial and sales personnel. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. Various factors, such as marketability of our products, our reputation, our liquidity, and sales commission structure can affect our ability to find, attract, or retain sales personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract qualified new employees and sales representatives and retain existing employees and sales representatives.We need to maintain insurance coverage, which could become very expensive or have limited availability.Our marketing and sales of medical device products create an inherent risk of claims for product liability. As a result, we carry product liability insurance and will continue to maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate to protect us from claims. We cannot, however, be assured that we have resources sufficient to satisfy liability claims in excess of policy limits if required to do so. Also, if we are subject to such liability claims, there is no assurance that our insurance provider will continue to insure us at current levels or that our insurance rates will not substantially rise in the future, resulting in increased costs to us or forcing us to either pay higher premiums or reduce our coverage amounts, which would result in increased liability to claims.Although we do not manufacture the products we distribute, if one of the products distributed by us proves to be defective or is misused by a health care practitioner or patient, we may be subject to liability that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although we do not manufacture the products that we distribute, a defect in the design or manufacture of a product distributed or serviced by us, or a failure of a product distributed by us to perform for the use specified, could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise. Misuse of the product distributed by us by a practitioner or patient that results in injury could similarly subject us to liability. Any substantial underinsured loss could have a 21
Table of Contentsmaterial and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, any impairment of our reputation could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues and prospects for future business.We depend upon obtaining regulatory clearance of new products and/or manufacturing operations we develop and maintain clearances of current products; failure to obtain or maintain such regulatory clearances could result in increased costs, lost revenue, penalties, and fines.Before marketing certain new products, we will need to complete one or more clinical investigations of each product. There can be no assurance that the results of such clinical investigations will be favorable to us. We may not know the results of any study, favorable or unfavorable to us, until after the study has been completed. Such data must be submitted to the FDA as part of any regulatory filing seeking clearance to market the product. Even if the results are favorable, the FDA may dispute the claims of safety, efficacy, or clinical utility and not allow the product to be marketed. The sales price of the product may not be enough to recoup the amount of our investment in conducting the investigative studies, and we may expend significant funds on research and development on products that are rejected by the FDA. Some of our products are marketed based upon our interpretation of FDA regulation allowing for changes to an existing device. If our interpretations are incorrect, we could suffer consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and could result in fines and penalties. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources to complete development of any new products, complete the regulatory clearance process, or maintain regulatory compliance of existing products.We may not be able to obtain clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification or grant of a de novo classification request or approval of a pre-market approval application with respect to any products on a timely basis, if at all.If timely FDA clearance or approval of new products is not obtained, our business could be materially adversely affected. Clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification or de novo application may also be required before marketing certain previously marketed products, which have been modified after they have been cleared. Should the FDA so require, the filing of a new 510(k) pre-market notification for the modification of the product may be required prior to marketing any modified device. To determine whether adequate compliance has been achieved, the FDA may inspect our facilities at any time. Such compliance can be difficult and costly to achieve and maintain. Our compliance status may change due to future changes in, or interpretations of, FDA regulations or other regulatory agencies. Such changes may result in the FDA withdrawing marketing clearance or requiring or requesting product recall. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device or its intended use may require us to reassess compliance with good manufacturing practices guidelines, potentially interrupting the marketing and sale of products. We may also fail to comply with complex FDA regulations due to their complexity or otherwise. Failure to comply with regulations could result in enforceable actions, including product seizures, product recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals, injunctions, and civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation.Our products are subject to recall even after receiving FDA or foreign clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation and business.We are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or respective governmental authorities in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure you that we will not have product recalls in the future or that such recalls would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We have not undertaken any voluntary or mandatory recalls to date.We continue to incur expenses.This area of medical device research is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. Developments and advances in the medical industry by either competitors or other parties can affect our business in either a positive or negative manner. Developments 22
Table of Contentsand changes in technology that are favorable to us may significantly advance the potential of our research, while developments and advances in research methods outside of the methods we are using may severely hinder or completely halt our development.We are a small company in terms of employees and technical and research resources. We expect to incur research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These amounts may increase, and recently have in connection with our efforts to expand our sales force, before any commensurate incremental revenue from these efforts may be obtained and adversely affect our potential profits, and we may lack the liquidity to pay for such expenditures. These factors may also hinder our ability to meet changes in the medical industry as rapidly or effectively as competitors with more resources.Substantial costs could be incurred defending against claims of intellectual property infringement.Other companies, including competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary intellectual property rights that would limit, interfere with, or otherwise circumscribe our ability to make, use, or sell products. Should there be a successful claim of infringement against us, and if we could not license the alleged infringed technology at a reasonable cost, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. The validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Any litigation claims against us, independent of their validity, may result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources with no assurance of success. Intellectual property claims could cause us to:●cease selling, incorporating, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;●obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and●re-design our products excluding the infringed intellectual property, which may not be possible.We may be unable to protect our trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business.We consider our trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property an integral component of our success. We rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property. Effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available. We obtained utility patents on the fluid monitoring system in 2021 and 2018 in the U.S. and in 2020 in Europe. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property, especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, if our third-party confidentiality agreements are breached, there may not be an adequate remedy available to us. If our trade secrets become publicly known, we may lose competitive advantages.We may fail to protect the privacy, integrity and security of customer information.We possess and process sensitive customer information and Protected Health Information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (“HIPAA”). While we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, it could harm our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with healthcare privacy and consumer protection laws. A compromise of our privacy or security procedures could also subject us to liability under certain healthcare privacy laws applicable to us.Other federal and state laws restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable information are, in many cases, are not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies. These varying interpretations can create complex compliance issues for us and our partners and potentially expose us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identification, anonymization or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed and amended laws, regulations and industry 23
Table of Contentsstandards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amendments went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA creates specific obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information, and the CPRA amendments created a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA. Additionally, a similar law went into effect in Virginia on January 1, 2023, and further US-state comprehensive privacy laws are set to go into effect throughout 2023, including laws in Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah. These laws are substantially similar in scope and contain many of the same requirements and exceptions as the CCPA, including a general exemption for clinical trial data and limited obligations for entities regulated by HIPAA. However, we cannot yet determine the full impact these laws or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our current or future business. Any of these laws may broaden their scope in the future, and similar laws have been proposed on both a federal level and in more than half of the states in the U.S. A number of other states have proposed new privacy laws, some of which are similar to the above discussed recently passed laws. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance.Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.Increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks have resulted in an increase in information security risks in recent years. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack products and services and gain access to networks and data centers. In addition to extracting sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. The prevalent use of mobile devices also increases the risk of data security incidents. If we experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary and confidential information and may contain personal data of our customers. While we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect such data, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate such techniques or implement adequate preventative measures to avoid unauthorized access or other adverse impacts to such data or our systems. In addition, some of our third-party service providers and partners also collect and/or store our sensitive information and our customers’ data on our behalf, and these service providers and partners are subject to similar threats of cyber-attacks and other malicious internet-based activities, which could also expose us to risk of loss, litigation, and potential liability. A security breach could result in disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Specifically, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue and margins. Additionally, although we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage, we cannot be certain that such coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident, will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.We have identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, related to information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) that were not designed and operating effectively to IT 24
Table of Contentsprogram and data changes affecting the Company’s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. Also as of December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our communications with our independent auditors as it relates to open or pending financial statement adjustments and the timing of decisions to take write-offs. Although the material weaknesses identified above did not result in any material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented and there were no changes to previously released financial results, our management concluded that these control weakness constitute a material weakness and that our internal control was not effective as of December 31, 2024. Our management is committed to take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weakness described above.While we are committed to designing and implementing new controls and measures to remediate these material weaknesses, we cannot assure you that the measures will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses or avoid the identification of additional material weaknesses in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock.Expansion of our operations and sales internationally may subject us to additional risks, including risks associated with unexpected events.A component of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and sales internationally. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market, sell, and deliver our products in foreign markets, or that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations. Global operations could cause us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing risks, events, and circumstances.The following factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:●difficulties in managing foreign operations and attracting and retaining appropriate levels of senior management and staffing;●longer cash collection cycles;●proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences;●difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;●failure to properly comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities including, without limitation, product approval, healthcare and employment law requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;●fluctuations in exchange rates that may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of the products we provide in foreign markets;●the ability to efficiently repatriate cash to the United States and transfer cash between foreign jurisdictions; and●changes in general economic conditions or political circumstances in countries where we operate.Our acquisition of other companies could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.As part of our business strategy, we have made and may in the future acquire or make investments in other companies, solutions or technologies to, among other reasons, expand or enhance our product offerings. In the future, any significant acquisition would require 25
Table of Contentsthe consent of our lenders. Any failure to receive such consent could delay or prohibit us from acquiring companies that we believe could enhance our business.We may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals from our recent or any future acquisition, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, customers, partners or investors. In addition, if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenues and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. For example, in December 2021 we acquired Kestrel Labs, Inc. and we must effectively integrate the personnel, products, technologies and customers and develop and motivate new employees. In addition, we may not be able to successfully retain the customers and key personnel of such acquisitions over the longer term, which could also adversely affect our business. The integration of our recently acquired business or future-acquired business will require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired business and accurately forecast the financial impact of the acquisition, including accounting charges.We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc., we paid an approximate value of $30.5 million, consisting of $16.1 million in cash which was financed through Bank of America N.A. and approximately $14.4 million in shares of our common stock, a portion of which was to be held in escrow. To fund any future acquisition, we may issue equity, which would result in dilution to our stockholders, or incur more debt, which would result in increased fixed obligations and could subject us to additional covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.If we are not able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business could be harmed.Our inability to successfully integrate our recent and future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:●unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;●unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;●maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;●integrating the business cultures of both companies;●preserving important strategic client relationships;●consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and●coordinating geographically separate organizations.In addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. For example, the failure to get regulatory approval to sell certain products of an acquired business may significantly reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could harm our results of operations, even if we have put in place contingencies for the delivery of closing consideration, such as the escrowed shares initially held back in our acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc. Further, acquisitions may also cause us to:●issue securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership percentage;●use a substantial portion of our cash resources;26
Table of Contents●increase our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;●assume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners or have indemnification that may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners;●record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges;●experience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition liability estimates;●incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;●lose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;●incur large and immediate write-offs; or●become subject to litigation.Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.We are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the SEC. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require additional changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our reporting systems. Such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The conversion feature of our convertible senior notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.​We have outstanding a total of $60 million of convertible senior notes. See Note 8: Convertible Senior Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” If the conversion feature of any of those convertible senior notes is triggered, holders will be entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time during specified periods. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may be required, or may choose, to settle the obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKSales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Sandgaard, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stockSales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Sandgaard, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Mr. Sandgaard’s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.27
Table of ContentsOur existing stockholders may experience dilution if we elect to raise equity capitalPreviously, we’ve raised capital in the form of debt and/or equity to meet our working capital needs. We may also choose to issue equity or debt securities in the future to meet our liquidity or other needs which would result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we will attempt to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to do so. We may have to issue additional shares of our common stock at prices at a discount from the then-current market price of our common stock. If we raise additional working capital, existing stockholders may experience dilution.We paid a dividend on our common stock, and cash used to pay dividends will not be available for other corporate purposesIn 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.07 per share, which was paid in January 2019. In 2021, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per share, which was paid in January 2022. The decision to pay dividends in the future will depend on general business conditions, the impact of such payment on our financial condition, and other factors our Board of Directors may consider. If we elect to pay future dividends, this could reduce our cash reserves to levels that may be inadequate to fund expansions to our business plan or unanticipated contingent liabilities.Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.​Conversion of our 5% convertible senior notes into common stock may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.​If it were to occur, the conversion of our 5% convertible senior notes issued in May 2023 would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion of such notes. Any sales in the public market of such shares could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible senior notes and the anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.​ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.​ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY​Risk Management and StrategyWe recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.Managing Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk ManagementWe have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our management team works closely with our IT department to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. We have processes in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents. These include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity; and containment and incident response tools. We regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported that may affect our systems, and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk.28
Table of ContentsWe conduct periodic assessments and testing of our policies, standards, processes, and practices in a manner intended to address cybersecurity threats and events. The results of such assessments, audits, and reviews are evaluated by management, and we adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits, and reviews.We are establishing incident response, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans designed to more formally address our response to a cybersecurity incident.Oversee Third-party RiskBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We conduct basic security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards.

Table of ContentsITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSTravelers ​On August 23, 2023, Travelers Casualty Insurance Company of America and its affiliated entities (“Travelers”), on behalf of the People of the State of California, filed a complaint under seal in California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles against ZMI. The complaint, which was unsealed on December 16, 2024, alleged violations of the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (“IFPA”) for alleged false billing practices for claims submitted to Travelers in California. Travelers sought civil penalties and assessments on behalf of Travelers and the People of the State of California under the IFPA. ZMI disputed liability under the IFPA. Effective August 29, 2024, ZMI and Travelers entered into two settlement agreements for the collective amount of $1 million to resolve the claims asserted by Travelers in the IFPA action and for threatened claims for bills submitted to Travelers outside California. In addition to obtaining a broad release of liability from Travelers and avoiding the substantial cost of further litigation, the settlement agreements also provide a billing protocol for all future claims submitted to Travelers. At the time of the settlement agreements, the Company could not estimate the likelihood of a particular outcome or probable cost resulting from the action because the State of California had not intervened in the action, participated in settlement discussions, or consented to settlement or dismissal. On or about November 4, 2024, Travelers informed ZMI the State of California would not object to settlement and dismissal. On December 13, 2024, the action was dismissed with prejudice and the settlement payment was made to Travelers on December 19, 2024. ​Other Legal Proceedings ​We are not a party to any other material pending legal proceedings.​ITEM 4.

Table of ContentsITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe information and financial data discussed below is derived from our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023. The consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and was prepared to provide a historical and narrative discussion of our financial condition and results of operations through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes of the Company contained elsewhere in this Report. The consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Report fully represent the Company’s financial condition and operations; however, they are not indicative of the Company’s future performance. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements” above for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report.OVERVIEWWe operate in one primary business segment, electrotherapy and pain management products. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s only active subsidiaries are ZMI, a wholly-owned Colorado corporation, through which the Company conducts its U.S. electrotherapy and pain management operations, and ZMS. ZMS, a wholly-owned Colorado corporation, has developed a fluid monitoring system, which has received two utility patents and FDA approval in the U.S. ZMS also acquired Kestrel during 2021, which had two pulse-oximeter products they are developing and numerous patents. However, ZMS has achieved no revenues to date. The following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained in this Annual Report.HIGHLIGHTSDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company achieved the following:●Achieved a 16% increase in device orders, 4% growth in revenue, and operating cash flows of $12.7 million; ●Recorded net income of $3.0 million and our 9th consecutive profitable year;●Achieved higher sales representative productivity with increased revenue per sales representative;●Due to strong results and related cash flow, we repurchased approximately $15.6 million worth of the Company’s common stock; ●Recognized as a “Best Company to Work For” by U.S. News & World Report and Top Workplaces●Ranked 9rd in the Top 25 Medical Device Companies for 2024 according to The Healthcare Technology Report;●Completed multiple IRB-approved clinical studies including multiple blood donation studies for detection of minor blood loss in healthy adult subjects; and●Completed a hypoxemia study at the University of California, San Francisco and Calibration and Verification enrollments of a multi-analyte human trial at Duke University for NiCO as well as various Q-Submissions and meetings with the FDA.RECENT EVENTSWe were recently notified that TriCare, one of our government payers, was temporarily suspending payments as they review prior claims. We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.   TriCare currently represents approximately 20-25% of our annual revenue. As directed by Tricare, we continue to support both existing patients and new patients as we receive their prescriptions. 33
Table of ContentsDue to the temporary payment suspension and lack of clarity on the timing of a resolution, we are restructuring our staff to align with current revenue. We are decreasing our overall staff by approximately 10%, which primarily affects employees in our corporate departments. This staff reduction along with other expense reductions made during the second half of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 will result in savings of approximately $35 million annually. Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately.  We are confident that long-term, our pain management business is still solid with significant growth potential.​INFLATION REDUCTION ACT On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, (i) directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law; (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize drug price increases that outpace inflation; and (iii) redesigns the Medicare Part D program, increasing manufacturer rebates within the catastrophic coverage phase. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions began to take effect progressively beginning in fiscal year 2023, although they have been subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.The IRA also includes various tax provisions, including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1 billion. The Company does not expect these tax provisions to materially impact its financial statements.SUMMARYNet revenue increased 4% in 2024 to $192.4 million from $184.3 million in 2023. Net income was $3.0 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased 28%, or $5.0 million, to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net cash flows from operations along with our current cash position allowed us to repurchase $15.6 million of common stock and maintain working capital of $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. 34

The reserve for billing allowance adjustments and allowance for uncollectible accounts are adjusted on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the processing of third-party payer insurance claims and other customer collection history. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised as additional information becomes available and constraints are released. If initial estimates are updated these changes are accounted for as increases or decreases in the transaction price. Assuming the underlying performance obligation to which the change in price relates has already been satisfied, those changes in transaction price are immediately recognized as increases or decreases in revenue (not credit losses (bad debt expense)) in the period in which the estimate changes.Product device revenue is primarily comprised of sales and rentals of our electrotherapy products and also includes private labeled rehabilitation products such as our cervical traction, lumbar support, bracing, and hot/cold therapy products. Supplies revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our consumable supplies to patients using our electrotherapy products, consisting primarily of surface electrodes and batteries. Revenue related to both devices and supplies is reported net, after adjustments for estimated third-party payer reimbursement deductions and estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. The deductions are known throughout the healthcare industry as billing adjustments whereby the healthcare insurers unilaterally reduce the amount they reimburse for our products as compared to the sales prices charged by us. The deductions from gross revenue also take into account the estimated denials, net of resubmitted billings of claims for products placed with patients which may affect collectability. See our 36
Table of ContentsSignificant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete explanation of our revenue recognition policies.We occasionally receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. We also review claims that have been resubmitted or where we are pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid. Net revenue increased $8.0 million or 4% to $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $184.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The growth in net revenue is primarily related to the 16% growth in device orders which led to an increased customer base and drove higher sales of consumable supplies. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company placed an allowance of $6.2 million on receivables which were determined to be uncollectible. The allowance was recorded to net revenue during the period.Device RevenueDevice revenue is related to the purchase or lease of our electrotherapy products as well as complementary products including cervical traction, lumbar support, knee braces and hot/cold therapy products. Device revenue increased $0.8 million or 1% to $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in device revenue is related to the growth in our device and complementary product orders of 16% from 2023 to 2024 as a result of increased sales representative productivity.Supplies RevenueSupplies revenue is related to the sale of supplies, typically electrodes and batteries, for our products. Supplies revenue increased $7.2 million or 6% to $132.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in supplies revenue is primarily related to growth in our customer base from higher device sales in 2024 and prior years. Operating ExpensesCosts of Revenue –Devices and SuppliesCosts of revenue – devices and supplies consist primarily of device and supplies costs, operations labor and overhead, shipping and depreciation. Costs of revenue increased $1.1 million or 3% to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in costs of revenue is directly related to the increase in device and supplies orders, partially offset by the items noted below. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue – devices and supplies decreased to 20% from 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue – device and supply as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 is due to the increased volumes related to increased revenue and expanding supplier portfolio mix. Both of which have allowed us to negotiate lower costs with our suppliers.Sales and Marketing ExpenseSales and marketing expense primarily consists of employee-related costs, including sales commissions and other direct costs associated with these personnel including travel and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $0.1 million to $86.6 million from $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force, partially offset by higher commissions from increased orders. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased to 45% from 47% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared the same period in 2023. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in expenses, and increased revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024.37
Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative ExpenseGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of employee related costs, facilities expense, professional fees and depreciation and amortization. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 24% to $60.4 million from $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to the following:●an increase of $3.5 million in compensation and benefits expense driven by headcount growth in our ZMI reimbursement team, and an increase in subcontractor expense of $0.9 million, both of which are related to our 16% order growth during the period;●an increase of $1.1 million in compensation and benefits expense driven by headcount growth and inflationary salary increases at ZMS, and an increase of $1.1 million for subcontractor expense related to new product development at ZMS; and●an increase of $5.2 million in other expenses, including professional fees of $3.8 million, and other general and administrative costs of $1.4 million associated primarily with growth of the Company and order volume.As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 26% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the aforementioned increase in expenses, partially offset by increased revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. Other Income (Expense)Other expense was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily related to interest expense of $2.4 million on our Senior Convertible Notes, net of interest earned. Other income was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $2.9 million related to a gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration offset by $1.1 million in interest expense related to our Senior Convertible Notes, net of interest earned.Income Tax ExpenseWe recorded income tax expense of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 17% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $58.3 million, compared to $69.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The principal source of working capital was $39.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $18.0 million in accounts receivable. The decrease in working capital is driven from the purchase of $15.6 million in treasury stock in 2024 partially offset by net income of $3.0 million. We generated $12.7 million and $17.8 million in operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations, debt and equity transactions. As of December 31, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was $39.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $18.0 million in accounts receivables, and our working capital balance was $58.3 million. In May 2023, the Company issued $52.5 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2026 (the “2023 Convertible Senior Notes”). In May 2023, the Company issued an additional $7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes upon the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option. Interest on the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, beginning November 15, 2023. The 2023 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and are redeemable at the option of the Company on or after May 20, 2025 (See Note 8).38
Table of ContentsOur anticipated uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $12.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to lower profitability and a decrease in accounts payable, slightly offset by an increase in inventory balances. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash collections related to net income of $9.7 million, offset by increased inventory balances.Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of computer, office and warehouse equipment, and ongoing capital projects for ZMS operations. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the purchase of computer, office and warehouse equipment.Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $17.1 million. The cash used in financing activities of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of $15.6 million in treasury stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $7.6 million. The cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Convertible Notes of $57.0 million, offset by purchases of $37.9 million in treasury stock and principal payments made on long term debt totaling $10.7 million.We believe our cash, together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. In making this assessment, we considered the following:●our cash balance at December 31, 2024 of $39.6 million;●our working capital balance of $58.3 million;●our accounts receivable balance of $18.0 million;●our profitability over the last 9 years; and●our planned capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 million during 2025.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes the future cash disbursements to which we are contractually committed as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands).​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    Total    2025    2026    2027    2028    2029    ThereafterOperating leases ​ 15,469 ​ 4,632 ​ 4,428 ​ 4,237 ​ 2,172 ​ — ​ —Finance leases ​ 1,204 ​ 336 ​ 312 ​ 264 ​ 171 ​ 121 ​ —​​$ 16,673​$ 4,968​$ 4,740​$ 4,501​$ 2,343​$ 121​$ —​We lease office and warehouse facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. The current office facility leases include our current and former corporate headquarters and a production warehouse, all located in Englewood, Colorado and a lease in Boulder, Colorado for the operations of ZMS Boulder. Rent expense was $3.5 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A portion of the rent expense was non-cash in nature as we received rent abatements during both years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023. For GAAP purposes, the rent is expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company also leases office equipment for its corporate and warehouse facilities under non-cancelable finance lease agreements. 39
Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and disclosure of contingent liabilities that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about these critical accounting policies, as well as a description our other accounting policies.Revenue Recognition and Accounts ReceivableRevenue is generated primarily from sales and leases of our electrotherapy devices and related supplies and complementary products. Sales are primarily made with, and shipped, direct to the patient with a small amount of revenue generated from sales to distributors.In the healthcare industry there is often a third party involved that will pay on the patients’ behalf for purchased or leased devices and supplies. The terms of the separate arrangement impact certain aspects of the contract with patients covered by third party payers, such as contract type and transaction price, but for purposes of revenue recognition the contract with the customer refers to the arrangement between the Company and the patient.The Company does not have any material deferred revenue in the normal course of business as each performance obligation is met upon delivery of goods to the patient.Device SalesDevice sales can be in the form of a purchase or a lease.Revenue for purchased devices is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 – “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASC 606) when the device is delivered to the patient and all performance obligations are fulfilled.Revenue related to devices out on lease is recognized in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. Using the guidance in ASC 842, we concluded our transactions should be accounted for as operating leases based on the following criteria below:●The lease does not transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.●The lease does not grant the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.●The lease term is month to month, which does not meet the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. However, if the commencement date falls at or near the end of the economic life of the underlying asset, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.●There is no residual value guaranteed and the present value of the sum of the lease payments does not equal or exceed substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.●The underlying asset is expected to have alternative uses to the lessor at the end of the lease term.Lease commencement occurs upon delivery of the device to the patient. The Company retains title to the leased device and those devices are classified as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Since our leases are month-to-month and can be returned by the patient at any time, revenue is recognized monthly for the duration of the period in which the patient retains the device.40
Table of ContentsSuppliesSupplies revenue is recognized once supplies are delivered to the patient. Supplies needed for the device can be set up as a recurring shipment or ordered through the customer support team or online store as needed.Variable ConsiderationA significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived, and the related receivables are due, from patients with commercial or government health insurance plans. Revenues are estimated using the portfolio approach by third party payer type based upon historical rates of collection, the aging of receivables, trends in the historical reimbursement rates by third-party payer types and current relationships and experience with the third-party payers, which includes estimated constraints for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, allowance for uncollectible accounts, and billing allowance adjustments. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised as additional information becomes available and constraints are released. If initial estimates are updated these changes are accounted for as increases or decreases in the transaction price. Assuming the underlying performance obligation to which the change in price relates has already been satisfied, those changes in transaction price are immediately recognized as increases or decreases in revenue (not credit losses (bad debt expense)) in the period in which the estimate changes.
Additionally, the complexity of third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain products from third-party payers or unanticipated requirements to refund payments previously received may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party payer reimbursement, it is possible our forecasting model to estimate collections could change, which could have an impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Any differences between estimated settlements and final determinations are reflected as an increase or a reduction in revenue in the period when such final determinations are known. Historically these differences have been immaterial, and the Company has not had to go back and reassess the adjustments of future periods for past billing adjustments.The Company monitors the variability and uncertain timing over third-party payer types in our portfolios. If there is a change in our third-party payer mix over time, it could affect our net revenue and related receivables. We believe we have a sufficient history of collection experience to estimate the net collectible amounts by third-party payer type. However, changes to constraints related to billing adjustments and refund requests have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net revenue as a percentage of gross revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 11% and 12%, respectively. We collected 94% of our December 31, 2023 accounts receivable balance during 2024 and 98% through April 30, 2025.During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a change in the estimate of uncollectable receivables. An allowance was placed on a group of older receivables from a single payer. We continue to work with this payer and current collections are in line with expectations. The result of this change in allowance was a reduction of $6.2 million to net revenue ($4.6 million net of tax) or $0.14 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $0.13 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2023. Stock-based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation through recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, which is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The stock-based compensation expenses are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the requisite service period, which in the Company’s case is the same as the vesting period). For awards subject to the achievement of performance metrics, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income projections, historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. However, adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded. Such adjustments, if any, could have a material impact on our results of our operations.41
Table of ContentsWe use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into law on August 16, 2022. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income during the most recently completed three-year period exceeds $1 billion. This provision is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows or financial position during the year ended December 31, 2024.Acquisition Method of Accounting for Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill. We engage independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuation require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Different valuations approaches are used to value different types of intangible assets. Under the income approach, the relief from royalty method is a valuation technique which is used to estimate the value of certain intangible assets. This method utilizes projected financial information and hypothetical royalty rates to estimate the cost savings associated with asset ownership. The estimated cost savings are discounted for risk and the time value of money to estimate an intangible asset’s fair value. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion or all of our intangible assets, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment.Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Including GoodwillWe assess impairment of goodwill annually and other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicates that their carrying value amount may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net and goodwill and intangible assets. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: (i) significant decreases in the market price of the asset; (ii) significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors; (iii) or expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.Contingent ConsiderationsWe classified contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions within Level 3 as factors used to develop the estimated fair value were unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity. We estimated the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo simulation which is based on equity volatility, the risk-free rate, the normal variate, projected milestone dates, discount rates, and probabilities of payment.​ITEM 7A.

Table of ContentsITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2024. Based on management’s review, with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the quarter ended December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s report on internal control over financial reportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based upon the framework in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based upon this evaluation and the material weakness identified below, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024.Material Weakness in Internal ControlWe identified a material weakness related to Information Technology General Controls (“ITGCs”) that were not designed and operating effectively to ensure IT program and data changes affecting the Company’s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We also identified a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness around the valuation of certain accounts receivables.The material weaknesses identified above did not result in any material misstatements in our financial statements or disclosures, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Our management concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Marcum LLP as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Remediation PlanOur management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness above, management will take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weakness described above.43
Table of ContentsChanges in Internal Control over Financial ReportingExcept for the items referred to above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal ControlOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed in “Part II. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not design and maintain effective controls over the valuation of certain accounts receivable. ​In 2024, we completed the redesign of the failed controls over the valuation of certain accounts receivable and performed the necessary design walkthroughs and testing. We concluded the redesigned control was designed and operated as intended for the year ended December 31, 2024.ITEM 9B.

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting​To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Zynex, Inc. ​Adverse Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting​We have audited Zynex, Inc.’s (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.​A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in “Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”:​IT General Controls (“ITGC”), deficiencies were identified​It was determined that as of December 31, 2024, the Company's primary change management controls were not designed and implemented effectively to ensure IT program and data changes affecting the Company’s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate . Other Information Technology General Controls, automated process-level controls, and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.​This  material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal December 31, 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 11, 2025 on those financial statements.​We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and  the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) for the year ended December 31, 2024 of the Company, and our report dated March, 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. ​Basis for Opinion​The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting". Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.​We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.​F-1
Table of ContentsDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting​A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.​Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.​​​/s/ Marcum LLP​Marcum LLP​We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.​New York, NYMarch 11, 2025​​F-2
Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm​To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Zynex, Inc. ​Opinion on the Financial Statements​We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zynex, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.​We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on
the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated March 11, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of material weaknesses.​Basis for Opinion​These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.​We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.​Critical Audit Matters ​The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.​Estimation of Transaction Price and Variable Consideration for Revenue Recognition including related Valuation of Accounts Receivable ​Critical Audit Matter Description ​The Company’s revenue is derived from sales and leases of electrotherapy devices and sales of related supplies and complementary products. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the product has been transferred to the patient, in the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive. The Company estimates revenues using the portfolio approach based upon historical rates of collection, aging of receivables, product mix, trends in historical reimbursement rates by third-party payer types, and current F-3
Table of Contentsrelationships and experience with the third-party payers, which includes estimated variable consideration and relevant constraints for third-party payer refund requests, deductions and adjustments.​We identified the Company's estimation of transaction price related to variable consideration for revenue recognition, including the related valuation of accounts receivable, as a critical audit matter. Auditing the Company's determination of variable consideration and the related constraint for revenue recognition including the recorded value for accounts receivable was challenging and complex due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in evaluating management’s estimates. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort to audit and evaluate management’s key judgments.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit​Our audit procedures related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable include the following, among others:●We gained an understanding of the design of the controls over the Company's revenue recognition and valuation of accounts receivable including those controls over the processes to develop key management estimates.●We performed testing throughout the year on a sample basis  to test the validity of sales transactions and cash receipts application. ●We evaluated the significant assumptions and the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management’s calculations, including evaluating management’s estimate of historical reimbursement experience as well as expected future payment behavior through a combination of underlying data validation by inspection of source documents, independent recalculation of management’s analysis, review of correspondence with third-party payers, inquiries with management and evaluation of trends in collection rates and refund requests.​​/s/ Marcum LLP​Marcum LLP​We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022​New York, NY March 11, 2025​​F-4

Table of ContentsZYNEX, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023(1)   ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF BUSINESSOrganizationZynex, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) has its headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. The term “the Company” refers to Zynex, Inc. and its active and inactive subsidiaries. The Company operates in one primary business segment, medical devices which include electrotherapy and pain management products. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s only active subsidiaries are Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) through which the Company conducts most of its operations, and Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation). ZMS has developed a fluid monitoring system which received initial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) during 2020 and is pursuing CE Marking in Europe. ZMS has achieved no revenues to date. The Company’s inactive subsidiaries include Kestrel Labs, Inc. (“Kestrel,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation), Zynex Europe, Zynex NeuroDiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy”, a wholly-owned Colorado Corporation), which was incorporated in June 2015. The Company’s compounding pharmacy operated as a division of ZMI dba as Pharmazy through January 2016.In December 2021, the Company acquired 100% of Kestrel Labs, Inc. (“Kestrel”), a laser-based, noninvasive patient monitoring technology company. Kestrel’s laser-based products include the NiCO™ CO-Oximeter, a multi-parameter pulse oximeter, and HemeOx™, a total hemoglobin oximeter that enables continuous arterial blood monitoring. Both NiCO and HemeOx are yet to be presented to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for market clearance. All activities related to Kestrel flow through our ZMS subsidiary.Nature of BusinessThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. The Company’s devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All the Company’s medical devices are designed to be patient friendly and designed for home use. The devices are small, portable, battery operated, and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. All of the medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to FDA regulation and approval. All of the products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. The Company’s primary product is the NexWave device. The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by the Company’s field sales representatives. The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed. The Company also distributes private labeled complementary rehabilitation products such as back, knee and wrist braces, cervical and lumbar traction, and hot/cold therapy (“Private Labeled Rehabilitation Products”).During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated all of its revenue in North America from sales and supplies of its devices to patients and healthcare providers.(2)   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zynex, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesPreparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and F-9
Table of Contentsdisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant management estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are associated with the expected net collectable value of its accounts receivable and related revenue, inventory reserves, the life of its leased unit devices, stock-based compensation, valuation of long-lived assets acquired in business combinations, valuation of contingent consideration, and realizability of deferred tax assets.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The Company measures its long-term debt at fair value which approximates book value as the long-term debt bears market rates of interest.The Company classified contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions within Level 3 as factors used to develop the estimated fair value were unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity. The Company estimated the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo simulation. Changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities in subsequent periods were recorded as a gain or (loss) in the statements of income.Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term InvestmentsCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company classifies investments with maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments. Short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investments until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost. Due to the short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet approximate fair value.Accounts Receivable, NetThe Company’s accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and are generated when a patient receives one of the Company’s devices, related supplies, or private labeled rehabilitation products. In conjunction with fulfilling the Company’s obligation to deliver a product, the Company invoices the patient’s third-party payer and/or the patient. Billing adjustments represent the difference between the list price and the reimbursement rates set by third-party payers, including Medicare, commercial payers, and amounts billed directly to the patient. Specific amounts, if uncollected over a period of time, may be written-off after several appeals, which in some cases may take longer than twelve months. Primarily all of the Company’s receivables are due from patients with commercial or government health plans and worker’s compensation claims with a smaller portion related to private pay individuals, attorney, and auto claims. The Company maintains a constraint for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, and adjustments. See Note 15 – Concentrations for discussion of significant customer accounts receivable balances.Inventory, NetInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard costs, which approximates actual costs on an average cost basis. Following are the components of inventory as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:​​​​​​​​​    2024    2023Raw materials​$ 5,525​$ 4,601Work-in-process​  143​  530Finished goods​​ 7,085​​ 6,929Inventory in transit​  1,320​  1,346​​$ 14,073​$ 13,406Less: reserve​​ (154)​​ (300)​​$ 13,919​$ 13,106​The Company monitors inventory for turnover and obsolescence and records losses for excess and obsolete inventory, as appropriate. The Company provides reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories F-10
Table of Contentson hand and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. If future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Long-lived AssetsThe Company records intangible assets based on estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment and intangible assets. The finite-lived intangible assets are patents and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the assets. The Company assesses impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to: (i) significant decreases in the market price of the asset; (ii) significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors; or (iii) expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. Useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets by each asset category are summarized below:​​​​​​Estimated​​Useful Lives​    in yearsPatents  11​Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. We compute depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:​​​​Classification    Estimated Useful LifeOffice furniture and equipment 5 to 7 yearsAssembly equipment 7 yearsVehicles 5 yearsLeasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or term of leaseLeased devices 9 months​LeasesThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception or modification of a contract.The Company recognizes finance and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. For our finance leases, the Company uses the implicit rate to determine the present value of future lease payments. For our operating leases that do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company includes options to extend or terminate a lease in the lease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise such options. The Company recognizes leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as lease expense over the lease term, and those leases are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on our leases where the Company is the lessee, see Note 12 - Leases.A significant portion of our device revenue is derived from patients who obtain our devices under month-to-month lease arrangements where the Company is the lessor. Revenue related to devices on lease is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). Using the guidance in ASC 842, we concluded our transactions should be accounted for as operating leases based on the following criteria:●The lease does not transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term. ●The lease does not grant the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. F-11
Table of Contents●The lease term is month to month, which does not meet the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. However, if the commencement date falls at or near the end of the economic life of the underlying asset, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. ●There is no residual value guaranteed and the present value of the sum of the lease payments does not equal or exceed substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.●The underlying asset is expected to have alternative uses to the lessor at the end of the lease term. Lease commencement occurs upon delivery of the device to the patient. The Company retains title to the leased device and those devices are classified as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Since our leases are month-to-month and can be returned by the patient at any time, revenue is recognized monthly for the duration of the period in which the patient retains the device. Revenue RecognitionRevenue is derived from sales and leases of the Company’s electrotherapy devices and sales of related supplies and complementary products. Device sales can be in the form of a purchase or a lease. Supplies needed for the device can be set up as a recurring shipment or ordered through the customer support team or online store as needed. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the product has been transferred to the patient, in the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive. In general, revenue from sales of devices and supplies is recognized once the product is delivered to the patient, which is when control is deemed to have transferred to the patient.Sales of devices and supplies are primarily shipped directly to the patient, with a small amount of revenue generated from sales to distributors. In the healthcare industry, there is often a third party involved that will pay on the patients’ behalf for purchased or leased devices and supplies. The terms of the separate arrangement impact certain aspects of the contracts, with patients covered by third party payers, such as contract type and transaction price. For purposes of revenue recognition, the contract with the customer refers to the arrangement between the Company and the patient. The Company does not have any material deferred revenue in the normal course of business as each performance obligation is met upon delivery of goods to the patient. There are no substantial costs incurred through support or warranty obligations.The following table provides a breakdown of net revenue related to devices accounted for as purchases subject to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 – “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) and leases subject to ASC 842 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​For the Years Ended December 31, ​    2024    2023Device revenue​​   ​  Purchased​$ 28,770​$ 23,971Leased​  30,842​  34,851Total device revenue​$ 59,612​$ 58,822Supplies revenue​​ 132,742​​ 125,500Total revenue​$ 192,354​$ 184,322​Revenues are estimated using the portfolio approach by third-party payer type based upon historical rates of collection, aging of receivables, trends in historical reimbursement rates by third-party payer types, and current relationships and experience with the third-party payers, which includes estimated constraints for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, allowance for uncollectible accounts and billing allowance adjustments. Inherent in these estimates is the risk they will have to be revised as additional information becomes available and constraints are released. If initial estimates are updated these changes are accounted for as increases or decreases in the transaction price. Assuming the underlying performance obligation to which the change in price relates has already been satisfied, those changes in transaction price are immediately recognized as increases or decreases in revenue (not credit losses (bad debt expense)) in the period in which the estimate changes. Additionally, the complexity of third-party payer billing arrangements, the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain products from third-party payers, or unanticipated requirements to refund payments previously received may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Settlements with third-party payers for F-12
Table of Contentsretroactive revenue adjustments due to audits, reviews, or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price using the expected amount method. These adjustments to transaction price are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payer, correspondence from the payer, and historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolved. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party payer reimbursement, it is possible the Company’s forecasting model to estimate collections could change, which could have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Any differences between estimated and actual collectability are reflected in the period in which payment is received. The Company monitors the variability and uncertain timing over third-party payer types in the portfolio. If there is a change in the Company’s third-party payer mix over time, it could affect net revenue and related receivables. The Company believes it has a sufficient history of collection experience to estimate the net collectible amounts by third-party payer type. However, changes to constraints related to billing adjustments and refund requests have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.GoodwillGoodwill is recorded as the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to impairment testing. The Company tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. The Company tests more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. These indicators include, among others, declines in sales, earnings, cash flows, or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The estimates of fair value and the determination of reporting units requires management judgment. Debt Issuance CostsDebt issuance costs are costs incurred to obtain new debt financing. Debt issuance costs are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method.Advertising and Marketing CostsAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs are included in Sales and marketing expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.Segment InformationThe Company currently operates business as one operating segment which includes two revenue types: Devices and Supplies. While the Company discloses device and supply revenue separately, management does not consider these to be separate segments, as they are sold through the same sales channel, and supplies are contingent upon device orders. Management’s analysis and determination for allocation of resources is not analyzed or broken out by revenue streams, but as one reporting unit. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The Company’s CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer who review and evaluate consolidated net income for purposes of assessing performance, making operating decisions, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting for future periods. For financial information related to the Company’s one segment, see the consolidated financial statements and related notes herein.Stock-based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation through recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, which is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The stock-based compensation expenses are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to F-13
Table of Contentsprovide service in exchange for the award (the requisite service period, which in the Company’s case is the same as the vesting period). For awards subject to the achievement of performance metrics, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.Earnings Per ShareThe Company calculates basic earnings per share on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period plus the effect of potential dilutive common shares during the period using the treasury stock method and if-converted method. Potential shares of common stock outstanding include unvested restricted stock awards, vested and unvested unexercised stock options, common stock purchase warrants, and convertible notes.Research and DevelopmentResearch and Development costs are expensed when incurred. During 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately $12.0 million and $9.2 million in operating expenses, respectively, related to our ZMS operations. During 2024 and 2023, approximately $9.2 million and $7.7 million of the expenses, respectively, required capitalization under Section 174 - “Amortization of Research and Experimental Expenditures” tax treatment.Income TaxesThe Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted into law on August 16, 2022. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income during the most recently completed three-year period exceeds $1 billion. This provision is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows, or financial position during the period ended December 31, 2024.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU (“Accounting Standards Update”) 2023-06, “Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative” (“ASU 2023-06”). This ASU incorporates certain SEC disclosure requirements into the FASB ASC. The amendments in the ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of ASC Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the ASC with the SEC’s regulations. The ASU has an unusual effective date and transition requirements since it is contingent on future SEC rule setting. If the SEC fails to enact required changes by June 30, 2027, this ASU is not effective for any entities. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) to update reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This update is effective beginning with the Company’s 2024 fiscal year annual reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.F-14
Table of ContentsIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”) to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. This ASU applies to all entities subject to income taxes. This ASU will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 “Codification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements.” This amendment to the Codification removes references to various Concept Statements. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early application of the amendments in this update is permitted for all entities, for any fiscal year or interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.Management does not believe that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.​​(3)   BUSINESS COMBINATIONSOn December 22, 2021, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc., entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Kestrel and each of the shareholders of Kestrel (collectively, the “Selling Shareholders”). Under the Agreement, the Selling Shareholders agreed to sell all of the outstanding common stock of Kestrel (the “Kestrel Shares”) to the Company. The consideration for the Kestrel Shares consisted of $16.1 million cash and 1,467,785 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Zynex Shares”). All of the Zynex Shares were subject to a lock-up agreement for a period of one year from the closing date under the Agreement (the “Closing Date”). The Agreement provides the Selling Shareholders with piggyback registration rights. 978,524 of the Zynex Shares were deposited in escrow (the “Escrow Shares”). The number of Escrow Shares were subject to adjustment on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or in connection with any Liquidation Event (as defined in the Agreement) that occurs prior to such anniversary date) based on the number of shares equal to $10.0 million divided by a 30-day volume weighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock. The Escrow Shares were adjusted on the anniversary date, which resulted in the cancellation of 156,673 Escrow Shares. Half of the Escrow Shares were to be released on submission of a dossier on a laser-based photoplethysmographic device (the “Device”) to the FDA for permission to market and sell the Device in the United States. The other half of the Escrow Shares were to be released upon determination by the FDA that the Device can be marketed and sold in the United States.On July 27, 2023, the Company, ZMS, Kestrel, and the Selling Shareholders, entered into an amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”). The parties entered into the Amendment to modify certain terms of the Agreement related to the conditions to be satisfied for the release of the Escrow Shares to the Selling Shareholders. The Escrow Shares were released from escrow, and simultaneously, the selling stockholders entered into a lock-up agreement. The lock-up agreement includes two lock-up periods which release certain restrictions on the Selling Shareholders on December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. These shares are included in the Company’s calculation of basic earnings per share. The acquisition of Kestrel has been accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805 – “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Under ASC 805, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination must be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.​F-15

(the “Bank”) in December 2021. Under this Loan Agreement, the Bank extended two facilities to the Company. Specified assets were pledged as collateral. One facility was a line of credit in the amount of $4.0 million available until December 1, 2024 (the “Facility 1”). Interest on Facility 1 was due on the first day of each month beginning January 1, 2022. The interest rate was an annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the greater of the BSBY Daily Floating Rate or (ii) the Index Floor (as defined in the Loan Agreement), plus 2.00%. The Company did not utilize the facility during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During May 2023, the facility was terminated.​The other facility extended by the Bank to the Company was a fixed rate term loan in the amount of up to $16.0 million (the “Facility 2”). Facility 2 was entered into and funded in conjunction with the purchase of Kestrel Labs at an interest rate equal to 2.8% per year. The Company had to pay interest on the first day of each month which began January 1, 2022, and the Company also repaid the principal amount in equal installments of $444,444 per month. All unpaid interest and principal on Facility 2 was fully paid off and the Facility was terminated during May 2023.(8)   CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTESIn May 2023, the Company issued $52.5 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2026 (the “2023 Convertible Senior Notes”). In May 2023, the Company issued an additional $7.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes upon the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option.Interest on the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, beginning November 15, 2023. The 2023 Convertible Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and are redeemable at the option of the Company on or after May 20, 2025. The 2023 Convertible Senior Notes are direct, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of the Company, ranking equally with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding, and are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of the Company.F-17
Table of ContentsHolders may convert their 2023 Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day preceding September 30, 2023, but only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least twenty trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day as determined by the Company; during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2023 Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes. On or after February 15, 2026, a holder may convert all or any portion of its 2023 Convertible Senior Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions.The Company will settle conversions of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes being converted. The 2023 Convertible Senior Notes are initially convertible at a rate of 92.8031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount converted, which is approximately equal to $10.78 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change, which includes certain change in control transactions, the approval by Zynex’s stockholders of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Zynex and certain de-listing events with respect to Zynex’s common stock, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for conversions in connection with the make-whole fundamental change. On December 31, 2024, the closing price of the Company’s common stock was $8.01 and the conversion feature of our outstanding convertible senior notes allows their holders to convert principal at a conversion price of $10.78. Under such circumstances, if all outstanding principal of $60.0 million would have been converted into conversion shares, the market value of such shares would have been $44.6 million.Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 2023 Convertible Senior Notes, in principal amounts equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. $3.0 million of coupon interest expense and $1.0 million of bond amortization costs were included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. Unamortized issuances costs of $1.4 million and $2.4 million were included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective interest rate on the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes was 6.8% during both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. $1.9 of coupon interest expense and $0.6 million of bond amortization costs were included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.The following table summarizes the minimum interest payments over the next two years until maturity in May 2026.​​​​​​    (In thousands)2025​$ 3,0002026​  1,500​​(9)   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANSZynex, Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive PlanIn June 2017, our stockholders approved the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2017 Stock Plan”) with a maximum of 5.5 million shares reserved for issuance.

The accounting standard requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are to be recognized. Differences between financial and tax reporting which do not meet this threshold are required to be recorded as unrecognized tax benefits. This standard also provides guidance on the presentation of tax matters and the recognition of potential interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company does not have an unrecognized tax liability.F-23
Table of ContentsThe Company does not classify penalty and interest expense related to income tax liabilities as an income tax expense. Penalties and interest are included within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions, and there are open statutes of limitations for taxing authorities to audit our tax returns from 2021 through the current period.​(12)   LEASESThe Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or financing leases. Leases include various office and warehouse facilities which have been categorized as operating leases, while certain equipment is leased under financing leases.During March 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 4,162 square feet of office space for the operations of ZMS in Boulder, Colorado. The lease began on April 1, 2022 and will run through April 1, 2025. The rent and common area maintenance charges are equal to $17.00 per square foot with annual increases of 3%. Upon lease commencement, the Company recorded an operating lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for $0.2 million each. During February 2023, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 41,427 square feet of office space for the operations of ZMS in Englewood, CO. The lease commences on July 1, 2023 and runs through December 31, 2028. At the expiration of the lease term the Company has the option to renew the lease for one additional five-year period. The Company is entitled to rent abatements for the first six months of the lease and tenant improvement allowances. Payments based on the initial rate of $24.75 per square foot begin in January 2024. The price per square foot increases by an additional $0.50 during each subsequent twelve-month period of the lease after the abatement period. Upon lease commencement, the Company recorded an operating lease liability of $4.2 million and a corresponding right-of-use asset for $2.8 million. The Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate was determined to be 4.84% for its operating lease liabilities. The Company’s equipment lease agreements have a weighted average rate of 5.02% which was used to measure its finance lease liability.As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s operating and financing leases have a weighted average remaining term of 3.36 years and 4.18 years, respectively.The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments under the Company’s operating and finance leases to the total operating and capital lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands): ​​​​​​​​​    Operating Lease Liability    Finance Lease Liability2025 ​ 4,632 ​ 3362026 ​ 4,428 ​ 3122027 ​ 4,237 ​ 2642028 ​ 2,172 ​ 1712029 ​ — ​ 121Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments​$ 15,469​$ 1,204Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities:​  (1,288)​  (128)Total lease liabilities​$ 14,181​$ 1,076​​F-24

The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The Company measures its long-term debt at fair value which approximates book value as the long-term debt bears market rates of interest. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is based on a Monte Carlo models. The valuation policies are determined by management, and the Company’s Board of Directors is informed of any policy change.Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on reliability of the inputs as follows:Level I: Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to Zynex for identical assets or liabilities;Level II: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active or inactive markets or that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; andLevel III: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.The Company’s assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and/or out of fair value hierarchy as of the date on which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer. The Company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed below in all periods presented.The Company classified its contingent consideration liability in connection with the acquisition of Kestrel within Level 3 as factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.F-25
Table of ContentsThe contingent consideration related to Kestrel was valued at $9.7 million using a Monte Carlo simulation as of December 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the contingent consideration was estimated at $10.0 million, and the adjustment of $0.3 million during 2022 was recorded as a loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration was based on a Monte Carlo model prior to December 31, 2023. See Note 3 - Business Combinations for additional details on the removal of contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table presents the Company’s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis prior to December 31, 2023, which were included within Level III of the fair value hierarchy:​​​​​​    Contingent ConsiderationBalance as of December 31, 2022​$ 10,000

To the extent that such claims and litigation arise, management provides for them if losses are determined to be both probable and estimable. On occasion, the Company engages outside counsel related to a broad range of topics including employment law, third-party payer matters, intellectual property, and regulatory and compliance matters.The Company is currently not a party to any material pending legal proceedings that would give rise to potential loss contingencies.(15)  CONCENTRATIONSThe Company is exposed to concentration of credit risk related primarily to its cash balances. The Company maintains its cash balances in major financial institutions that exceed amounts insured by the FDIC (up to $250,000, per financial institution).

Management believes that the Company’s relationships with its suppliers are good. If the relationships were to be replaced, there may be a short-term disruption for a period of time during which products may not be available and additional expenses may be incurred as the Company locates additional or replacement suppliers.The Company had gross receivables from no third-party payers which made up 10% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ​(16)  RETIREMENT PLANIn 2012, the Company established a defined contribution retirement plan for its employees under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”) that is available to all employees 18 years of age or older with at least three months of service.
