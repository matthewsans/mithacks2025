We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 16, 2018. We were engaged in the business of selling beauty sample subscriptions. In December 2020, we acquired several gold mining claims in Canada as we have switched our focus to the mining industry. We planned to begin exploration on the properties. Due to Covid and economic downturn, we were unable to proceed with the mining property exploration. Upon the expiration of the two years term of the property mining rights, we decided not to extend beyond the original term of the mining rights and was fully impaired through year ended April 30, 2023. On October 18, 2022, majority of the Company’s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to twenty (20) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by FINRA for approval on February 21, 2023. The financial statements retroactively reflect the reverse stock split. On January 8, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a surveying consulting firm for mining and mineral exploration and surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties. On February 14, 2023, the Company’s name changed to Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and the Company trading symbol changed to “NRHI” effective March 21, 2023. We are currently in negotiations to acquire other mining rights in Canada.  3Table of Contents EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable. Item 1C. Cybersecurity We have implemented cybersecurity risk management procedures, in accordance with our risk profile and business size. We rely on our information technology to operate our business. As such, we have policies and processes designed to protect our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, and resolve issues in a timely manner in the event of a cybersecurity threat or incident. We have designed our business applications to minimize the impact that cybersecurity incidents could have on our business and have identified back-up systems where appropriate. We seek to further mitigate cybersecurity risks through a combination of monitoring and detection activities, use of anti-malware applications, employee training, quality audits and communication and reporting structures, among other processes. We have a trained group of people to carry out the activities of monitoring and detection of cybersecurity threats and respond to any cybersecurity threats or incidents. The Head of IT department is responsible for oversight of cybersecurity risks and addressing potential cybersecurity risks to business programs, employees, clients, vendors and partners. The Head of IT Department reports to our Chief Executive Officer who reports to the Audit Committee at the board-level, as appropriate. As of April 30, 2025, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business and consolidated financial statements. Item 2. Description of Property We do not own any real estate or other properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We know of no legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is the subject which are pending, threatened or contemplated or any unsatisfied judgments against us. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None.  4Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Market Information There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. As of April 30, 2025, no shares of our common stock have traded. Number of Holders As of July 7, 2025, the 5,589,891 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 11 shareholders of record. Dividends No cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Purchase of our Equity Securities by Officers and Directors None. Other Stockholder Matters None. Item 6. Selected Financial Data Not applicable. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Results of Operations We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  5Table of Contents We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. The following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, which are included herein:   Year Ended         April 30,  Changes   2025  2024  Amount  %              Operating Expenses $(43,731) $(2,040,568) $1,996,837  (98%)Other Expenses  (6,802)  (6,790)  (12)  - Net Loss $(50,533) $(2,047,358) $1,996,825  (98%) During the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not earn any revenue. Net loss for the year ended April 30, 2025 was $50,533 compared to $2,047,358 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The decrease in net loss during the year ended April 30, 2025 was due to the decrease in operating expenses. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company incurred stock-based compensation of $2,000,000 for the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of common stock to the Director of the Company valued as management salaries  Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital     As of    As of          April 30,  April 30,  Changes   2025  2024  Amount  %              Current Assets $-  $-  $-   - Current Liabilities $179,042  $167,597  $11,445   6.8%Working Capital Deficiency $(179,042) $(167,597) $(11,445)  6.8% Our total current liabilities as of April 30, 2025 were $179,042 as compared to total current liabilities of $167,597 as of April 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in accrued interest during the year ended April 30, 2025. Our working capital deficiency as of April 30, 2025 was $179,042 as compared to our working capital deficiency of $167,597 as of April 30, 2024. The increase in working capital deficiency was mainly due to the increase in accrued interest and accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year ended April 30, 2025. Cash Flows   Year Ended         April 30,  Changes   2025  2024  Amount  %              Cash flows used in operating activities $(40,684) $(41,044) $360  (1%) Cash flows used in investing activities  -   (39,237)  39,237   (100%) Cash flows provided by financing activities  40,684   80,281   (39,597) (49%) Net changes in cash  $-  $-  $-   -   6Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $40,684 for the year ended April 30, 2025 compared with $41,044 used in operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2024. During the year ended April 30, 2025, the net cash of $40,684 used in operating activities was attributed to net loss of $50,533, decreased by amortization on mining property rights of $1,962 and amortization on note discount of $3,416 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4,471. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the net cash of $41,044 used in operating activities was attributed to net loss of $2,047,358 decreased by stock-based compensation of $2,000,000, amortization on mining property rights of $490 and amortization on note discount of $3,425 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2,399. Cash Flows from Investing Activity We had no investing activities during the year ended April 30, 2025. During the year ended April 30, 2024, net cash from investing activity was $39,237 for acquisition of mining property rights. Cash Flows from Financing Activity During the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, net cash from financing activity was $40,684 and $80,281 through issuance of promissory notes from an unaffiliated party, respectively. Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  7Table of Contents Going Concern The independent auditors’ report accompanying our April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt About the Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered from a net loss of $50,533 and working capital deficit of $179,042 for the year ended April 30, 2025 and as of April 30, 2025, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,513,015. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Board of Director (Those Charged with Governance) that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical matters.     /s/ JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT  JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT (PCAOB: 6723)   We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia   July 11, 2025    10Table of Contents NATURAL RESOURCE HOLDINGS, INC.BALANCE SHEETS   April 30,2025  April 30,2024 ASSETS       Current Assets       Total Current Assets $-  $-          Non-current Assets         Mining property rights, net  36,785   38,747          TOTAL ASSETS  $36,785  $38,747          LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT         Current Liabilities         Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $31,514  $30,427 Accrued interest  15,555   12,170 Loan payable                            6,973     -  Income tax interest and penalty payable  125,000   125,000 Total Current Liabilities  179,042   167,597          Non-current Liabilities         Convertible note payable, net of note discount of $2,293 and $5,708, respectively  168,958   124,859 Loan payable  -   6,973 TOTAL LIABILITIES   348,000   299,429          Stockholders’ Deficit         Common stock, par value $0.001;

(the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on April 19, 2016. We were a development stage company that intended to develop an online beauty sample subscription service. On November 26, 2020, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain mining properties. The mining property right was fully impaired during the year ended April 30, 2022. On October 18, 2022, majority of the Company’s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to twenty (20) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by FINRA for approval on February 21, 2023. The financial statements retroactively reflect the reverse stock split. On January 8, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a surveying consulting firm for mining and mineral exploration and surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties. On February 14, 2023, the Company’s name changed to Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and the Company trading symbol changed to “NRHI” effective March 21, 2023. We are currently focusing on mining business. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) of the United States.  Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. These tiers include: Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; andLevel 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  15Table of Contents The carrying value of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued interest, current portion of long-term debt, other party loan and loan from director approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.  Convertible Financial Instruments The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP. Mining Property Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred as it is still in the exploration stage. If the Company identifies proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs are amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the commencement of production.  Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed. ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining: Business Combinations” states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights which are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims. ASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:  (a)The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.    (b)The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of long-lived assets”, and evaluates its carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive Activities - Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value.  Based on the Company’s evaluation, no impairment has been recorded on the mineral properties for the period ended April 30, 2025.   16Table of Contents On January 8, 2023, the Company incurred mining exploration expense of $8,500 for surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties performed during January and February 2023. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Company purchased a mining claim (the Montreal Star Property) of $34,487 and a mining claim (Union Park 002) of $4,750. (Note 4) The mining property rights are amortized over estimated useful life of 20 years. Intangible Assets The Company accounts for intangible assets (including mining right) in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.” ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. Revenue Recognition The Company recognized revenue from the sales of mineral products produced from mining operations in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure: Step 1: The contract has been signed by both parties or when the invoice has been generated and provided to the customerStep 2: The performance obligations are stated or implied in the contract or invoiceStep 3: The transaction price has been identified in the contract or invoiceStep 4: The Company has allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations pursuant to the contract or invoiceStep 5: The Company satisfied the performance obligations when the mineral products delivered to the purchaser The Company recognized revenue from the royalty revenue in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure: Step 1: The contract has been signed by both parties for royalty feesStep 2: The performance obligations are stated or implied in the contractStep 3: The transaction price has been identified in the contractStep 4: The Company has allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations pursuant to the contractStep 5: The Company has satisfied the performance obligations at the same period as the sales that generate the royalty payment. Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the mining property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.  17Table of Contents Income Tax Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.  The Company has not filed income tax returns from year ended April 30, 2016 through April 30, 2020. $25,000 annual late tax filing interest and penalty was accrued for an aggregate amount of $125,000. Related Party Balances and Transactions The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (Note 5). Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, convertible notes were dilutive instruments and were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive:   April 30,  April 30,   2025  2024   (Shares)  (Shares) Convertible note payable  489,289   373,049  As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the total convertible shares from convertible notes totaling $168,958 and $124,859 issued to an unaffiliated party from February 4, 2022 through April 30, 2025 with conversion rate of $0.35 per shares was 489,289 shares and 373,049 shares. (Note 6).  Recent accounting pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our financial statements and disclosures.   18Table of Contents In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) - Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our financial statements and disclosures. Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements. Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Recent adopted accounting standards In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which require public companies disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures. The Company does not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements. NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN The Company’s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,513,015. For the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company suffered from a net loss of $50,533 and working capital deficit of $179,042. The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the financial support from its major shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 4 – MINING PROPERTY RIGHTS During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Company purchased a mining claim (the Montreal Star Property) of $34,487 and a mining claim (Union Park 002) of $4,750. Mining Property Right $39,237 Less: Amortization  (490 )Less: Impairment  - Carrying Amount as of April 30, 2024 $38,747 Less: Amortization  (1,962 )Less: Impairment  - Carrying Amount as of April 30, 2025 $36,785   19Table of Contents The Company has acquired the mining property rights on the two mining properties which consist of the legal right to explore, extract and also expect to retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. The plan is to start drilling tests and the mining operations will commence once it is viable to do so. Currently, the Company is in the process of engaging an exploration company to handle the project. The surveying and exploration proposals consist of drilling vertical holes into the ground to identify the best locations to mine. There are proposals to drill from 6 to 50 holes, and the Company is still evaluating the proposals to find the best plan. The development stage will start upon successful conclusion of exploration stage. During the period, the Company is deciding between several options for the exploration stage and as of the date of this financial statement, the conclusion is yet to be made. The mining property rights are amortized over estimated useful life of 20 years. During the year ended April 30, 2025, the amortization was $1,962. As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, Mining Property Rights were $36,785 and $38,747, net of accumulated amortization of $2,452 and $490, respectively. NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On July 1, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $153,913 to the Company’s director for previous operating expenses of $28,913 and acquisition of mining interest of $125,000 which were paid by the director on the Company’s behalf as of April 30, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of 2% and has a mature date of December 31, 2022. In December 2020, the Company acquired several gold mining claims in Canada. The Company planned for exploration on the properties. Due to Covid and economic downturn, the Company was unable to proceed with the mining property exploration. Upon the expiration of the two years term of the property mining rights, the Company decided not to extend beyond the original term of the mining rights and was fully impaired during year ended April 30, 2022. On July 31, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $2,822 for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended July 31, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of 2% and has a mature date of December 31, 2022. On October 31, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $11,450 for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended October 31, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of 2% and has a mature date of December 31, 2022. On January 31, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note of $7,021 for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended January 31, 2022.

Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025 using the criteria established in “ Internal Control - Integrated Framework “ issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.  1.We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.    2.We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of April 30, 2025, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.    3.We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at April 30, 2025, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls. As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.  23Table of Contents PART III Item 10.
