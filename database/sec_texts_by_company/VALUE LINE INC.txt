A. Investment Related Periodicals & Publications
The investment periodicals and related publications offered by Value Line Publishing LLC (“VLP”), a wholly-owned entity of the Company, cover a broad spectrum of investments including stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and options. The Company’s periodicals and related publications and services are marketed to individual and professional investors, as well as to institutions including municipal and university libraries and investment firms.

Value Line offers digital versions of most of its products through the Company’s website, www.valueline.com. Subscribers to the print versions have, in some cases, received free access to the corresponding digital versions, although digital subscribers do not receive a free print edition. The most comprehensive of the Company’s online platforms is The Value Line Research Center, which allows subscribers to access most of the Company’s research and publications at a packaged price via the Internet.
Investment analysis software (The Value Line Investment Analyzer and The Value Line ETFs Service) includes data sorting and filtering tools. In addition, for institutional and professional subscribers, VLP offers current and historical financial databases (DataFile, Estimates & Projections, and Mutual Funds) via the Internet.
The print and digital services include, but are not limited to the following:
The Value Line Investment Survey
The Value Line Investment Survey is an investment periodical research service providing both timely articles on economic, financial and investment matters and analysis and ranks for equity securities. Two of the evaluations for covered equity securities are "Timeliness™" and "Safety™”. “Timeliness” Ranks relate to the probable relative price performance of one stock over the next six to twelve months, as compared to the rest of the stock coverage universe. Ranks are updated each week and range from Rank 1 for the expected best performing stocks to Rank 5 for the expected poorest performers. "Safety" Ranks are a measure of risk and are based on the issuer's relative Financial Strength and its stock's Price Stability. "Safety" ranges from Rank 1 for the least risky stocks to Rank 5 for the riskiest. VLP employs analysts and statisticians who prepare articles of interest for each periodical and who evaluate stock performance and provide future earnings estimates and quarterly written evaluations with more frequent updates when relevant. The Value Line Investment Survey is comprised of three parts: The "Summary & Index" provides updated Timeliness and Safety Ranks, selected financial data, and "screens" of key financial measures; the "Ratings & Reports" section contains the updated reports on stocks each week; and the “Selection & Opinion” section provides economic commentary and data, articles, and model portfolios managed by analysts covering a range of investment approaches.
The Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap
The Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap is an investment research tool introduced in 1995 that provides short descriptions of and extensive data for small and medium-capitalization stocks, many listed on The NASDAQ Exchange, beyond the equity securities of generally larger-capitalization companies covered in The Value Line Investment Survey. Like The Value Line Investment Survey, the Small and Mid-Cap has its own "Summary & Index" providing updated performance ranks and other data, as well as "screens" of key financial measures and two model portfolios. The print portion of the service is issued monthly. The 400 stocks of the Small & Mid-Cap universe selected for inclusion in the print component of the service are mailed to subscribers in updated monthly groups. Each stock is covered 4 times per year – once per quarterly cycle. The Digital component of the service remains unchanged – it is updated weekly with the complete stock coverage universe available for review. The Performance Rank is designed to predict relative price performance over the next six to twelve months.
The Value Line Fund Advisor Plus
The Value Line Mutual Fund Ranking System was introduced in 1993. It is the system utilized in The Fund Advisor Plus, featuring load, no-load, and low-load open-end mutual funds. Each issue offers strategies for investing in mutual funds, and highlights of specific mutual funds. A full statistical review, including latest performance, ranks, and sector weightings, is updated each month on approximately 800 leading load, no-load and low-load funds. Included with this product is online access to Value Line’s database of approximately 20,000 mutual funds, including screening tools and full-page printable reports on each fund. Four model portfolios are also part of the service. One recommends specific U.S. mutual funds from different objective groups, while the other highlights similar exchange traded funds (ETFs). The remaining two highlight mutual funds and ETFs globally. The Value Line Fund Advisor Plus contains data on approximately 20,000 no-load and low-load funds and a digital screener.

The Value Line Special Situations Service
The Value Line Special Situations Service’s core focus is on smaller companies whose equity securities are perceived by Value Line’s analysts as having exceptional appreciation potential. This publication was introduced in 1951.
The Value Line Daily Options Survey

Value Line Select
Value Line Select is a monthly stock selection service and was first published in 1998. It focuses each month on a single company that the Value Line Research Department has selected from a group of high-quality companies whose stocks are viewed as having a superior risk/reward ratio. Recommendations are backed by in-depth research and are subject to ongoing monitoring by research personnel.
Value Line Select: Dividend Income & Growth
Value Line Select: Dividend Income & Growth (formerly Value Line Dividend Select), a monthly stock selection service, was introduced in June 2011. This product focuses on companies with dividend yields greater than the average of all stocks covered by Value Line, with a preference for companies that have consistently increased their dividends above the rate of inflation over the longer term and, based on Value Line analysis, have the financial strength both to support and increase dividend payments in the future.
Value Line Select ETFs
In May 2017, we launched Value Line Select ETFs, a monthly ETF selection service. This product focuses on ETFs that appear poised to outperform the broader market. The selection process utilizes an industry approach, with the same data-focused analysis that is the hallmark of Value Line.
The Value Line ETFs Service
This online-only, web based analysis software provides data, analysis, and screening capabilities on more than 2,700 publicly traded ETFs. Almost all of the ETFs tracked in the product are ranked by The Value Line ETF Ranking System. The screener includes more than 30 fields, and each ETF has its own full PDF report. All data and information can be downloaded, exported, and printed.
The Value Line 600
The Value Line 600 is a monthly publication, which contains full-page research reports on approximately 600 equity securities. Its reports provide information on many actively traded, larger capitalization issues as well as some smaller growth stocks. It offers investors who want the same type of analysis provided in The Value Line Investment Survey, but who do not want or need coverage of all the companies covered by that product, a suitable alternative. Readers also receive supplemental reports as well as a monthly Index, which includes updated statistics, including proprietary ranks and ratings.

The Value Line M&A Service
This is a monthly service that was launched in September 2020. The objective of the service is to identify companies that possess characteristics, such as a successful product lineup, market position or important technology that would interest larger corporations or private equity firms. The main feature of the M&A Service consists of a detailed, multipage highlight on a stock that Value Line thinks is a good acquisition candidate. New recommendations are then added to the M&A Model Portfolio.
The Value Line Climate Change Investing Service
This monthly service was introduced in April 2021. This publication, designed for the climate-conscious, profit-oriented investor, seeks to provide key climate news alongside a managed portfolio of twenty stocks, chosen by our analysts, which stand to benefit from responses to climate change. Selections are vetted based not only on time-tested financial measures, but also the potential impact of climate change and measures taken to combat it on their business. Our selections fall into two main groups: businesses that are focused on providing environmental solutions, and those that are likely to thrive in a changing climate. Every issue features new updates to our portfolio.

B. Copyright Programs
The Company’s available copyright services, which include certain proprietary Ranking System results and other proprietary information are made available for use in third party products, such as unit investment trusts, variable annuities, managed accounts and exchange traded funds. The sponsors of these products act as wholesalers and distribute the products generally by syndicating them through an extensive network of national and regional brokerage firms. The sponsors of these products will typically receive Proprietary Ranking System results, which may include Value Line Timeliness, Safety, Technical and Performance ranks, as screens for their portfolios. The sponsors are also given permission to associate Value Line’s trademarks with the products. Value Line collects a copyright fee from each of the product sponsors/managers primarily based upon the market value of assets invested in each product’s portfolio utilizing the Value Line proprietary data. Since these fees are based on the market value of the respective portfolios using the Value Line proprietary data, the payments to Value Line, which are typically received on a quarterly basis, will fluctuate.
Value Line’s primary copyright products are structured as ETFs and Unit Investment Trusts, all of which have in common some degree of reliance on the Value Line Ranking System for their portfolio creation. These products are offered and distributed by independent sponsors.
C. Investment Management Services
Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company receives an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election, removal or replacement of the trustees of EAM. The business of EAM is managed by five individual trustees and a Delaware resident trustee (collectively, the “Trustees”) and by its officers subject to the direction of the Trustees.
Collectively, the holders of the voting profits interests in EAM are entitled to receive 50% of the residual profits of the business, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances. Value Line holds a non-voting profits interest representing 50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances, and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the trustees of EAM. Value Line also has a non-voting revenues interest in EAM pursuant to which it is entitled to receive a portion of the non-distribution revenues of the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee revenue levels of $9 million or less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. In the event the business is sold or liquidated, the first $56.1 million of net proceeds plus any additional capital contributions (Value Line or any holder of a voting profits interest, at its discretion, may make future contributions to its capital account in EAM), which contributions would increase its capital account but not its percentage interest in operating profits, will be distributed in accordance with capital accounts; 20% of the next $56.1 million will be distributed to the holders of the voting profits interests and 80% to the holder of the non-voting profits interests (currently, Value Line); and the excess will be distributed 45% to the holders of the voting profits interests and 55% to the holder of the non-voting profits interest (Value Line). EAM has elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership.
Also, pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, Value Line (1) granted each Fund use of the name “Value Line” so long as EAM remains the Fund’s adviser and on the condition that the Fund does not alter its investment objectives or fundamental policies from those in effect on the date of the investment advisory agreement with EAM, provided also that the Funds do not use leverage for investment purposes or engage in short selling or other complex or unusual investment strategies that create a risk profile similar to that of so-called hedge funds, (2) agreed to provide EAM its proprietary Ranking System information without charge or expense on as favorable basis as to Value Line’s best institutional customers and (3) agreed to capitalize the business with $7 million of cash and cash equivalents at inception.
EAM is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and has no fixed term. However, in the event that control of the Company’s majority shareholder changes, or in the event that the majority shareholder no longer beneficially owns 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company, then the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the voting profits interests in EAM at a fair market value to be determined by an independent valuation firm in accordance with the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust.
11
Value Line also has certain consent rights with respect to extraordinary events involving EAM, such as a proposed sale of all or a significant part of EAM, material acquisitions, entering into businesses other than asset management and fund distribution, paying compensation in excess of the mandated limit of 22.5%-30% of non-distribution fee revenues (depending on the level of such revenues), declaring voluntary bankruptcy, making material changes in tax or accounting policies or making substantial borrowings, and entering into related party transactions. These rights were established to protect Value Line’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM.
EAM acts as the Adviser to the Value Line Funds. EULAV Securities acts as the Distributor for the Value Line Funds. State Street Bank, an unaffiliated entity, is the custodian of the assets of the Value Line Funds and provides them with fund accounting and administrative services. Shareholder services for the Value Line Funds are provided by SS&C.
The Company maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by EAM and will continue to receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below. Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2025, were $4.68 billion, which is $0.51 billion, or 12.0%, above total assets of $4.17 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024.

Investment management fees and distribution service fees (“12b-1 fees”) vary among the Value Line Funds and may be subject to certain limitations. Certain investment strategies among the equity funds include, but are not limited to, reliance on the Value Line Timeliness ™ Ranking System (the “Ranking System”) and/or the Value Line Performance Ranking System in selecting securities for purchase or sale. Each Ranking System seeks to compare the estimated probable market performance of each stock during the next six to twelve months to that of all stocks under review in each system and ranks stocks on a scale of 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). All the stocks followed by the Ranking System are listed on U.S. stock exchanges or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter markets. Prospectuses and annual reports for each of the Value Line open end mutual funds are available on the Funds’ website www.vlfunds.com. Each mutual fund may use "Value Line" in its name only to the extent permitted by the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust.

The Company has adopted rules requiring reports of securities transactions by employees for their respective accounts.

H. Principal Business Segments
The information with respect to revenues from external customers and profit and loss of the Company's identifiable principal business segments is incorporated herein by reference to Note 18 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
I. Competition
The investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very competitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and EAM. The Internet continues to increase the amount of competition in the form of free and paid online investment research. With regard to the investment management business conducted by EAM, the prevalence of broker supermarkets or platforms permitting easy transfer of assets among mutual funds, mutual fund families, and other investment vehicles tends to increase the speed with which shareholders can leave or enter the Value Line Funds based, among other things, on short-term fluctuations in performance, variations in their ratings by outside agencies, advisers and others.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risks referred to elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks, among others, sometimes may have affected, and in the future could affect, the Company’s business operations, financial condition or results of operations and/or the investment management business conducted by EAM and consequently, the amount of income we receive from EAM. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not discussed or not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impact our business.
The Company and its subsidiaries are dependent on the efforts of its executives and professional staff.
The Company’s future success relies upon its ability to retain and recruit qualified professionals and executives. The Company’s executive officers do not have employment agreements with the Company and the Company does not maintain “key man” insurance policies on any of its executive officers. The loss of the services of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.
A decrease in the revenue generated by EAM’s investment management business could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.
The Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow from its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. A decrease in the revenue generated by EAM’s investment management business, whether resulting from performance, competitive, regulatory or other reasons, would reduce the amount of cash flow received by the Company from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.
EAM’s assets under management, which impact EAM’s revenue, and consequently the amount of the cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions, individual fund performance, and the decisions of investors.
Financial market declines and/or adverse changes in interest rates would generally negatively impact the level of EAM’s assets under management and consequently its revenue and net income. Major sources of investment management revenue for EAM (i.e., investment management and service and distribution fees) are calculated as percentages of assets under management. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products or an increase in fund redemptions would reduce fee income. Investors are free to add to or withdraw from their account at any time and tend to make those decisions based on several factors, including ratings by popular services, performance, longevity of individual managers in their roles, trends in investing styles, and others. A prolonged recession or other economic or political events could also adversely impact EAM’s revenue if it led to decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices. Good performance of managed assets relative to both competing products and benchmark indices generally assists in both retention and growth of assets, and may result in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance of managed assets relative to competing products or benchmark indices tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to EAM. Poor performance could also result in less favorable ratings from established mutual fund rating services and cause assets to be withdrawn from the Value Line Funds and reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition.
EAM derives substantially all of its investment management fees from the Value Line Funds.
EAM is dependent upon management contracts and service and distribution contracts with the Value Line Funds under which these fees are paid. As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), the Trustees/Directors of the Funds, all of whom are independent of the Company and EAM (except for the CEO of EAM), have the right to terminate such contracts. If any of these contracts are terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, EAM’s financial results, and consequently, the amount of cash flow received by the Company from EAM, and the Company’s financial condition, may be adversely affected.
A decrease in the revenue generated by a significant customer could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.
The Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow and publishing revenues from a single significant customer.
15
If the Company does not maintain its subscriber base, its operating results could suffer.
A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from print and digital subscriptions, which are paid in advance by subscribers. Unearned revenues are accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company within current and long-term liabilities. The backlog of orders is primarily generated through renewals and new subscription marketing efforts as the Company deems appropriate. Future results will depend on the renewal of existing subscribers and obtaining new subscriptions for the investment periodicals and related publications. The availability of competitive information on the Internet at low or no cost has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the demand for our products.
The Company believes that the negative trend in retail print subscription revenue is likely to continue.
The Company has experienced a negative trend in retail print subscription revenue. While circulation of some print publications has increased, others have experienced a decline in circulation or in average yearly price realized. It is expected that print revenues overall will continue to decline long-term, while the Company emphasizes digital offerings. The Company has established the goal of maintaining competitive digital products and marketing them through traditional and digital channels to retail and institutional customers. However, the Company is not able to predict whether revenues from digital retail publications will grow more than print revenues decline.
Loss of copyright clients or decline in their customers, or assets managed by third party sponsors could reduce the Company’s revenues.
Copyright agreements revenues are based on market interest in the respective proprietary information. The Company believes this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the Value Line trademarks and proprietary research for their products, competition and on fluctuations in segments of the equity markets. If the fees from proprietary information decline, the Company’s operating results could suffer.
Failure to protect its intellectual property rights and proprietary information could harm the Company’s ability to compete effectively and could negatively affect operating results.
The Company’s trademarks are important assets to the Company. Although its trademarks are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries, the Company may not always be successful in asserting global trademark protection. In the event that other parties infringe on its intellectual property rights and it is not successful in defending its intellectual property rights, the result may be a dilution in the value of the Company’s brands in the marketplace. If the value of the Company’s brands becomes diluted, such developments could adversely affect the value that its customers associate with its brands, and thereby negatively impact its sales. Any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of Company resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able successfully to resolve such claims. The Company is utilizing all of its trademarks and properly maintaining registrations for them.
The Company and EAM face significant competition in their respective businesses.
Both the investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very competitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and EAM. With regard to the investment information and publishing business, barriers to entry have been reduced by the minimal cost structure of the Internet and other technologies. With regard to the investment management business, both the absence of significant barriers to entry by new investment management firms and a trend of strong growth by the largest industry participants in the funds industry increases competitive pressure. Further, a larger share of new sales is accounted for by exchange traded with EAM’s business competing only in the latter segment. Competition in the investment management business is based on various factors, including business reputation, investment performance, investment management staffs, quality of service, marketing, distribution services offered, the range of products offered and fees charged. Access to mutual fund distribution channels has also become increasingly competitive.
16
Government regulations, any changes to government regulations, and regulatory proceedings and litigation may adversely impact the business.
Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements could have an effect on EAM’s operations and results, including but not limited to increased expenses and restraints on marketing certain funds and other investment products. EAM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. ES is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, also known as “FINRA”. Each Value Line Fund is a registered investment company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires numerous compliance measures, which must be observed, and involves regulation by the SEC. Each fund and its shareholders may face adverse tax consequences if the Value Line Funds are unable to maintain qualification as registered investment companies under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Those laws and regulations generally grant broad administrative powers to regulatory agencies and bodies such as the SEC and FINRA. If these agencies and bodies believe that EAM, ES or the Value Line Funds have failed to comply with their laws and regulations, these agencies and bodies have the power to impose sanctions. EAM, ES and the Value Line Funds, like other companies, can also face lawsuits by private parties. Regulatory proceedings and lawsuits are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies, and the costs associated with compliance, could adversely affect the business and operations of the EAM, ES and the Value Line Funds. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding or lawsuit against the EAM or ES could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to them or to the Value Line Funds and have an adverse effect on their respective business and operations. An adverse effect on the business and operations of EAM, ES and/or the Value Line Funds could reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM and, consequently, could adversely affect the Company’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
Terrorist attacks could adversely affect the Company and EAM.
A terrorist attack, including biological or chemical weapons attacks, and the response to such terrorist attacks, could have a significant impact on the Company and its personnel, the United States economy, the global economy, and U.S. and/or global financial markets, and could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and on the investment management business conducted by EAM.
Future pandemic outbreaks could disrupt the Company’s operations.
A substantial recurrence of infections of the COVID-19 virus or other new illnesses could disrupt Company printing and distribution operations, or supplies of materials and services needed for the print publishing business. While the Company believes that its office, editorial, and administrative operations, and those of its suppliers of data and other services, are adequately backed-up for fully remote operations if needed, likewise a future pandemic outbreak could interfere with the continuity of printing and distribution operations, as well as endangering personnel of the Company and its supply chain partners.
Our controlling stockholder exercises voting control over the Company and has the ability to elect or remove from office all of our directors.
As of April 30, 2025, AB&Co., Inc. beneficially owned 91.74% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s voting stock. AB&Co. is therefore able to exercise voting control with respect to all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal from office of all of our directors.
We are not subject to most of the listing standards that normally apply to companies whose shares are quoted on NASDAQ.
Our shares of common stock are quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”). Under the NASDAQ listing standards, we are deemed to be a “controlled company” by virtue of the fact that AB&Co. has voting power with respect to more than 50% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. A controlled company is not required to have a majority of its board of directors comprised of independent directors. Director nominees are not required to be selected or recommended for the board’s selection by a majority of independent directors or a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors, nor do the NASDAQ listing standards require a controlled company to certify the adoption of a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations process. A controlled company is also exempt from NASDAQ’s requirements regarding the determination of officer compensation by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Although we currently comply with certain of the NASDAQ listing standards that do not apply to controlled companies, our compliance is voluntary, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future.
17
We are subject to cyber risks and may incur costs in connection with our efforts to enhance and ensure security from cyber attacks.
Substantial aspects of our business depend on the continuous and secure operation of our computer systems and e-commerce websites. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of sensitive information, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers and employees. While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber security, our resources and technical sophistication may not be adequate to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel, insurance and services to enhance security or to respond to occurrences. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any possible future breaches of our systems. Likewise, serious interruption of any of the Company’s data flows, or processing methods including legacy systems, could interfere with normal continuity of operations.
Changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations.
New accounting pronouncements or tax rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting pronouncements or interpretations or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Changes to existing rules and pronouncements, future changes, if any, or the questioning of current practices or interpretations may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
None.
Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY
We believe that information security is a critical component of our business strategy. Therefore, we maintain and continuously assess and strengthen our cyber security program.
Management is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Company’s risk exposures and has adopted a risk management framework including identification, analysis and response to risks affecting our business. The Company has established a committee of senior leaders which is chaired by the Company’s Executive Director of Information Technology.
We regularly engage third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, which can include penetration testing, independent audits, or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and effectiveness of security controls.
We rely on third-party service providers for a variety of services to run our information systems. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers. A cyber-attack at a third-party service provider could have a significant impact on our business, and we continuously monitor the risks associated with our service providers.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for the oversight of the Company’s risk management program, including technology and cybersecurity risks facing the Company. The audit committee receives briefings from management and the executive director of information technology about cybersecurity risk management and the overall technology and cybersecurity environment.
We believe that currently we have not encountered a cybersecurity event that has had a material impact on our business. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our cybersecurity risks.

Item 2. PROPERTIES.
The Company leases 24,726 square feet of office space at 551 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. In addition to the New York office space, the Company leased a warehouse facility with 24,110 square feet in New Jersey until April 30, 2024. Value Line Distribution Center, Inc. (“VLDC”) distributed Value Line’s print publications prior to April 30, 2024. Operations have been outsourced to third parties in the United States effective April 30, 2024.
On November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on September 30, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first six months of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied against the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.

Executive Summary of the Business
The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line®, the Value Line logo®, The Value Line Investment Survey®, Smart Research, Smarter Investing™ and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research®. The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (“EAM”) was established to provide the investment management services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line® Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.
The Company’s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals. Individuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal libraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company’s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.
Payments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription. Accordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.
The investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company’s only reportable business segment.
22
Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses
Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.
The business of EAM is managed by its five individual trustees each owning 20% of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees. The Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders received the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.
Business Environment
The U.S. economy, after performing well in 2024, got off to a weak start in calendar 2025. The nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by an estimated 0.5% during the first quarter, statistically attributable to businesses and consumers buying ahead of the implementation of the Trump Administration’s wide-ranging tariffs on April 2, 2025. The surge in imports to the United States detracts from GDP. President Trump subsequently delayed or modified many of the levies.
The weak economic start to 2025, along with the still unsettled global trade environment and geopolitical unrest, including the war in Ukraine and the 12 days of aerial attacks between Israel and Iran, did bring a cautious reaction from the Federal Reserve on the monetary policy front. Indeed, the central bank kept the federal funds rate steady, in the range of 4.25% to 4.50%, during the first half of 2025, while it assessed the impact of the global developments on the rate of inflation stateside. There still are concerns that the tariffs may lead to a reacceleration in the pace of price growth, which, along with somewhat a softening labor market, could lead to a period of stagflation. Stagflation occurs when there are rising inflation and weakening employment at the same time the economy is slowing.
That said, while some of the soft (sentiment) data during the spring season, including a decline in consumer confidence, suggest that the economy is weakening, the hard data did not indicate as much. On the positive side, inflation on both the consumer and producer (wholesale) levels did ease some this spring; the job market proved resilient, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1% in June, a level indicative of full employment; and manufacturing activity, though still contracting, did come in above forecast during the month of June. This suggests that the economy likely returned to growth mode in the second quarter and the aforementioned stagflation scenario has yet to materialize.
Amid the global uncertainty, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate were able to produce a new budget deal that President Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. The President’s comprehensive tax and policy legislation, which is estimated to add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, also included legislation that increases the nation’s debt ceiling by $5 trillion. In the near-to-intermediate term, the new budget deal, along with the possibility that the Federal Reserve may enact one or two quarter-point cuts to the benchmark short-term interest rate, which is widely considered to be restrictive, in the second half of the year, may lift corporate and consumer spending. This may well spur GDP growth over the final six months of calendar 2025.
In all, the business environment has held up well amid the uncertain fiscal and monetary environment, highlighted by double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies during the first quarter of 2025. This, along with the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, helped the major averages climb the proverbial “wall of worry,” with the S&P 500 Index and technology-dominated NASDAQ Composite ending the first half of 2025 at record highs. That said, valuations looked quite frothy entering the second half of 2025 and with concerns over import tariffs and inflation still persisting, some share-price volatility can’t be ruled out.

Investment periodicals and related publications revenues
Investment periodicals and related publications revenues of $24,682,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 were 2.9% below publishing revenues of $25,420,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company continued and increased to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, particularly in volatile markets, total product line circulation at April 30, 2025, was 1.7% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2024.
Total print circulation at April 30, 2025 was 1.9% below the total print circulation at April 30, 2024. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, print publication revenues of $8,783,000, decreased 5.4%, below print publication revenues of $9,286,000 during April of 2024 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at April 30, 2025 was 1.5% below total digital circulation at April 30, 2024 with the professional clientele offsetting individual subscribers. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, digital revenues of $15,899,000 were down 1.5% as compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Further, publishing revenue is fairly steady, despite the dip in print circulation. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price “starter” products.
Investment periodicals and related publications revenues of $25,420,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 were 3.1% below publishing revenues of $26,232,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company continued actions to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, particularly in volatile markets, total product line circulation at April 30, 2024, was 3.2% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2023. However, Institutional Sales department total sales orders reached a record level last fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and this higher profit margin distribution to financial advisors and professional investors significantly offsets the long-term trend of declining individual investor circulation.
Total print circulation at April 30, 2024 was 4.6% below the total print circulation at April 30, 2023. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, print publication revenues of $9,286,000, decreased 6.8%, below print publication revenues of $9,963,000 during April of 2023 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at April 30, 2024 was 1.4% below total digital circulation at April 30, 2023 with the professional clientele offsetting individual subscribers. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, digital revenues of $16,134,000 were slightly below compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Further, publishing revenue is fairly steady, despite the dip in print circulation. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price “starter” products.
Investment periodicals and related publications revenues of $26,232,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 were 3.4% below publishing revenues of $27,145,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company continued actions to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, total product line circulation at April 30, 2023, was 10.4% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2022. However, during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, Institutional Sales department total sales orders, representing our growing business with financial advisors and professional investors, reached a record of $15,236,000, 10.0% above the prior fiscal year. The retail telemarketing sales team generated total sales orders of $7,409,000 or 10.6% below the prior fiscal year.
Total print circulation at April 30, 2023 was 16.0% below the total print circulation at April 30, 2022. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, print publication revenues of $9,963,000, decreased 11.5%, below print publication revenues of $11,253,000 during April of 2022 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at April 30, 2023 was 2.7% below total digital circulation at April 30, 2022 with the professional clientele offsetting individual subscribers. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, digital revenues of $16,269,000 were up 2.4% as compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Further, publishing revenue was fairly steady, despite the dip in print circulation.

Value Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, who pay mostly on annual subscription plans, for basic services or as much as $100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere. The ongoing goal of adding new subscribers has led us to introduce publications and packages at a range of price points. Prominently introduced in fiscal 2020 and 2021 were new features in the Value Line Research Center, which are The Value Line ETFs Service, monthly publication Value Line Information You Should Know Wealth Newsletter, The Value Line M & A Service, and our Value Line Climate Change Investing Service.
The Value Line Proprietary Ranks (the “Ranking System”), a component of the Company’s flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey, is also utilized in the Company’s copyright business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. During the six month period ended April 30, 2025, the combined Ranking System “Rank 1 & 2” stocks’ decrease of 6.0% compared favorably to the Russell 2000 Index’s decrease of 10.6% during the comparable period. During the twelve month period ended April 30, 2025, the combined Ranking System “Rank 1 & 2” stocks’ increase of 7.4% compared favorably to the Russell 2000 Index’s decrease of 0.5% during the comparable period.
Copyright fees
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, copyright fees of $10,397,000 were 13.8% below those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, copyright fees of $12,067,000 were 10.4% below those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, copyright fees of $13,463,000 were slightly above those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. These fees depend on the assets under management in financial products with contractual arrangements to use the Ranks and other Value Line proprietary information, which tend to fluctuate based on interest rates and ratings by fund rating agencies, among other factors.
Investment management fees and services – (unconsolidated)
The Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the investment adviser to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.
Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2025, were $4.68 billion, which is $0.51 billion, or 12.0%, above total assets of $4.17 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024.
Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024, were $4.17 billion, which is $1.08 billion, or 35.0%, above total assets of $3.09 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2023.

29
Operating expenses of $28,225,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, were 5.0% below those during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022 as a result of cost controls in fiscal year 2023.

During twelve months ended April 30, 2025, advertising and promotion expenses of $3,797,000 increased 28.5% as compared to the prior fiscal year. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, increases were primarily due to increases in direct mail and other promotion costs.
During twelve months ended April 30, 2024, advertising and promotion expenses of $2,955,000 decreased 3.1% as compared to the prior fiscal year. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, decreases were primarily due to decreases in total sales commissions.

During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, decreases were primarily due to decreases in media advertising expenses and direct mail campaigns, partially offset by increases in renewal solicitation costs and institutional sales commissions.
Salaries and employee benefits
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, salaries and employee benefits of $14,455,000 decreased 2.7% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits resulting from reduced employee headcount and the outsourcing of the Company’s distribution operation to domestic contractors since the latter part of fiscal 2024.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, salaries and employee benefits of $14,851,000 decreased 2.3% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits resulting from a reduced employee headcount in fiscal year 2024.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, salaries and employee benefits of $15,203,000 decreased 12.2% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits resulting from a reduced employee headcount in fiscal year 2023, as well as reductions in payment for a profit sharing contribution and the company’s share of medical benefits.

Production and distribution
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, production and distribution expenses of $5,987,000 increased 9.8% above the prior fiscal year primarily due to increases in third-party distribution and mailing expenses that resulted from outsourcing our internal distribution operations after April 2024, while ending our internal VLDC operation at April 30, 2024.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, production and distribution expenses of $5,455,000 increased 4.7% above the prior fiscal year primarily due to increases in fulfillment restructuring costs and an increase in paper costs, offset by decreases in production expenses to support the Company’s website and maintenance of the Company’s publishing and application software and operating systems.
30
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, production and distribution expenses of $5,211,000 increased 4.1% above the prior fiscal year. Increases in production support of the Company’s website and maintenance of the Company’s publishing and application software and operating systems were partially offset by lower paper and printing costs resulting from decreases in print circulation.
Office and administration
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, office and administrative expenses of $4,855,000 decreased 4.5% below the prior fiscal year, primarily because the Company did not have to incur restructuring costs for outsourcing VLDC's operations as in the previous fiscal year.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, office and administrative expenses of $5,085,000 increased 6.8% above the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs for outsourcing VLDC’s operations.

Lease Commitments
On November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated (“ABM” or the “Sublandlord”) commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied against the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters.
From 2016 to 2024, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”). Base rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which has been fully refunded after the Company vacated the premises. VLDC distributed Value Line’s print publications from the Warehouse. The Company has outsourced to U.S. contractors the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse.

During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, the Company’s total investment gains of $3,238,000 increased 17.1% above prior fiscal year, primarily derived from unrealized gains on equity securities and increases in the interest income. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024 were $3,243,000 and $1,129,000, respectively. There were no capital gain distributions from ETFs in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company’s total investment gains of $2,764,000 increased 135.4% above prior fiscal year, primarily derived from unrealized gains on equity securities and increases in the interest income. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023 were $1,129,000 and $4,706,000, respectively. There were no capital gain distributions from ETFs in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.
Effective income tax rate
The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023 were 24.89%, 24.50% and 24.00%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 as compared to April 30, 2024, is primarily a result of an increase in the state and local tax rate from 3.72% to 4.09%. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, changes in tax rates, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $56,230,000 as of April 30, 2025 and $48,770,000 as of April 30, 2024. These amounts include short-term unearned revenue of $16,558,000 and $15,764,000 reflected in total current liabilities at April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Cash and short-term securities were $77,391,000 and $68,345,000 as of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, respectively.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include $33,615,000 and $4,136,000 at April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, respectively, invested primarily in commercial banks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.
Cash from operating activities
The Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $20,243,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, compared to cash inflows from operations of $17,932,000 and $18,178,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in cash inflows was a result of an increase in cash receipts, EAM, publication subscription sales and a decrease in income tax payments offset by a decrease in cash receipts from customer accounts receivable from the same period last year.
32
Cash from investing activities
The Company’s cash inflows from investing activities of $21,200,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, compared to cash outflows from investing activities of $10,048,000 and cash outflows of $26,116,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively. The significant cash inflows in investing activities for the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 was a result of management’s conscious decisions to invest the proceeds from maturities of fixed income short-term securities in the Company’s short-term U.S. Government money market fund accounts at sometimes higher yields than U.S Treasury Bills.
Cash from financing activities
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, the Company’s cash outflows from financing activities were $11,756,000 and compared to cash outflows from financing activities of $11,084,000 and $14,175,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash outflows for financing activities included $453,000, $523,000 and $4,704,000 for the repurchase of 11,480 shares, 12,057 shares and 75,303 shares of the Company’s common stock under the May 2022 & October 2022 board approved common stock repurchase programs, during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.30 per share during fiscal 2025 aggregated $11,303,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.28 per share during fiscal 2024 aggregated $10,561,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.25 per share during fiscal 2023 aggregated $9,471,000.
At April 30, 2025 there were 9,417,097 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,428,379 common shares outstanding at April 30, 2024. The Company expects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Debt and Liquid Assets
Management believes that the Company’s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with future cash flows from operations and from the Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond next year. Management does not anticipate making any borrowings during the next twelve months. As of April 30, 2025, retained earnings and liquid assets were $113,400,000 and $77,391,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets were $104,249,000 and $68,345,000, respectively.
Seasonality
Our publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally seasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU 2023-07 with such disclosures included in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
33
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income- Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, requiring all public business entities to provide additional disclosure of the nature of expenses include in the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statement disclosures.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States (U.S. “GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements:
●
Valuation of EAM
Investment in EAM Trust
The Company accounts for its investment in EAM using the equity method of accounting. A specialized valuation firm annually prepares an evaluation of the EAM business, permitting the Company to determine that the valuation of our investment is not impaired. Based on this evaluation by the firm engaged by EAM, EAM determines if there is other-than-temporary impairment in its investment. The Company uses the report information for a similar purpose.
Should the fair value of the investment fall below its carrying value, the Company will determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company will write down the investment to its fair value. Since the inception of EAM, the Company has not recognized any other-than-temporary impairment in the investment.
Contractual Obligations
We are a party to lease contracts which will result in cash payments to lessors in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next four fiscal years (in thousands): $1,461 in 2026; $1,493 in 2027 and $882 in 2028 totaling $3,836.
34
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Market Risk Disclosures
The Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company’s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company’s investment activities.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company’s management invests primarily in short-term obligations maturing within one year.
The fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.
Fixed income securities consist of certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States. As of April 30, 2025 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $22,518,000 and $22,435,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $47,931,000 and $47,611,000, respectively.
The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.

Management regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company’s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated with changes in interest rates.
35
Equity Price Risk
The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.
The Company’s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes and ETFs that hold preferred shares primarily of financial institutions. In order to maintain liquidity in these securities, the Company’s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5% of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue.
As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY), other Exchange Traded Funds and common stock equity securities was a combined total $15,513,000 and $11,663,000, respectively, and the fair value was $20,879,000 and $16,344,000, respectively.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of April 30, 2025, as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer are engaged in a comprehensive effort to review, evaluate and improve the Company's controls; however, management does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls or its internal controls over financial reporting can prevent all possible errors and fraud.
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Under applicable SEC rules, no such attestation report by the Company's registered public accounting firm is required.
Changes in Internal Controls
In the course of the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer considered certain internal control areas in which the Company has made and is continuing to make changes to improve and enhance controls. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer of the Company concluded that there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
(b)
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
38
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President & Treasurer, acting as Principal Financial Officer, the Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control systems over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.
Value Line has never adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as that term is defined in Item 408(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K). None of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during fiscal year ended April 30, 2025.

Procedures for Shareholders to Nominate Directors
There have been no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders of the Company may recommend nominees to the Company's Board of Directors.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Forms 3, 4 and 5 they file.
Based on the Company's review of the copies of such forms that it has received and written representations from certain reporting persons confirming that they were not required to file Forms 5 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, the Company believes that all its executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders complied with applicable SEC filing requirements during fiscal 2025.

During the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the Company was reimbursed $356,000 and $364,000, respectively for payments it made on behalf of and services it provided to AB&Co. There were no receivables due from the Parent at April 30, 2025 or April 30, 2024. In addition, a tax-sharing arrangement allocates the tax liabilities of the two companies between them. The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by AB&Co. The Company pays to AB&Co. an amount equal to the Company's liability as if it filed a separate federal income tax return. For the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company made payments to AB&Co. for federal income taxes amounting to $5,058,000 and $5,448,000, respectively.
The Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from 41% to 55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from the Value Line Mutual Funds and separate accounts business, and 50% of EAM’s net profits.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the Company recorded income of $18,318,000 and $13,282,000, respectively, consisting of $16,183,000 and $11,900,000, from its non-voting revenues interest in EAM and $2,135,000 and $1,382,000, from its non-voting profits interest in EAM without incurring any directly related expenses.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, the Company recorded income of $11,131,000, consisting of $10,397,000, from its non-voting revenues interest in EAM and $734,000, from its non-voting profits interest in EAM without incurring any directly related expenses.
Included in the Company’s Investment in EAM Trust are receivables due from EAM of $4,493,000 and $3,865,000 at April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, respectively, for the unpaid portion of Value Line’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests. The non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests due from EAM are payable to Value Line quarterly under the provisions of the EAM Declaration of Trust.
The Company has adopted a written Related Party Transactions Policy as part of its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  This policy requires that any related party transaction which would be required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of Value Line, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Value Line, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
49
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Investment in Unconsolidated Entity
As described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the equity method of accounting to report its investment in its unconsolidated entity. As of April 30, 2025, the carrying value of the investment was $60,807,000.  On an annual basis, management performs an impairment assessment to ensure that the carrying value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity is properly reflected.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to such assessment is a critical audit matter are that there were significant judgements made by management in estimating the fair value of the investment and the fact that management utilized a specialist to assist in its determination of fair value. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity, and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimation of the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, including management’s assessment of the unconsolidated entity’s financial condition and results of operations.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included, among others, reviewing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model, and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management.
/s/ Horowitz & Ullmann, P.C.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

Value Line, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1-Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Value Line, Inc. ("Value Line" or "VLI", and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of New York.  The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. The Company maintains a significant investment in Eulav Asset Management LLC ("EAM")  from which it receives a non-voting revenues interest  and a non-voting profits interest.  Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust dated as of December 23, 2010 (the "EAM Trust Agreement"), VLI granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and agreed to supply, without charge or expense, the Value Line Proprietary Ranking System information to EAM for use in managing the Value Line Funds. EAM was established to provide investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds" or the "Funds").
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation:
The Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Topic 810 “Consolidation” to determine if it should consolidate its investment in a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A VIE is a legal entity in which either (i) equity investors do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to enable the entity to finance its activities independently or (ii) the equity holders at risk lack the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns or the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance.  A holder of a variable interest in a VIE is required to consolidate the entity if it is determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary. The determination of a controlling financial interest in a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment to identify the variable interest holder, if any, that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The accounting guidance requires the Company to perform an ongoing assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE (see Note 5).
In accordance with FASB's Topic 810, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest have been consolidated.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds a significant non-voting revenues interest (excluding distribution revenues) and a significant non-voting profits interest in EULAV Asset Management, a Delaware statutory trust (“EAM” or “EAM Trust”). The Company relied on the guidance in FASB's ASC Topics 323 and 810 in its determination not to consolidate its investment in EAM and to account for such investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company reports the amount it earns for its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests as a separate line item below operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue Recognition:
Depending upon the product, subscription fulfillment for Value Line periodicals and related publications is available in print or digitally, via internet access. The length of a subscription varies by product and offer received by the subscriber.  Generally, subscriptions are offered as annual subscriptions with the majority of subscriptions paid in advance. Subscription revenues, net of discounts, are recognized ratably on a straight line basis when the product is served to the client over the life of the subscription. Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheets are shown as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.
Copyright fees are derived from providing certain Value Line trademarks and the Value Line Proprietary Ranks to third parties under written agreements for use in selecting securities for third party marketed products, including unit investment trusts, annuities and exchange traded funds ("ETFs"). The Company earns asset-based copyright fees upon delivery to the customer as specified in the individual agreements.  Revenue is recognized monthly and received either quarterly or in advance over the term of the agreement and, because it is asset-based, will fluctuate as the market value of the underlying portfolio increases or decreases in value.
EAM earns investment management fees from the Value Line Funds. The management fees and average daily net assets for the Value Line Funds are calculated by State Street Bank, which serves as the fund accountant, fund administrator, and custodian of the Value Line Funds.
The Value Line Funds are open-end management companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). Shareholder transactions for the Value Line Funds are processed each business day by the third party transfer agent of the Funds. Shares can be redeemed without advance notice upon request of the shareowners each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open.
56
Investment in Unconsolidated Entities:
The Company accounts for its investment in its unconsolidated entity, EAM, using the equity method of accounting in accordance with FASB’s ASC 323. The equity method is an appropriate means of recognizing increases or decreases measured by GAAP in the economic resources underlying the investments. Under the equity method, an investor recognizes its share of the earnings or losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements rather than in the period in which an investee declares a dividend or distribution. An investor adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings or losses recognized by the investee.
The Company’s “interests” in EAM, the investment adviser to and the sole member of the distributor of the Value Line Funds, consist of a "non-voting revenues interest" and a "non-voting profits interest" in EAM as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement.  The non-voting revenues interest entitles the Company to receive a range of 41% to 55%, based on the amount of EAM’s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues (“Revenues Interest”).  The non-voting profits interest entitles the Company to receive 50% of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement (“Profits Interest”). The Revenues Interest and at least 90% of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line. The Company's Revenues Interest in EAM excludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities. The Company reflects its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company does not have control over the operating and financial policies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's revenues and profits.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU 2023-07 with such disclosures included in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income- Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, requiring all public business entities to provide additional disclosure of the nature of expenses include in the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statement disclosures.
Valuation of Securities:
The Company's securities classified as cash equivalents, equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities consist of shares of money market funds that invest primarily in short-term U.S. Government securities, investments in equities including ETFs and fixed income securities invested primarily in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, and to a smaller extent bank certificates of deposit that are valued in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB's ASC 820. The securities classified as equity securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income per FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 ("ASU 2016-01"). The securities classified as available-for-sale  fixed income securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investment gains and losses on sales of the equity securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Investment gains and losses on sales of the available-for-sale fixed income securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the cost of the securities. Investment gains and losses on sales of all securities are recorded in earnings as of the trade date and are determined on the identified cost method.
The Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that it has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise.
Market valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market value of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices. Cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.
57
The Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The Fair Value Measurements Topic established a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks include those inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are classified as observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
The following summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of the Company’s investments:

The Company had no other financial instruments such as futures, forwards and swap contracts. For the periods ended April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, there were no Level 3 investments. The Company does not have any liabilities subject to fair value measurement.
Advertising expenses:
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
Income Taxes:
The Company computes its income tax provision in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated  Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17, Income taxes (Topic 740) and classifies all deferred taxes as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC establishes for all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. As of April 30, 2025, management has reviewed the tax positions for the years still subject to tax audit under the statute of limitations, evaluated the implications, and determined that there is no material impact to the Company's financial statements.
Earnings per share:
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Any shares that are reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they are outstanding. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive common shares from outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.
58
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short-term liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash and cash equivalents. As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, cash equivalents included $33,615,000 and $4,136,000, respectively, for amounts invested in  money market mutual funds that invest in short-term U.S. government securities.

Note 3 - Related Party Transactions:
Investment Management (overview):
The Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and receives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below.
Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2025, were $4.68 billion, which is $0.51 billion, or 12.0%, above total assets of $4.17 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024.
The Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line’s percent share of EAM’s revenues is calculated each fiscal quarter.
The non-voting revenues and 90% of the Company's non-voting profits interests due from EAM to the Company are payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. The distributable amounts earned through the balance sheet date, which is included in the Investment in EAM Trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and not yet paid, were $4,493,000 and $3,865,000 at April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, respectively.
EAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests:
The Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from 41% to 55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entities:
Equity Method Investment:
As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024, the Company's investment in EAM Trust, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $60,807,000 and $60,134,000, respectively.
The value of VLI’s investment in EAM at April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024 reflects the fair value of contributed capital of $55,805,000 at inception, which included $5,820,000 of cash and liquid securities in excess of working capital requirements contributed to EAM’s capital account by VLI, plus VLI's share of non-voting revenues and non-voting profits from EAM less distributions, made quarterly to VLI by EAM, during the period subsequent to its initial investment through the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
It is anticipated that EAM will have sufficient liquidity and earn enough profit to conduct its current and future operations so the management of EAM will not need additional funding.
The Company monitors its Investment in EAM Trust for impairment to determine whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.  Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and regulatory requirements. EAM did not record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years 2025 or 2024.

Note 5 - Variable Interest Entity:
The Company holds a  non-voting revenues interest and a 50% non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses. EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company. The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on a qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate and pass through to holders of variable interests. Other than EAM, the Company does not have an interest in any other VIEs.
The Company has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most significantly impact its economic performance. Value Line does not hold any voting stock of EAM and it does not have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or operations of EAM. Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the activities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does not maintain control over EAM.
In addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to variability based on EAM’s operations risk, Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits interest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests.
The Company has not provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line has no obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has no exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed revenues and profits interests retained in EAM. The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as well as the value of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.

On December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), was enacted. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate ("Federal Tax Rate") from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of 21% in fiscal year 2019 and each year thereafter.
The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023 were 24.89%, 24.50% and 24.00%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2025 as compared to April 30, 2024, is primarily a result of an increase in the state and local tax rate from 3.72% to 4.09%. The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to April 30, 2023, is primarily a result of an increase in the state and local tax rate from 3.25% to 3.72%. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, changes in tax rates, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.

Deferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows:

The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability is primarily a result of the federal, state and local taxes related to the $50,805,000 gain from deconsolidation of the Company's asset management and mutual fund distribution subsidiaries, partially offset by the long-term tax benefit related to the non-cash post-employment compensation of $1,770,000 granted to VLI's former employee.
The Company uses the effective income tax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and certain other discrete events in the period in which they occur.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income as a result of the following:

The Company believes that, as of April 30, 2025, there were no material uncertain tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP.
The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent. The Company has a tax sharing agreement which requires it to make tax payments to the Parent equal to the Company's liability/(benefit) as if it filed a separate return. Beginning with the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company files combined income tax returns with the Parent on a unitary basis in certain states as a result of changes in state tax regulations.
The Company’s federal income tax returns (included in the Parent’s consolidated returns) and state and city tax returns for fiscal years ended 2021 through 2023, are subject to examination by the tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed with the tax authorities.
Note 8 - Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan:
Substantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are members of the Value Line, Inc. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the "Plan"). In general, this is a qualified, contributory plan which provides for a discretionary annual Company contribution which is determined by a formula based on the salaries of eligible employees and the amount of consolidated net operating income as defined in the Plan. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the estimated profit sharing plan contribution, which is included as an expense in salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $422,000, $411,000 and $410,000, respectively.

Note 9 - Lease Commitments:
On November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value Line, Inc.  and ABM Industries, Incorporated (“ABM” or the “Sublandlord”) commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first six months of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied against the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.
On February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on April 30, 2024 (“Lease”).  Base rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which has been fully refunded. VLDC distributed Value Line’s print publications. The Company has outsourced to a U.S. facility the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognizes in the statements of financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in May 2019 under a modified retrospective approach.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU 2018-11, which provides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. May 1, 2019). The Company has elected to employ the transitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or expired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized.
The Company leases office space in New York, NY. The Company has evaluated that lease and determined that it is an operating lease under the definitions of the guidance of ASU 2016-02.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the net present value of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the net present value of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.
On May 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of $9,575,000, which represents the lease liability of $10,340,000 adjusted for previously recorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of $765,000. The right-of-use asset will be amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the difference between the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of April 30, 2025, the Company had a long-term lease asset of $3,037,000, solely related to our NYC headquarters, located at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY, recorded in property and equipment in its consolidated balance sheets. The VLDC lease at 205 Chubb Avenue, Lyndhurst, NJ ended on April 30, 2024.
The Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense are presented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. For the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, the Company recognized $1,276,000 in lease expense.
For the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, the Company paid $1,428,000 in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the $1,428,000 will be classified within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
65
The Company’s lease does not provide an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the commencement date, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC 842 as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2025:

Note 10 - Disclosure of Credit Risk of Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:
Other than EAM and the Value Line Funds as explained in Note 3 - Related Party Transactions, a single customer accounted for a significant portion of the Company's sales in fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023, and its accounts receivable as of April 30, 2025 or 2024.  During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, 29.6%, 32.2% and 33.9%, respectively, of total publishing revenues were derived from a single customer as explained in Note 16 - Concentration.
Note 11 - Comprehensive Income:
The FASB's ASC Comprehensive Income topic requires the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations.  Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that otherwise would not be recognized in the calculation of net income.
As of April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2024 the Company held fixed income securities consisting of securities issued by federal, state, and local governments within the United States that are classified as securities available-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in valuation of fixed income securities, net of deferred income taxes, has been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 12 - Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use:
The Company has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1 (SOP 98-1), "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use". SOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize as long-lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or purchasing software for internal use and amortize those costs over the software's estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner. Such costs, when incurred, are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset, normally 3 to 5 years.
During the twelve months ended April 30, 2025, the Company capitalized $59,000 related to the third party programmers' costs. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company capitalized $62,000 related to the third party programmers' costs. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, the Company capitalized $110,000 related to the third party programmers' costs. Total amortization expenses for the years ended April 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $128,000, $62,000 and $49,000, respectively.
Note 13 - Treasury Stock and Repurchase Program:
On October 21, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock up to an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, in block purchases or otherwise. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion and has no set expiration date. There is a remainder of $758,000 before the authorized limit is reached.

Note 17 - Concentration of Credit Risk:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. At April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had $1,944,000 and $1,419,000, respectively, in excess of the FDIC insured limit. Management has concluded the excess does not represent a material risk, based on the creditworthiness of the counter parties.
The Company maintains a deposit account of $305,000 at Flagstar Bank as security for a letter of credit in a similar amount (See Note 15).
Note 18 - Business Segments:
The Company allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis. It does so because significant costs, predominately including the Research Department, Information Technology Department, and Occupancy Overhead, are shared in common by all products. Therefore, the investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the embedded Proprietary information and intellectual property rights, are treated as one segment, Publishing.
The products and services offered by the Company generally fall into four categories:
•
Comprehensive reference periodical publications
•
Targeted, niche periodical newsletters
•
Investment analysis software
•
Current and historical financial databases
The comprehensive research services (The Value Line Investment Survey, The Value Line Investment Survey – Small and Mid-Cap, The Value Line 600, and The Value Line Fund Advisor Plus) provide both statistical and text coverage of a large number of investment securities, with an emphasis placed on Value Line’s proprietary research, analysis and statistical ranks.
The niche newsletters (Value Line Select ®, Value Line Select: Dividend Income & Growth, Value Line Select: ETFs, The Value Line Special Situations Service®, The Value Line M&A Service, The Value Line Climate Change Investing Service, and The Value Line Information You Should Know Wealth Newsletter) provide information on a less comprehensive basis for securities that the Company believes will be of particular interest to subscribers and may include topics of interest on market and the business environment.
Investment analysis software (The Value Line Investment Analyzer and The Value Line ETFs Service) includes data sorting and filtering tools. In addition, for institutional and professional subscribers, the Company offers current and historical financial databases (DataFile, Estimates & Projections, and Mutual Funds) via the Internet.
The Company’s available copyright services, which include certain proprietary Ranking System results and other proprietary information are made available for use in third party products, such as unit investment trusts, variable annuities, managed accounts and exchange traded funds.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer. The financial measures used by the CODM to assess segment performance and allocate resources on a company-wide basis are revenues, operating expenses, income from operations, and net income.
The CODM uses available sales, revenue, and expense information primarily to evaluate whether changes are indicated in expenses including advertising, salaries and benefits, and print production, and whether changes in expenses would be likely to cause improvement in revenues, profits, or backlogs of business.
Significant segment revenues include investment periodicals and related publications and copyright fees. Significant segment expenses include advertising and promotion, salaries and employee benefits, production and distribution and office and administration. Other segment items included in consolidated net income consist of revenues and profits interest in EAM Trust and investment gains. Significant segment revenues, segment expenses, and other segment items are presented in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
All required segment financial information can be found directly in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 1.
Value Line’s customers are almost exclusively located within the United States. It receives approximately 2% of its revenues from external customers located outside of the United States.
As described in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company deconsolidated its investment management business in December 2010 and therefore no longer reports the investment management operation as a separate business unit. Although VLI continues to receive significant cash flows from these operations through its non-controlling investment in EAM, it no longer considers this to be a reportable business segment because it does not satisfy one of the required characteristics of an operating segment pursuant to ASC 280-10-50-1. Specifically, VLI’s Chief Executive Officer does not regularly review EAM’s operating results to make decisions about resources to be allocated to EAM.
