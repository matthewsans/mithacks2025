We design innovative solutions to treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives. Our digital health technologies and cloud-connected medical devices transform care for people with sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and other chronic diseases. Our comprehensive residential care software platforms support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. By enabling better care, our products improve quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease, and lower costs for consumers and healthcare systems.Following our formation in 1989, we commercialized a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, which was the first successful non-invasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Since the development of CPAP, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broad range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, and dental devices.

Corporate HistoryOur Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Pty Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter‚Äôs existing CPAP device business. Baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold CPAP devices in Australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business.ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries. In June 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market. In September 1999, we transferred our principal listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúRMD‚Äù. In November 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDIs, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol ‚ÄúRMD‚Äù. Ten CDIs on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE. Since formation, we have grown organically through global expansion as well as by acquiring a number of businesses, including distributors, suppliers, developers of medical equipment and related technologies, and software solution providers.Segment Information We operate in two segments, which are the Sleep and Breathing Health segment and Residential Care Software segment. See Note 13 ‚Äì Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.The MarketWe are focused on sleep and related breathing health, both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated, and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers, help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs. Additionally, our software solutions are focused on those who provide residential care, which we believe is fragmented and underserved, and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve residential healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across residential care settings.-2-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSleep and Breathing HealthSleepSleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into three stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 3 is the deepest.The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide, signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.A long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults aged 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. Another study published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine in 2019 estimated that mild to severe OSA impacts more than 936 million people worldwide, including 54 million Americans. Of those impacted globally, it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated in the U.S., and 10% or less in other markets. Many healthcare professionals often do not diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, hypertension, and irritability are characteristic of OSA.While sleep apnea has been diagnosed in a small portion of a broad cross-section of the population, until recently it has most frequently been diagnosed among middle-aged men with obesity. However, we believe the importance of sleep apnea in women is increasingly being recognized, with nearly 40% of new PAP patients being female. Among all patients, a strong association has been discovered between sleep apnea and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that sleep apnea is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 77% of patients with obesity, approximately 76% of patients with chronic heart failure, and approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes.A study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in 2021 and later published in CHEST in 2022 found that using PAP therapy as directed can significantly increase sleep apnea patients‚Äô chances of living longer. The study concluded that people with obstructive sleep apnea who started and continued PAP therapy were 39% more likely to survive over a three-year period than OSA patients who did not. Researchers found that the survival rate gap remained significant when accounting for patients‚Äô ages, overall health, other pre-existing conditions, and causes of death.Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Sleep-disordered breathing, or SDB, encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease, and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression, and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies demonstrate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke, and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem- solving, response speed, and visual motor coordination; studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.-3-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESGenerally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient‚Äôs home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our ApneaLink Air, NightOwl, or our automatic PAP devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas, or subconscious awakenings. Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient‚Äôs windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and streamline the shape of the airway or implant a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods. Consequently, surgical treatments are not considered first-line therapy for OSA. Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices, and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles. Recently, pharmaceutical therapy treatments have been cleared for the treatment of OSA and others are reportedly under development.A variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective. CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasingly used as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway. CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board, and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with an interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.CPAP is not a cure and, therefore, must be used nightly as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the effectiveness of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In recent years, we have developed product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually increase air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including our AirCurve 11 Series devices, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and auto-titration devices that modulate the average pressure delivered during the night. We also offer myAir, a patient engagement application that provides sleep data and a daily score based on a user's previous night‚Äôs data to improve compliance. Breathing HealthOur aim is to provide breathing health solutions to patients with COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or OHS, and neuromuscular disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We aim to improve patient quality of life, slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management.Our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life support. Our devices are predominantly used in the home and, to a lesser extent, in general hospital wards and respiratory wards. We supply CPAP and bilevel device systems, high flow therapy device systems (HFT), non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers, and accessories, including masks, nasal cannula, headgear, and tubing. We also provide data management systems designed to improve the management of patients by care providers.-4-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs. It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways. Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. A recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 480 million people worldwide who suffer from COPD, the world‚Äôs third leading cause of death.Patients with COPD can have different clinical presentations. Patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen (hypoxemia) and elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia), a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale, and commonly have excess weight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity. During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia. In general, the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep. Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep. Some COPD patients may also suffer from comorbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome.Home non-invasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe COPD by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions. Early research also suggests that home HFT may help improve clinical outcomes in hypoxemic COPD patients that frequently have exacerbations.Overlap Syndrome. In patients with COPD-OSA Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange. Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing. It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with stable COPD, the advantages of home NIV are less clear, but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and health-related quality-of-life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays.Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. OHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sleep apnea after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. An estimated 90% of patients with OHS also have OSA. In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, with either CPAP or NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive. Neuromuscular Disease. Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration, and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness, and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly. Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years. Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy. NIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases. In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival. Studies have demonstrated that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with NIV treatment.Residential Care SoftwareOur Residential Care Software business provides cloud-based solutions to healthcare providers operating in the residential care market, including HME and home infusion providers, home health and hospice providers, skilled nursing facilities, private duty nursing organizations, senior living facilities, and life plan communities.

Our Residential Care Software offerings are designed to support customers in addressing these challenges by helping providers perform analytics, manage documentation and implement new -5-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESreimbursement requirements as well as more effectively transfer data as patients move between different care settings. Our Residential Care Software platforms include capabilities for billing and business management, electronic medical records, revenue cycle management, operational analytics, patient engagement, and workforce management. Business StrategyWe envision a world where every person can achieve their full potential through better sleep and breathing, with care delivered in their own home. We believe the sleep and breathing treatments will continue to grow due to a number of factors, including increasing awareness of OSA, CSA and COPD; improved understanding of the role of sleep apnea treatment in the management of adjacent pathologies; improved understanding of the role of bilevel therapy and non-invasive ventilation in the management of COPD; and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of sleep and breathing health markets, as well as growth in residential care settings, consists of the following key elements: ‚Ä¢Grow and Differentiate Our Core Sleep Apnea Portfolio. We are the leader in developing smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected products. We aim to continue differentiating our products by integrating artificial‚Äëintelligence and machine‚Äëlearning, or AI and ML, algorithms to further enhance therapy performance and user experience. Sleep is becoming a more important aspect of our customers' lives, and we intend to drive higher rates of screening, diagnosis, and therapy adoption through simpler care pathways. In April 2025, we made our home sleep apnea test, NightOwl, available across the U.S., providing a simplified, accurate, and efficient way to diagnose OSA from the comfort of an individual‚Äôs home. In May 2025, we acquired VirtuOx, an IDTF, to expand our ability to partner with healthcare providers to help streamline the diagnostic process, while expanding collaboration with home medical equipment providers to efficiently support patients to start treatment.‚Ä¢Accelerate Market Growth through Awareness. We continue to expand our existing educational activities to increase awareness of sleep apnea, COPD, and other clinical conditions that can be treated with our industry-leading solutions. These activities target both the population predisposed to sleep apnea and medical specialists, such as pulmonologists, sleep medicine specialists, primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, and other medical subspecialists who treat these conditions and their associated comorbidities. We target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, COPD Foundation, and the National Sleep Foundation, to further increase awareness of the relationship between OSA, COPD, neuromuscular disease, and comorbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The programs also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. We have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the University of California, San Diego, in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD. We have also established a chair for the study of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. ‚Ä¢Capitalize on Broader Sleep and Breathing Health Adjacencies. Our evolution is designed to capitalize on key macro trends, including the enhanced spotlight on sleep apnea due to pharmaceuticals and consumer technology. Through our brand leadership and expertise, we are positioned to serve large, unmet needs in insomnia, COPD and other respiratory and related conditions. Research supported by Resmed has demonstrated that the addition of non-invasive ventilation to patients with severe COPD who are receiving oxygen therapy provides meaningful clinical benefits to the patient and the broader healthcare system. We are committed to ongoing innovation of our breathing health products, providing advanced and expanded integrations of our therapy-based software solutions, including AirView, enabling clinicians to remotely monitor patients on some ventilation devices and bilevel devices. Additionally, studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and chronic heart failure and have recognized sleep apnea as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that sleep apnea is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We maintain close working relationships with prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology.‚Ä¢Invest in an Integrated, Intelligent Digital‚ÄëHealth Ecosystem Delivered at Home. Digital enablement is central to our strategy.

Across the sleep and breathing health platforms, we support clinical trials in many countries including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Argentina, Chile, China, Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology. We also continue to support some of the largest sleep apnea studies in history by performing advanced statistical analyses on millions of real-world, de-identified, clinical data points collected through our cloud-connected devices and patient engagement tools. These studies provide clinical insights around patient management, device settings, and predictors of patient adherence that inform our product development efforts. Some of the more recent real-world studies point to a link between PAP adherence and reduced mortality among patients with OSA.We consult with physicians at major medical centers throughout the world to identify clinical and technological trends in the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD, and the other conditions associated with these diseases. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, and clinicians.Sales and Marketing We currently market our products in more than 140 countries through a network of distributors and direct sales staff. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each major geography, often based on regional awareness of sleep apnea as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences, and local reimbursement policies. See Note 13 ‚Äì Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas.United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our products are typically purchased by a HME provider who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: prescribing practitioners; HME providers; insurers (both private and public); and patients. In the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our field sales organization markets and sells products to HME provider branch locations throughout the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. We also directly educate physicians and sleep clinics about our products. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a HME provider to fill the prescription. The HME provider, in consultation with the referring practitioner, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level. Our Residential Care Software solutions are sold to providers of healthcare in various residential care settings. We market and sell our Brightree business management software and service solutions to providers in the U.S. Our primary markets are HME, pharmacy, home infusion, orthotics and prosthetics. Our sales activities for Brightree products are conducted through an employee sales organization made up of strategic account managers, sales engineers and sales directors. We develop, market, and sell our MatrixCare care management and related ancillary solutions to providers in the U.S. and our primary customers are senior living; skilled nursing; life plan communities; home health, home care, and hospice agencies as well as related accountable care organizations. Our MatrixCare management solutions are primarily sold through direct sales and ancillary solutions are sold both through direct sales and channel sellers.Combined Europe, Asia, and other markets. We market our products in most major countries in combined Europe, Asia and other geographies. We have wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in combined Europe, Asia, and other regions. We select independent distributors in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to treatment of sleep apnea with our therapy. In countries where we sell our products directly, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In many countries, we sell our products to HME providers or hospitals who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, Australia, New -10-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESZealand, and South Korea, we also operate home healthcare businesses, providing products and services directly to patients through a vertically integrated network. We only sell our Residential Care Software products in the U.S. and Germany. Manufacturing We operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed to optimize quality, control costs, reduce time to market for new product introduction, and generate supply chain resilience. Our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as technical assembly and comprehensive testing and quality control of our devices, masks, and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, many are available from multiple vendors. We also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. Any reduction or halt in supply from one of these suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. We strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver year-on-year improvement in quality, availability and value. Each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback. Resmed's supply chain may be impacted by periodic transport disruptions and supply constraints on certain raw materials and electronic components, including semiconductor chips and magnets. Such disruptions or constraints impact our ability to manufacture products in quantities and in the time necessary to satisfy global customer demand, which could negatively impact our results of operations.Further, we source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Changes to trade policy, including tariff measures introduced in February 2025, may drive new inflation risks in our supply chain for these components and materials. On April 5, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a Notice of Implementation confirming that current tariff relief for products like ours continues. The current impact of global tariffs is dynamic, however. If reciprocal tariffs go into widespread effect, they could have a material impact on our business and financial statements through interruption of supply chains, increases in our costs as our suppliers deal with an uncertain global trade environment or an increase or disruption of global shipping. Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 13485, Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Quality System Regulation, or QSR, being replaced by the new FDA Quality Management System Regulation, or QMSR, effective February 2, 2026, European Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our main manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and are audited at regular intervals by a Notified Body. Additionally, our Sydney, Tuas, San Diego, Atlanta, and Moreno Valley sites are certified under the Medical Device Single Audit Program or MDSAP, an audit of medical device manufacturers‚Äô quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements. MDSAP audits are conducted by a MDSAP recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the U.S.). Our Sydney and Singapore manufacturing operations operate an Environmental Management System (EMS) certified to ISO 14001:2015. We are progressively extending the EMS across our manufacturing network.Our main manufacturing facilities for Resmed-branded products are located in Tuas, Singapore; Sydney, Australia; Chatsworth, California; Calabasas, California; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; and Atlanta, Georgia. The principal factory for our Curative-branded products is in Suzhou, China. Our Narval-branded products are manufactured in Lyon, France. Refer to Item 2 for additional details on these properties. We will continue to expand and balance volume across our network to meet scale, cost, resilience, and environmental performance objectives, and to meet the needs of customers and patients.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementThe cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany and Korea, we receive payments directly from these payors. While we do not generally receive direct payments for our products from payors in other countries, our success largely depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from those payors. -11-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESIn the U.S., our products are purchased primarily by HME providers, health systems, or sleep clinics, who invoice third-party payors directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that specific defined coverage criteria are not met or that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, or not deemed reasonable and necessary. Additionally, our recent acquisition of VirtuOx will now require us to bill both commercial and governmental payors in the U.S. for diagnostic testing and interpretation services. As an IDTF, VirtuOx is subject to various enrollment, coverage and billing requirements by Medicare, state Medicaid Programs, other governmental payors, and commercial health insurance plans. Payors may deny coverage and reimbursement for VirtuOx‚Äôs services if they determine that specific defined coverage criteria are not met or that the services are not medically necessary. VirtuOx experiences frequent government payor audits and while we believe that our billing is appropriate, such audits incur business expenses and decisions may not always be favorable.The long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products and services. In some countries, such as France, Germany, and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for the purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia, China, and some other countries, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA. Healthcare reform in the U.S. continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) competitive bidding program, which included durable medical equipment purchasers of our CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), and related supplies and accessories. Under the program, DMEPOS suppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by submitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). The lower payment amounts resulting from the competition may replace the Medicare fee schedule amounts for the bid items in these areas. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years and to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices. The implementation of the competitive bidding program has resulted in reduced Medicare payment for CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and non-competitive bidding areas.The last round of competitive bid contracts lapsed, effective January 1, 2019. CMS then removed 13 product categories, including CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), from the Round 2021 Competitive Bidding Program competition. As a result, these products are currently subject to a temporary gap period during which any Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS suppliers may furnish DMEPOS items and services to patients. Payment for Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS suppliers in former CBAs is based on 100% of the single payment amount, for the CBA increased by the projected percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from January 2023 to January 2024. The temporary gap period for all DMEPOS CBPs has recently ended with the announcement of new regulations reinstating competitive bidding in the U.S. As a consequence, we expect that CMS will initiate the next round of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program after the agency completes the formal public notice and comment rulemaking process. For items furnished in non-CBAs, fees are based on fully-adjusted rates per the applicable methodology under Code of Federal Regulations Title 42 414.210 (g).Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 but were subject to a temporary suspension. The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers From Sequester Cuts Act was signed into law December 10, 2021. The law extended the 2% Medicare sequester moratorium through March 31, 2022, adjusted the sequester to 1% between April 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022, and reinstated the full 2% sequestration cut which began on July 1, 2022 and continues until further notice. The payment reduction applicable to healthcare providers applies to the approved Medicare payment amount, after the deductible and coinsurance are applied. The reduction in payment does not affect the 20% coinsurance owed by the patient. The sequestration order covers all payments for services with dates of service on or after July 1, 2022. On March 9, 2024, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, -12-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESwhich included a 2.93% update to the CY 2024 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Conversion Factor (CF) for dates of service March 9 through December 31, 2024. This replaced the 1.25% update provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. On November 1, 2024, CMS issued a rule finalizing changes for Medicare payments under the PFS and other Medicare Part B policies, effective on or after January 1, 2025. Under this final rule, the average payment rates under the PFS would be reduced by 2.93% in CY 2025, removing the temporary increase in payment for CY 2024. This amounts to an estimated CY 2025 PFS conversion factor of $32.35, a decrease of $0.94 from the CY 2024 conversion factor of $33.29, resulting in lower Medicare payments to Part B suppliers. As discussed immediately below, however, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a 1-year, 2.5% increase to the PFS for 2026, which temporarily addresses the 2025 payment cuts.Most recently, on July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the Bill), which among other things, cuts federal Medicaid funding by $930 billion over ten years but provides reimbursement rate increases for providers. Notably, however, the Bill is projected to increase the federal deficit, which may lead to mandatory Medicare cuts and reduction in payments to providers in the future. The Bill also makes changes to the ACA that could reduce enrollment, including shortening enrollment periods and eliminating automatic re-enrollment. Additionally, in 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, proposed an adjustment through regulation to amend the previously adopted schedule of VA ratings for sleep apnea. Specifically, the proposed rule would remove in its entirety the current 30% disability rating for veterans exhibiting excessive daytime sleepiness and instead replacing it with a 10% disability rating for veterans with a sleep apnea diagnosis with incomplete relief (as determined by a sleep study) with treatment including a CPAP machine, and further, remove the automatic 50% disability rating for veterans with a documented need for a CPAP machine (50% disability would instead require that the veteran have a sleep apnea diagnosis with ineffective treatment, as determined by a sleep study, or who is unable to use treatment due to comorbid conditions, without end-organ damage). The VA has not yet changed its ratings criteria but it could happen in calendar year 2025. If the changes are implemented, veterans who were rated for sleep apnea before the change in criteria will be grandfathered and retain their rating. However, all veterans filing new claims on and after the change in ratings criteria would be evaluated under the new criteria. The VA has not yet adopted these changes to the disability ratings system for sleep apnea but should this proposal, or another similar proposal to limit disability ratings be adopted, fewer veterans may pursue treatment of sleep apnea using CPAP or more veterans would claim ineffective treatment with CPAP to obtain a higher rating. The legislative landscape is complex and changes with the influence of one party or the other. The Trump Administration has issued many executive orders and new policy initiatives in 2025, including those impacting the healthcare and life sciences industry. We expect that new legislation, agency rules, and policy changes, including potential changes to the ACA, Medicaid funding, and other healthcare reform measures including flow down impacts from the Bill, may be adopted in the future and may result in additional reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products and services. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.Service and Warranty We generally offer either one-year or two-year limited warranties on our devices. In some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty. Warranties on mask systems are typically 90 days. Our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement. We receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We record reserves for warranties and returns based on historical data. CompetitionGlobal competition for sales of our products and services is intense. We believe that the principal competitive factors are product features, value-added solutions, quality, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors. We compete in various geographies, each with different competitors, and some of our competitors are affiliates of our customers, which may make it difficult to compete with them. -13-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur primary Sleep and Breathing Health competitors include Philips BV; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; React Health Corporation; Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply Co., Ltd, and Lowenstein Medical SE & Co. KG plus regional and new-entrant manufacturers. Our products compete with surgical procedures, nerve stimulation devices, and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other sleep apnea-related respiratory conditions. The adoption of new pharmaceuticals to treat obesity, a typical comorbidity of OSA, could impact our ongoing or future sales. For example, injectable glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, weight loss drugs may lower the occurrence of obesity, eventually reducing the severity of OSA, if significant weight loss is maintained. Injectable weight loss drugs have been approved for treatment of OSA in patients with obesity and moderate to severe OSA and are being marketed by physicians and to consumers. Oral versions of these drugs are reportedly under development and may be approved for the treatment of OSA. The development of new or innovative drugs, procedures, devices, or alternative therapies by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.For our Residential Care Software business, competition is also intense, rapidly evolving, and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many of our customers use systems developed in-house to run their businesses. The development of new or innovative software solutions by others could result in our solutions becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.Any product developed by us will have to compete for market acceptance and sales. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products and solutions. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products and solutions, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes, and provide commercial supply of products and solutions to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our products with patents and other intellectual property. Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation We rely on a combination of patents, designs, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Some of these patents, patent applications, and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products. We believe the combination of these rights, in aggregate, are of material importance to each of our businesses. Through our various subsidiaries, as of the date of this report, we own or have licensed rights to approximately 10,000 pending, allowed or granted patents and designs globally. Patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change. Of our patents and designs, approximately 640 U.S. patents and designs and approximately 1,450 foreign patents and designs are due to expire in the next five years. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement asserted against us by others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. We have in the past, and may in the future, be required or choose to license patents and other intellectual property rights owned by other parties. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.Government Regulations FDAOur products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA QSR, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the U.S. and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, marking, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for our products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the U.S. are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to -14-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESprovide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device, certain modifications thereof, or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance, a premarket approval, or PMA, or a de novo approval, and pay a user fee, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device, as well as whether or not a similar or ‚Äúpredicate‚Äù device exists to support a 510(k) application. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device‚Äôs safety and effectiveness. Certain software products may also be classified as a medical device.Our devices currently marketed in the U.S. are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. Certain of our software products may be classified as medical devices requiring a pre-marketing clearance or approval while others may not be medical devices, are medical devices that are exempt from the 510(k) process, or will be commercialized under FDA‚Äôs current policy of enforcement discretion. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and may require clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is ‚Äúsubstantially equivalent‚Äù to a predecessor device that was (a) legally marketed in the U.S. before the 1976 Medical Device Amendments that established the 510(k) pathway or (b) brought to market after 1976 pursuant to the 510(k) pathway. Such a predecessor device is referred to as ‚Äúpredicate device.‚Äù Devices that do not have such a predicate are typically classified as Class III by default and are required to undergo the stringent PMA pathway that includes provision of clinical evidence and trials. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and require the submission of extensive performance and clinical information. However, a sponsor may apply to the FDA to reclassify devices that do not have predicates to Class I or II if the device is of low to moderate risk. If the FDA grants the application, such a device is termed a ‚Äúde novo‚Äù device and is evaluated through the somewhat more flexible de novo approval pathway. As a result, FDA clearance and approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. Finally, there may be instances where the products we sell as a result of an acquisition are subject to further FDA review and clearance.Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new clearance or approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device‚Äôs safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to exemption, clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies in the U.S. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant clearance or approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures comply with the FDA‚Äôs regulatory requirements. We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting or MDR requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to -15-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESa death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.Sales of medical devices and software outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. EEAIn the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, medical devices need to comply with specific requirements. These requirements were previously known as ‚ÄúEssential Requirements‚Äù under the former EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or MDD) and are now defined ‚ÄúGeneral Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)‚Äù under the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or MDR). While the requirements set forth in the MDR are generally consistent with those laid out in the MDD (with a few exceptions), the GSPR are described more in detail compared to the Essential Requirements. Compliance with the Essential Requirements (under the MDD) or the GSPR (under the MDR) is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE marking to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements/GSPR and affix the CE marking, manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements/GSPR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is a third-party organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements/GSPR. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE marking to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements/GSPR must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under the MDR, incidents must be reported centrally in the European EUDAMED database (although transitional provisions are in place until EUDAMED is fully functional), and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to prevent or reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use. The MDR considers ‚Äúserious incidents‚Äù those incidents which, directly or indirectly, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons, a serious deterioration in their state of health, or a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. Where appropriate, our products commercialized in Europe are CE marked and classified as either Class I or Class II. -16-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the MDR, which repeals and replaces the MDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR), applicable as of May 26, 2022, provides for the regulatory framework applicable to in vitro diagnostic medical devices.The MDR was meant to become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow EEA national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date of application of the MDR by one year. The MDR thus became applicable on May 26, 2021. The MDR transitional provisions allow the placing on the market of devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD until May 26, 2024, under certain conditions. Moreover, the MDR provides that the following medical devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD may continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025. ‚Ä¢Devices placed on the market in compliance with the MDD prior to May 26, 2021; and‚Ä¢Devices placed on the market after May 26, 2021, benefiting from the described MDR transitional provisions. The European Commission further extended provision of the MDR and IVDR through Regulation (EU) 2023/607, whereby manufacturers and notified bodies are given sufficiently more time to carry out, in accordance with the MDR, the conformity assessment of devices covered by a certificate or a declaration of conformity issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC. Moreover, the deletion of the ‚Äòsell off‚Äô date in the MDR and the IVDR aims to prevent unnecessary disposal of safe devices. These provisions extend the transition period of devices through to December 31, 2027 or December 31, 2028 depending on device risk classification.The MDR, among other things:‚Ä¢strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;‚Ä¢establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers‚Äô responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;‚Ä¢improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;‚Ä¢sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and‚Ä¢strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.We have received certification at several locations, including Sydney, Australia; San Diego, California; and Lyon, France. We continue to transition our certification profile to meet the new MDR requirements.Other Regulatory BodiesOur devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada in Canada and CFDA in China. Other Healthcare LawsWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.-17-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Due to the breadth of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Congress set forth certain exceptions and authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations that set forth certain safe harbors to protect arrangements that while implicating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, would generally not cause harm to federal healthcare programs or patients. Satisfaction of all elements of a particular Anti-Kickback Statute statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor will provide immunity from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute to the parties to such remunerative arrangement. Failure to satisfy all elements of an exception or safe harbor, however, does not necessarily lead to a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute, each arrangement is subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether the requisite intent under the statute is present.The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes ‚Äúany request or demand‚Äù for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Private suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines, judgement, or settlement.The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary‚Äôs selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. As a medical device manufacturer, the beneficiary inducement prohibition under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law did not directly apply to us (unless we engaged in activities that influenced a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to select a particular provider, practitioner or supplier); however, following our acquisition of VirtuOx, a Medicare supplier, we will be directly subject to the beneficiary inducement prohibition if we provide any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that is intended to or that we should know would be likely to influence that beneficiary to select VirtuOx as their supplier.The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, or the Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395n, is a strict liability statute that prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, or DHS, payable by Medicare (and in some cases, Medicaid), unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to Medicare for DHS provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and requires the timely refund of collections related to any such prohibited claims. While VirtuOx is a Medicare-enrolled supplier, it currently bills only for the following CPT Codes: 94762, 95819, 95800, G0399, 93229, 93228, 93268, 93271, 93286, 93224, 93243, 93241, 93247, and 93245. None of these codes appear on the CMS DHS Code List, and therefore, we are not currently subject to the Stark Law by virtue of our acquisition of VirtuOx. However, we will need to monitor our VirtuOx offerings in the future and if we choose to offer any DHS, we will be subject to the Stark Law. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the FDA, and for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, to report annually to CMS information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals, physicians (as defined by statute) and, as of 2022, physician -18-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESassistants, nurse practitioners and other practitioners, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by such providers and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.Also, many U.S. states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs. In addition, in the U.S., certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries, either directly or through our contracted distributors. On February 10, 2025, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order ‚ÄúPausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security‚Äù, which paused federal investigations and enforcement actions brought under the FCPA for a period of 180 days. Subsequently, the Department of Justice issued new FCPA enforcement guidelines ending the temporary pause, emphasizing that enforcement will align with U.S. economic interests and national security. Most of the conduct chargeable under the FCPA will also constitute crimes under other laws, such as the U.S. wire fraud statute and the SEC‚Äôs civil enforcement authority. Foreign laws prohibiting bribery of a government official will also continue to apply.Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.Data Privacy and Security LawsUnder HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities and their business associates, as well as covered subcontractors. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation. In some of our operations, such as those involving our cloud-based software digital health applications, we are a business associate under HIPAA, requiring us to comply with the terms of the business associate agreements we have with our covered entity customers. Additionally, by virtue of our acquisition of VirtuOx, and expanded efforts to reach patients seeking treatment, we are also subject to the rules applicable to a covered entity. Therefore, we are required to comply with -19-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESthe HIPAA Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We are limited by HIPAA with respect to our use and disclosure of protected health information created or received and could potentially face significant civil and criminal penalties if the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR), or any state Attorney General, were to determine that we failed to comply with the applicable HIPAA standards.In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of personal information that are applicable to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or collectively, the CCPA, was the first of a series of state privacy laws designed to provide California residents expanded rights with regard to their personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for ‚Äúprotected health information‚Äù maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. CCPA‚Äôs implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, since 2020, more than one-third of U.S. states have adopted‚Äîand other states are proposing to adopt‚Äî their own comprehensive data protection laws, with varying implementation dates. The application of the laws and the requirements contained therein is not uniform. Although the majority of these omnibus state laws exclude business data, we may be required to undertake additional compliance investment to evaluate the application of these laws to our business and to implement compliance measures and potentially change our business processes. If we are subject to or affected by HIPAA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition to these comprehensive data protection laws, to date, several states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of biometrics, and additional states are seeking to regulate‚Äîand/or restrict the use of‚Äîbiometrics in the future. Certain of our products use, or permit the use of, information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws. If we are subject to or affected by these or other laws, we may be required to modify the way in which we make available our product or certain features of our products. We also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations. In addition, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The United Kingdom, or the UK, has adopted the UK General Data Protection Regulation, or UK GDPR; the EU GDPR and UK GDPR are herein collectively referred to as GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data, whenever GDPR applies to such processing, such as certain processing in the EEA, or in the UK. The GDPR increases our obligations, for example, by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals, strengthening individual data rights, instituting procedures for mandatory data breach notifications to regulators within a short timeframe, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information (including for research purposes), increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or UK, including to the U.S.; legal developments continue to create complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the EEA or UK to the U.S. For example, the European Commission and UK standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the European Union and the UK require us to evaluate such data transfers on a case-by-case basis to ensure continued permissibility under current law and consistent with the standard contractual clauses. GDPR provides that EEA member states and the UK may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to ‚Ç¨20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation. Further, the UK GDPR also provides for significant data protection fines up to the greater of ¬£17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.In addition, EEA member states and the UK may modify or impose additional conditions to be able to transmit electronic marketing communications.-20-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNumerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information and other personal information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states‚Äô Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. Both the FTC and the OCR have focused on the use of online tracking technologies that collect personal information and protected health information as an enforced priority. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information, including with respect to online tracking.Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to implement additional mechanisms to comply with the new data protection rules. With respect to VirtuOx, for instance, we will need to meet HIPAA's requirements for covered entities and support this additional privacy function. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, damage our reputation and customers‚Äô trust.Artificial Intelligence, or AI, LawsOur services and products may use AI now or in the future. The regulatory landscape for AI is changing rapidly, with both domestic and international activity.There is currently no comprehensive federal legislation in the U.S. concerning the use, development, or deployment of AI. Despite the lack of comprehensive legislation, federal regulators are continuing to pursue AI-related enforcement actions under existing federal laws. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued several enforcement actions against companies that are alleged to have made false or misleading statements about their AI capabilities, referred to as AI washing, in violation of the Securities Exchange Act. In addition to existing federal laws, federal regulators have also issued guidance concerning the use, development, or deployment of AI. For example, the FDA has issued a variety of guidance on the regulation of AI tools, including guidance on Software as a Medical Device, or SaMD, and clinical decision support, or CDS, software.There are also a number of state laws governing the use, development, or deployment of AI that may be applicable to our business. For example, the Colorado AI Act, or the Act, with compliance obligations taking effect on February 1, 2026, regulates the development, substantial modification, or deployment of AI in Colorado. The Act regulates the use of high-risk AI systems, defined as systems that make or are a substantial factor in making a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on the provision or denial to any consumer of, or the cost or terms of: education enrollment or opportunity, employment or an employment opportunity, a financial or lending service, an essential government service, healthcare services, housing, insurance, or legal services. The Act requires periodic impact assessments for high-risk AI systems and mandates the disclosure of algorithmic discrimination events to the State Attorney General. A number of other states have enacted laws that are more limited in scope and may impose certain transparency or disclosure obligations.In addition, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 on harmonized rules on artificial intelligence, or the EU AI Act, went into effect in August 2024. The EU AI Act aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI. The EU AI Act prohibits the use of AI systems that present unacceptable risk to fundamental rights or public safety. Non-prohibited AI systems may be subject to stringent requirements depending on the level of risk presented, including mandatory risk assessments, transparency obligations, and human oversight. Failure to comply with the requirements of the EU AI Act and the applicable national laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to ‚Ç¨35.0 million or up to 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Numerous other countries have adopted or are considering similar frameworks to regulate the use, development, or deployment of AI.-21-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe intend to continue to monitor developments regarding the use of AI that could be relevant to our products and services, and comply with all applicable laws regarding the use, development, or deployment of AI. Compliance with these and any other applicable AI laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with new AI laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, damage our reputation and customers‚Äô trust.Human Capital At Resmed, our mission of transforming patient care in the residential setting through innovative solutions and technology-driven integrated care is largely achieved by our continuous efforts to ensure that we prioritize fostering an inclusive environment that helps our people and our patients achieve success.

Any decline in our customer renewals, upgrades or expansions could adversely affect our future operating results. ‚Ä¢If our software products fail to perform properly or if we fail to develop enhancements, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims and our sales could decline. ‚Ä¢If there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure, our existing software customers may experience service outages, and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platforms. ‚Ä¢Climate change and natural disasters, or other events beyond our control, could negatively impact our business operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws, Regulations and Healthcare Industry Shifts‚Ä¢Healthcare reform or other cost-cutting measures, including changes in coverage policy for our products and services, by government or commercial payors may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations. ‚Ä¢Government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products, which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products. ‚Ä¢We are subject to various risks relating to our compliance with fraud and abuse laws and transparency laws relating to our interactions with our customers, healthcare providers, and patients, which could subject us to government investigation, litigation, or other penalties to the extent our activities or relationships are found not to comply or could otherwise cause us to incur significant costs to defend our actions, and could result in substantial fines, penalties, harm our reputation in the market, divert our management‚Äôs attention, or result in changes in our business operations that could harm our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services. ‚Ä¢Our use and disclosure of personal information, including health information, is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, artificial intelligence, data, biometrics and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability, regulatory investigations, legal actions, or reputational harm. ‚Ä¢Our business activities are subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. ‚Ä¢Product sales, introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of FDA regulations or similar foreign regulations, which could cause our sales and profits to decline. ‚Ä¢We are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.‚Ä¢Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages, personnel reductions, or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.‚Ä¢Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.‚Ä¢Laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities.‚Ä¢Tax laws, regulations, and enforcement practices are evolving, are aggressively pursued in some jurisdictions, and may cause expense as well as management distraction, which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.‚Ä¢We are subject to ongoing tax audits by local tax authorities, some of which are aggressively pursuing taxes on discontinued local operations.‚Ä¢Sustainability and corporate governance issues are constantly evolving, leading to distraction and expense, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock‚Ä¢Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons.‚Ä¢Our ability to sustain or grow dividends or repurchase shares is subject to board discretion.‚Ä¢Delaware law and provisions in our charter could make it difficult for another company to acquire us.-26-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRisk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business and IndustryOur inability to compete with new and existing technology to treat OSA successfully may harm our business. The geographic markets for our products, which encompass Sleep and Breathing Health products and Residential Care Software offerings, are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology, and new therapies, including existing and new pharmaceuticals. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and sell innovative new products and to enhance existing products that treat OSA more effectively than competing treatments. For our Sleep and Breathing Health business, the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete. Current competitors, new entrants, academics, and others currently may be developing, or may develop, new devices, alternative treatments or cures, and targeted or indirect pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat that could provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. For example, certain pharmaceutical treatments, such as GLP-1s currently approved to treat diabetes and for weight loss, may enhance patient health, lower the occurrence of obesity, or potentially reduce the severity or existence of OSA. For Residential Care Software, the demand for business management software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, subject to changing technology, with low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs, increased use of AI and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to create, implement and integrate their current business management software into their operations and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to change from their current in-house solution or provider to one of our platforms or products.Additionally, some of our competitors, including those described above, have greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. The past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the geographic markets for our products. Industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources, if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours, or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours. The healthcare space is attractive to many companies, particularly new entrants interested in developing digital health models to compete with offerings of more established companies like us. Additionally, one of our competitors, Philips, continues to operate in the U.S. under a consent decree resulting from its product recall. We cannot predict the timing or nature of their substantial return or the impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The temporary ban against sales of Philips flow generators has provided an opportunity for smaller companies to compete for customers. Continuing competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing. If we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing, enhance existing products, and offer products that purchasers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors, including the use of pharmaceuticals, our sales and gross margins could decrease which would harm our business. Consolidation in the healthcare industry and healthcare payment reform could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Many HME providers, durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, and residential health providers are consolidating, which may result in greater concentration of purchasing power. Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators, and third-party payors to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power where we sell our products and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or volume reductions for medical devices and components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows may suffer.Global macroeconomic conditions, including the direct and indirect effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions, reciprocal tariffs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Global economic conditions, geopolitical instability, the impact of tariffs and trade wars on our suppliers, and other macroeconomic factors, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, such as recent shipping disruptions in the Red Sea, interest rate and foreign currency rate fluctuations, and volatility in the capital markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The growth of our business and demand for our products and services are affected by changes in the health of the overall global economy. Deterioration in the global economic environment may cause decreased demand for our products and services which could result in lower product sales, services -27-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESrevenue, lower prices for our products, or reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payors, while increasing the cost of operating our business. Macroeconomic conditions may impact our global supply chain, primarily through constraints on or increased cost of acquiring raw materials and electronic components. These constraints on raw materials and electronic components may also impact companies outside of our direct industry, which could result in a competitive supply environment causing higher costs, requiring us to commit to minimum purchase obligations as well as make upfront payments to our suppliers. These disruptions may impact our ability to produce and supply products in quantities necessary to satisfy customer demand, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Highly competitive and constrained supply chain conditions may increase our cost of sales, which may adversely impact our profitability. We sell our products in many countries, and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Recently, the U.S. government imposed significant tariffs, as well as increases to existing tariffs, impacting a wide variety of goods across multiple countries and indicated that additional tariffs may be imposed in the near future. In response to the tariffs announced by the U.S., other countries have imposed, are considering imposing, and may in the future impose new or increased tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. The extent to which these threats will be enacted and the duration for which enacted tariffs will be in place remain uncertain and could lead to economic decline, which could negatively impact demand for our products and adversely affect our results of operations. Tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or retaliatory trade measures or tariffs implemented by other countries could result in reduced economic activity, increased costs in operating our business, reduced demand and changes in purchasing behaviors for our customers, limits on trade with the U.S. or other potentially adverse economic outcomes. Additionally, specific legislative and regulatory proposals may be introduced to change international trade law, regulations or interpretations thereof (possibly with retroactive effect) of various jurisdictions or limit trade relief benefits that, if enacted, could materially increase the cost of our goods to export internationally, increase our effective tax rate, or have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. We cannot predict whether our own or industry initiatives to maintain, extend or create tariff relief for our products and manufacturing will be successful. We also cannot predict the effect, if any, of the imposition of new or increased tariffs by one country and retaliatory responses by other countries who are trade partners. It is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business beyond the resilience of our current supply chain and investment in manufacturing flexibility. Further, actions we take to adapt to new tariffs or trade restrictions may increase our costs or risks or may cause us to modify our operations, which could be time-consuming and expensive; impact pricing of our products, which could impact our sales, profitability, and our reputation; or cause us to forgo new business opportunities. While tariffs and other retaliatory trade measures imposed by other countries on U.S. goods and services have not yet had a significant impact on our business or results of operations, we cannot predict further developments, and such existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on results of our operations, financial position and cash flows.Global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Although the majority of our net sales and cash generation have been made in the U.S., as our business in countries outside of the U.S. continues to increase, our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign sales and operations will increase. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan, and Canadian Dollar, have had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our financial results, including our net sales, margins, gains and losses, as well as on the values of our assets and liabilities.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by the effects of pandemics, epidemics, or other public health crises. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, which have had and may have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business in the future. The extent to which public health crises impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. These developments include, but are not limited to, actions taken to contain outbreaks or address their impact, the timing, distribution, and efficacy of treatments, and the imposition of government lockdowns, quarantine and physical distancing requirements. We are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability. We manufacture substantially all of our products outside the U.S. and sell a significant portion of our products outside the U.S. Sales in combined Europe, Asia and other regions accounted for approximately 36% and 36% of our net revenues in the -28-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESyears ended June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, respectively. Our sales and operations outside of the U.S. are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the U.S., including: ‚Ä¢fluctuations in currency exchange rates;‚Ä¢economic conditions such as inflation or recession;‚Ä¢tariffs and other trade barriers; ‚Ä¢compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations; ‚Ä¢difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;‚Ä¢reduction in third-party payor reimbursement for our products; ‚Ä¢inability to obtain import licenses; ‚Ä¢the impact of public health epidemics/pandemics on the global economy;‚Ä¢the impact of global geopolitical tensions and/or conflicts;‚Ä¢changes in trade policies and in U.S. and foreign tax policies; ‚Ä¢possible changes in export or import restrictions; ‚Ä¢the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects; and‚Ä¢limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property.In December 2021, the U.S. adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or the UFLPA, which creates a rebuttable presumption that any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Administrative Region of China, or that are produced by certain entities, are prohibited from importation into the U.S. and are not entitled to entry. These import restrictions came into effect in June 2022. Additionally, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the implementation of sanctions by the U.S. and other governments against Russia and has caused significant volatility and disruptions globally. The conflict between Israel and Iran may lead to fluctuations in oil prices and global economic instability, resulting in higher supply and transportation costs. While we are not presently aware of any direct impacts these restrictions have had on our suppliers‚Äô supply chains, disruptions resulting from the conflict in Iran and Ukraine and the UFLPA may materially and negatively impact our suppliers‚Äô ability to obtain a sufficient supply of raw materials necessary to meet the quantity and/or timing of our product demands. Further, it is not possible to predict the short- and long-term implications of global conflict, which could include but are not limited to further sanctions, uncertainty about economic and political stability, increases in inflation rate and energy prices, cyber-attacks, supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency exchange rates and financial markets. Our combined sales of medical devices into Iran, Russia and Ukraine did not constitute a material portion of our total revenue in fiscal year 2025. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions, or new geopolitical tensions, could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers in the broader region. We are continuing to monitor conflicts and geopolitical risks globally as well as assess the potential impact on our business.Any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our sales or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors, or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a part of the regulatory process to obtain marketing clearance or approval for new products and new indications for existing products, or for other reasons, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. We, our competitors, or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially sold products. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or -29-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESinconsistent with previous findings or could identify safety signals associated with our products. Current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints, may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various countries we address, or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data. Clinical data, or purchasers or regulatory bodies‚Äô perception of the clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals, and our position in, and share of, the countries in which we sell our products. Moreover, if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our products, potentially adverse consequences could result, including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products, we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products, we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings, we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients, and our reputation may suffer. Any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage, which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims. We are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates. In addition, we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court outside of our policy limits. Our insurance policies have various exclusions, and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage, requiring us to pay the entire amount of any award. We cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could harm our business. We may also be affected by the product recalls and other risks associated with the products of our competitors if customers and patients are uncertain if issues affecting our competitors may also affect us. Our intellectual property may not protect our products, and/or our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of owned and licensed patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain U.S. and foreign patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have in the past and may in the future be required to license patents and other intellectual property rights owned by other parties. We have pending patent applications, and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications. We do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. Legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving, and there is no globally consistent law or policy regarding the breadth of valid claims. Additionally, there may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property held by entities much larger than us, that are relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products. We face the risks that: ‚Ä¢third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights; ‚Ä¢our non-disclosure agreements will be breached; ‚Ä¢we will not have adequate remedies for infringement; ‚Ä¢our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors; ‚Ä¢third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products; or‚Ä¢third parties may assert patents and other intellectual property rights against our suppliers, causing interruption in supply of components or other essential inputs. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our proprietary rights, or to defend third-party claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others. If the outcome of any litigation, proceeding or claim brought against us were adverse, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties, could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products. If we become involved in any intellectual property litigation, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including but not limited to treble damages, attorneys‚Äô fees and costs, for past infringement, or could be at risk for an injunction if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights. Even if infringement claims -30-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESagainst us are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management‚Äôs attention from other business matters. In addition, a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Additionally, the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country, and we cannot provide assurance that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.If we fail to source, develop and retain key employees, our business may suffer. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to source and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, technology, and research and development positions. Competition for top talent in the healthcare, technology and Residential Care Software industries can be intense. Our ability to source and retain such talent will depend on many factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, flexibility regarding virtual and hybrid work arrangements, work location, work environment, industry economic conditions, and corporate culture. If we cannot effectively source, develop and retain qualified employees to drive our strategic goals, our business could suffer. Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business. As of June¬†30, 2025, our total consolidated debt was $0.7 billion and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:‚Ä¢making it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;‚Ä¢increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; ‚Ä¢limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;‚Ä¢limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and‚Ä¢exposing us to greater interest rate risk.Our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness, which could impede our growth. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.We are subject to new areas of direct healthcare oversight by federal government agencies due to our acquisition of VirtuOx. In May 2025, we acquired VirtuOx, a software-enabled IDTF and provider of technology solutions to facilitate in-home and remote testing services for sleep, respiratory, cardiac, and other health conditions across the U.S. As a Medicare-enrolled IDTF, VirtuOx is subject to laws, regulations and policy pertaining to its Medicare enrollment, state Medicaid participation, and direct billing of both governmental and commercial insurance programs. These laws include but are not limited to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal False Claims Acts, the Civil Monetary Penalty Law‚Äôs beneficiary inducement prohibition, and their state law equivalents. VirtuOx is also subject to HIPAA as a covered entity, which requires additional compliance efforts to meet all provisions under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and applicable requirements under the Electronic Standard Transactions Rule. As Resmed has historically only been subject to HIPAA as a business associate, these additional compliance requirements will require new policies, procedures, and data processing protocols, as well as the dedication of additional privacy, security and compliance personnel to ensure compliance with HIPAA. Further, VirtuOx‚Äôs direct billing status increases its risk relative to Resmed under the healthcare fraud and abuse laws and false claims laws. IDTFs, in particular, have extensive Medicare participation, billing and documentation requirements that will require additional compliance and legal resources to ensure that ongoing operations comply with applicable laws. If we become the subject of a government investigation, payor audit, or whistleblower lawsuit based on an allegation of noncompliance with one or more of these requirements, we risk potential refund of overpayments, financial penalties for violations, potential removal of participation in federal, state, and/or commercial payor programs, negative publicity, loss of public trust, and diversion of management‚Äôs time, attention and resources. Many of these risks exist even if we are able to successfully defend against such allegations. In the event that a violation is found, or we are forced to resolve a dispute with a governmental entity, our revenue, reputation, strategic goals, and business operations could suffer.-31-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRisks Related to Manufacturing, IT Systems, Commercial Operations and Plans for Future GrowthDisruptions in the supply of components from our suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. We purchase configured components for our devices from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. Disruptions in the price or supply of configured components may limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or cost-effective manner, which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. We cannot assure that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or, in the alternative, that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part. A reduction, delay or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components, or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part, may limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or cost-effective manner, which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. We cannot assure that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply.In particular, export controls and other trade restrictions on rare earth materials from China could limit the availability and increase the cost of key inputs in our supply chain. Recently, China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce introduced license requirements and volume caps covering these materials and certain finished magnet products, while reserving the right to suspend or reinstate them at any time. Such controls, combined with other geopolitical tensions, retaliatory tariffs or logistics disruptions may result in our suppliers being impacted by supply shortages or sharp price increases for the magnets on which many components depend. Because these magnets are integral to various assemblies used in our products, any sustained disruption could require us to absorb higher costs, qualify alternative sources or materials, redesign components, build strategic inventory, or adjust production schedules, each of which could delay deliveries, compress margins, and erode our competitive position. Prolonged or repeated interruptions could also lead to accelerated capital expenditures on supply-chain diversification, or necessitate contractual concessions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Additionally, substantial increases in product demand, including in response to a product recall by a major competitor, Philips, have resulted and could continue to result in higher costs for materials and components, and increased expenditures for freight and other expenses, which have and could continue to negatively impact our profit margins. If supply constraints continue, our ability to meet increased demand and our corresponding ability to sell affected products may be materially reduced. The reintroduction of products by Philips could lead to reduced demand for our products. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. Failed, substandard or delayed efforts to improve our IT System infrastructure may result in disruption to our business or materially increased costs. We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure, including technologies and services provided by third parties, to support our business processes and activities, products and customers. Our business therefore depends on effective, reliable and secure operation of our technology systems and related infrastructure. These technology systems are potentially vulnerable to obsolescence, breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access, migration or updates, and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. While we have invested heavily in upgrading our systems, as well as the protection of data and information technology and related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to upgrade, consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.Actual or attempted breaches of security, unauthorized disclosure of information, attacks which reduce availability of systems such as denial of service, or the perception that personal and/or other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer and information technology systems and those of our vendors and customers are vulnerable to attack and damage from computer viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, or other harm, including from threat actors seeking to cause disruption to our business. We face risks related to the protection of information that we maintain‚Äîor a third-party engaged to maintain information security on our behalf‚Äîincluding unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or modification of such information. Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect and respond to. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful -32-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESmalware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Such cyberattacks increasingly exploit AI and machine-learning techniques‚Äîranging from generative-AI phishing and deep-fake impersonations to automated vulnerability discovery, adaptive malware and large-scale credential-stuffing campaigns‚Äîeach of which can evolve rapidly to evade traditional security controls. A material cyberattack or security incident could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.We receive, collect, process, use and store a large amount of information from our customers, our patients and our own employees, including personal information, intellectual property, protected health and other sensitive and confidential information. This data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks, including the internet. The secure transmission of such information over the Internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems yet is vulnerable to unauthorized access and disclosure. We have implemented security measures, technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify, detect and prevent unauthorized access, alteration, use or disclosure of our customers‚Äô, patients‚Äô and employees‚Äô data. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. We may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities. Beyond external activity, systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address all possible threats or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations. If threat actors circumvent or breach our security systems, they could steal information or cause serious and potentially long-lasting disruption to our operations. Security breaches or attempts could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss and/or litigation, fines and sanctions. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our customers and others who interact with our data. While we maintain insurance that covers certain security incidents, we may not carry enough insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability. We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including HIPAA and GDPR, among others. Complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply could result in regulatory scrutiny, fines, civil liability or damage to our reputation. In addition, any security breach or attempt could result in liability for stolen assets or information, additional costs associated with repairing any system damage, incentives offered to customers or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach, and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches, including organizational changes, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, employee training and engagement of third-party experts and consultants. The costs incurred to remediate any security incident could be substantial. We cannot assure that our third-party service providers with access to our, or our customers, patients and/or employees‚Äô personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will not experience actual or attempted security breaches, which could have a negative effect on our business.We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results. Part of our growth strategy includes acquiring businesses consistent with our commitment to innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and related breathing health as well as our Residential Care Software business. The success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate the business and operations of the target companies. Additionally, our management may have attention diverted while trying to integrate acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of acquisitions, we may not realize the anticipated benefits fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. As noted above, our acquisition of VirtuOx involves the undertaking of additional risk areas and the investment of additional resources and personnel to manage that risk. It is possible that our return on investment is not realized given our investment of such additional -33-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESresources. There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Moreover, we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with our acquisitions. At least on an annual basis, we must evaluate whether facts and circumstances demonstrate any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets. The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill is dependent upon various considerations and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market characteristics, projections of acquired companies‚Äô future revenue, discount rates, and expectations of future cash flows. While we have made such assumptions in good faith and believe them to be reasonable, the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate, including for reasons beyond our control. Changes in such assumptions may cause a change in circumstances demonstrating that the carrying value of intangible assets may be impaired. Consequently, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of intangible assets is determined.If we are unable to support our continued growth or achieve expected operating efficiencies, our business could suffer. As we continue to grow, the complexity of our operations increases, placing greater demands on our management. Our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems, and implement information technology, and quality and regulatory compliance systems, among others. Unexpected difficulties during upgrades, expansion, the failure to attract and retain qualified employees, the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems, the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to slow or stop. We continually assess opportunities for improved operational efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, product and technology acquisitions and our people, which we believe is important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, there have been, and may in the future be, restructuring activities, realignment of strategies and cost reduction initiatives. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, reduced employee productivity, business disruption, and inability to attract or retain key personnel, which could negatively affect our business. Moreover, our restructuring and optimization initiatives could incur additional costs which impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under our restructuring plans or other initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. If we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently, our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer.In addition, productivity initiatives may at times involve reorganization or relocation of manufacturing activities. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition.Our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products, sleep clinics, and physicians. We market our products and services primarily to HME providers, sleep clinics, and physicians that diagnose OSA and other sleep disorders, as well as to non-sleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders in the course of providing primary care to patients. We believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand or type of product a patient will use. The success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly prescribed, marketed and sold by these third parties. We have limited resources to market to physicians, sleep clinics, HME provider branch locations and to the non-sleep specialists, most of whom use, sell or recommend several brands of products, therapies and additional services. We are limited under applicable fraud and abuse laws in the ways in which we market and sell to customers, prescribers, and patients. In addition, HME providers have experienced price pressures as government and third-party reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products, and HME providers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us. We cannot assure that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or recommend our services, or that HME providers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written. -34-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe have expanded our marketing activities in some areas to target the population with a predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists. We cannot assure that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products and services. The success of our software offerings depends substantially on customers entering, renewing, upgrading and expanding their agreements for cloud services, term licenses, and maintenance and support agreements with us. Any decline in our customer renewals, upgrades or expansions could adversely affect our future operating results. We typically enter into term-based agreements for our licensed on-premises offerings, cloud services, and maintenance and support services, which customers have discretion to renew or terminate. To improve our operating results, it is important that new customers enter into renewable agreements, and our existing customers renew, upgrade and expand their term-based agreements when the initial contract term expires. Our customers have no obligation to renew, upgrade or expand their agreements with us after the terms have expired. Our customers‚Äô renewal, upgrade and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate for a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our offerings, our pricing, the effects of general economic conditions, competitive offerings or alterations or reductions in our customers‚Äô spending levels. If our customers do not renew, upgrade or expand their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline.If our software products fail to perform properly or if we fail to develop enhancements, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims and our sales could decline. Our Residential Care Software operations are dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruptions and, as we continue to grow, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our infrastructure to maintain the performance of our products and solutions. The applications underlying our Residential Care Software products are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability or other performance problems. We have from time to time found defects in our products and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in data unavailability, unauthorized access to, loss, corruption or other harm to our customers‚Äô data. While we implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance, we may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before implementing our products and solutions. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our products and solutions have been deployed. If we fail to perform timely maintenance, or if customers are otherwise dissatisfied with the frequency and/or duration of our maintenance services and related system outages, our existing customers could elect not to renew their contracts, delay or withhold payment, or potential customers may not adopt our products and solutions and our brand and reputation could be harmed. In addition, the occurrence of any material defects, errors, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our software could result in warranty or other legal claims against us and diversion of our resources. The costs incurred in addressing and correcting any material defects or errors in our software and expanding our infrastructure and architecture in order to accommodate increased demand for our products and solutions may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. Further, if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies, we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products, or such products are not accepted or suffer significant delays in development, our financial results may suffer. An inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.If there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure, our existing software customers may experience service outages, and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platforms. We depend on services from various third parties as well as our own technical operations infrastructure to distribute our Residential Care Software products via the internet. If a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platforms or otherwise experiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers‚Äô access to our service, which could adversely affect their perception of our platform‚Äôs reliability and our revenues. Any disruptions in these services, including as a result of actions outside of our control, would significantly impact the continued performance of our Residential Care Software products. In the future, these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our Residential Care Software products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained and integrated into our infrastructure. To meet our business needs, we must maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to ensure that our Residential Care Software products are accessible. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions in our Residential Care Software products. Any interruptions or delays in our service, whether caused by our products, or as a result of third-party -35-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESerror, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause customers to terminate their agreements, impair our ability to obtain contract renewals from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, result in the expenditure of significant financial, technical and engineering resources, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements, and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Climate change and natural disasters, or other events beyond our control, could negatively impact our business operations and financial condition. Natural disasters and other business disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (such as frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (including due to regulatory changes), shifts in market trends (including customer preference for sustainably produced or reusable products) and other adverse effects. Such impacts may disrupt parties in our supply chain, our customers, and our operations. For example, if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, such as those in Sydney, Australia and Singapore which are vulnerable to such events, we may be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability may decline. Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. In the event our facilities are affected by natural or man-made disasters, we could be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers. Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business, it may not be sufficient to cover our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more legal and regulatory reporting requirements on the risks and costs of effects of climate change on the environment, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions and related reporting requirements, alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations, as well as adverse impacts on the availability of raw materials, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our operations and profitability.Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws, Regulations and Healthcare Industry ShiftsHealthcare reform or other cost-cutting measures, including changes in coverage policy for our products and services, by government or commercial payors may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law in the U.S. The ACA made changes, effective over time, that significantly impacted the healthcare industry, including medical device manufacturers. One of the principal purposes of the ACA was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who were uninsured. The ACA required adults not covered by an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate. The ACA also contained provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions. This included new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, entities that manufacture, produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for such devices sold in the U.S. This excise tax was applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs, which includes ApneaLink, VPAP Tx and certain breathing health products. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended beginning in 2016, and permanently repealed effective January 1, 2020. In addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above, the ACA also included, among other things, the implementation of new payment methodologies for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers, such as physicians and hospitals, and the establishment of a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify, prioritize and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. The increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research, which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products, may result in changes to Federal healthcare program coverage and reimbursement methodologies for our products and services which could also lead to lower reimbursements for our products and services by payors and decreased revenues to us. -36-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOther federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 required, among other things, mandatory across-the-board reductions in certain types of federal spending, also known as sequestration. Medicare claims with dates-of-service or dates-of-discharge on or after July 1, 2022 and effective until further notice, incur a 2% reduction in Medicare payment, known as Medicare Sequestration Payment Reductions. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 (CAA) was signed into law in March 2024. Among other things, the CAA reduced by half the 3.37% reduction to 2023‚Äôs Medicare Physician Fee Schedule conversion factor that had been in place since January 1, 2024, increasing the conversion factor to $33.32 for services furnished between March 9 and December 31, 2024. On November 1, 2024, CMS issued a rule finalizing changes for Medicare payments under the PFS and other Medicare Part B policies, effective on or after January 1, 2025. Under this final rule, the average payment rates under the PFS would be reduced by 2.93% in CY 2025, removing the temporary increase in payment for CY 2024. This amounts to an estimated CY 2025 PFS conversion factor of $32.35, resulting in lower Medicare payments to Part B suppliers. Notably, however, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, includes a 1-year, 2.5% increase to the PFS for 2026, which temporarily addresses the 2025 payment cuts. Additionally, the Medicare telehealth flexibilities under the COVID-19 public health emergency are set to expire at the end of 2025. Without Congressional action, Medicare will no longer cover most telehealth services furnished to beneficiaries in their home or to individuals residing in urban areas after the end of the year which could have an adverse impact on rates of diagnosis of OSA.In 2022, the VA proposed an adjustment through regulation to amend the previously adopted schedule of VA ratings for sleep apnea. Specifically, the proposed rule would remove in its entirety the current 30% disability rating for veterans exhibiting excessive daytime sleepiness and replace it with a 10% disability rating for veterans with a sleep apnea diagnosis with incomplete relief (as determined by a sleep study) with treatment including a CPAP machine, and further, remove the automatic 50% disability rating for veterans with a documented need for a CPAP machine (50% disability would instead require that the veteran have a sleep apnea diagnosis with ineffective treatment, as determined by a sleep study, or who is unable to use treatment due to comorbid conditions, without end-organ damage). The VA has not yet changed its ratings criteria, but it could happen this year. If the changes are implemented, veterans who were rated for sleep apnea before the change in criteria will be grandfathered and retain their rating. However, all veterans filing new claims on and after the change in ratings criteria would be evaluated under the new criteria. The VA has not yet adopted these changes to the disability ratings system for sleep apnea but should this proposal, or another similar proposal to limit disability ratings be adopted, fewer veterans may pursue treatment of sleep apnea using CPAP or more veterans would claim ineffective treatment with CPAP to obtain the higher rating.On June 9, 2025, CMS released long-awaited Medicare guidance on coverage and reimbursement for respiratory assist devices with bi-level capacity and mechanical ventilators when used in the home for the treatment of chronic respiratory failure consequent to COPD; a new CMS national coverage determination is expected in September 2025. Although national reimbursement criteria may ease existing reimbursement uncertainty over these items for this indication, it is unclear how national coverage criteria and associated documentation requirements will impact providers and suppliers who invoice Medicare directly; third-party payors may also follow suit in implementing similar policies.On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the budget reconciliation bill (entitled ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act‚Äù, referred to herein as the ‚ÄúBill‚Äù) to meet spending targets aimed at funding the Trump Administration‚Äôs domestic priorities that includes significant changes to the Medicaid program. A July 21, 2025 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that the bill will reduce the federal deficit by $366 billion over the next 10 years, due to decreased direct spending. Earlier June 2025 CBO preliminary estimates also showed that the Medicaid provisions of the bill would reduce Medicaid spending by approximately $1 trillion and would increase the number of people without health insurance by at least 11.8 million by 2034. Some key proposed changes to the Medicaid Program include, but are not limited to: work requirements; cost sharing of up to $35 per service on expansion adults who exceed the official poverty threshold; stricter eligibility requirements for non-U.S. citizens; requirements for states to conduct eligibility redeterminations at least every 6 months for Medicaid expansion adults; and prohibitions on states from establishing any new provider taxes or from increasing the rates of existing taxes, among other changes. Decreased federal funding and stricter eligibility requirements may result in more restrictive Medicaid programs at the state level and less individuals eligible for coverage, which could have an adverse impact on the number of individuals who seek to use our products and services. -37-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESDespite the ACA going into effect over a decade ago, there have been numerous legal and Congressional challenges to the law‚Äôs provisions and the effects of certain provisions has made compliance costly. For instance, changes to the ACA included in the Bill, such as shortening enrollment periods and eliminating automatic re-enrollment, could reduce overall ACA enrollment. We expect material changes in health policy, enforcement initiatives, and coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services from the Trump Administration and Congress. As such, our costs to monitor these changes and respond to new requirements are expected to increase. The full impact on our business of the ACA, the Medicare Sequestration Payment Reductions, VA disability ratings criteria, Medicaid funding, and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products and services. Future actions by the Administration and the U.S. Congress could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. It is unclear exactly how the new presidential administration will impact healthcare reform measures or what new cost-saving measures could be implemented, including what, if any, impact such changes will have on our business. We cannot predict what additional new legislation, agency priorities, and rulemaking may be on the horizon as the U.S. continues to reassess how it pays for healthcare. As a result, we cannot quantify or predict what impact any changes might have on our business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the U.S. The ACA as well as other federal and/or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, singularly or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products, which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products. Our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the reimbursement models and prices charged for medical products and services and can, without notice, deny or reduce coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products. Therefore, even if a product is approved for marketing, we cannot assure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product, that reimbursement will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount, even if initially adequate, will not be subsequently reduced. For example, in some countries, such as Spain, France and Germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other countries, such as Australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep apnea conditions. As we continue to develop new products, those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing, if at all. In the U.S., we sell our products primarily to HME providers, health systems and sleep clinics. Reductions in reimbursement to our customers by third-party payors, if they occur, may have a material impact on our customers and, therefore, may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to, or the collectability of receivables we have from, those customers. A development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the Medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Under the program, our customers who provide services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas, or CBAs. The competitive bidding program is currently on temporary pause; however, CMS could restart the program as part of further cost-cutting measures. We cannot predict the status or impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition. If changes are made to this program in the future, it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers and subsequent purchases from us.In addition, our products are the subject of periodic studies by third party agencies, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) in the U.S., intended to review the comparative effectiveness of different treatments of the same illness. In October 2022, the AHRQ concluded that randomized controlled clinical trials do not provide sufficient evidence that CPAP affects long-term clinically important outcomes. We believe that the AHRQ methodology was too restrictive, that retrospective and prospective observational studies should have been included, that real-world evidence should have been considered, and that CPAP therapy does have long-term positive effects on health outcomes. Although the results of comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate any reimbursement policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what, if any, effect such research will have on the sales of our products. To date, the AHRQ assessment has not impacted CMS or private payor -38-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESreimbursement. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products as a result of a third-party study could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to various risks relating to our compliance with fraud and abuse laws and transparency laws relating to our interactions with our customers, healthcare providers, and patients, which could subject us to government investigation, litigation, or other penalties to the extent our activities or relationships are found not to comply or could otherwise cause us to incur significant costs to defend our actions, and could result in substantial fines, penalties, harm our reputation in the market, divert our management‚Äôs attention, or result in changes in our business operations that could harm our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country.In the U.S., the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:‚Ä¢the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute itself to have committed a violation. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, plus potential exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in significant criminal penalties and imprisonment;‚Ä¢federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third-party payors. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations can result in debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. ‚Ä¢The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary‚Äôs selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. As a medical device manufacturer, the beneficiary inducement prohibition under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law did not directly apply to us (unless we engaged in activities that influenced a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to select a particular provider, practitioner or supplier); however, following our acquisition of VirtuOx, a Medicare supplier, we are directly subject to the beneficiary inducement prohibition if we provide any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that is intended to or that we should know would be likely to influence that beneficiary to select VirtuOx as their supplier.‚Ä¢HIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation; ‚Ä¢the federal Physician Sunshine Act requirements under the ACA, which impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any ‚Äútransfer of value‚Äù made or distributed by certain -39-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESmanufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to physicians (including doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), teaching hospitals, non-physician practitioners such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;‚Ä¢federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers; and‚Ä¢state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry‚Äôs voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.The scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management‚Äôs attention. Additionally, as a result of these types of investigations, healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation, increase costs, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, additional compliance and reporting obligations, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. In December 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys‚Äô Offices for the District Court of South Carolina, the Southern District of California, the Northern District of Iowa and the Eastern District of New York. The agreement resolved five lawsuits originally brought by whistleblowers under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and allegations that we: (a) provided DME companies with free telephone call center services and other free patient outreach services that enabled these companies to order resupplies for their patients with sleep apnea, (b) provided sleep labs with free and below-cost positive airway pressure masks and diagnostic machines, as well as free installation of these machines, (c) arranged for, and fully guaranteed the payments due on, interest-free loans that DME supplies acquired from third-party financial institutions for the purchase of our equipment, and (d) provided non-sleep specialist physicians free home sleep testing devices referred to as ‚ÄúApneaLink.‚Äù We agreed with the government to civilly resolve these matters for a payment of $39.5 million ($37.5 million to the federal government and $2 million to the various states) and we incurred additional fees and administrative costs that typically accompany such a resolution amounting to $1.1 million. The specific allegations and the resolution of those allegations are contained in the Company‚Äôs settlement agreement with the adverse parties. The total final costs relating to these matters were $40.6 million.Contemporaneous with the civil settlement, we also entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG. The CIA required, among other things, that we implement additional controls around our product pricing and sales and that we conduct internal and external monitoring of our arrangements with referrals sources. Our failure to comply with our obligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and our exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs. The costs associated with compliance with the CIA, or any liability or consequences associated with its breach, could have an adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Most of the obligations of the CIA expired on December 18, 2024. Absent an inquiry for additional materials from the OIG, we expect to close out the CIA shortly after the end of fiscal year 2025.-40-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOn May 11, 2022, VirtuOx entered into a civil settlement of $3.2M and agreed to a five-year CIA with the OIG which resolved allegations that, from January 2016 to December 2020, the company violated the False Claims Act by falsely identifying the place of service for certain services it performed to obtain a higher rate of reimbursement from Medicare and further, that the company administered overnight pulse oximetry tests and, at times, also billed Medicare for single determination pulse oximetry tests (commonly referred to as an oxygen ‚Äúspot check‚Äù) for the same patient when the only test performed was the overnight test. Under the CIA, VirtuOx must retain an outside expert to perform annual claims reviews that address the place of service identified on the claim. VirtuOx will be under the CIA through 2027 and any failure to comply with its obligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs. The costs associated with compliance with the CIA, or any liability or consequences associated with its breach, could have an adverse effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.Our use and disclosure of personal information, including health information, is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, artificial intelligence, data, biometrics and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability, regulatory investigations, legal actions, or reputational harm. The appropriate privacy and security of personal information whether stored, maintained, received or transmitted electronically or in paper form is a key regulatory issue in the U.S. and abroad. Although we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our posted privacy policies, legal standards for privacy, including but not limited to ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù and ‚Äúdeception,‚Äù as enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general, continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose audience and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Recently, there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacy-related lawsuits filed against companies. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, security or deletion of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.Numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including (i) state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches); (ii) HIPAA; and (iii) European and other foreign data protection laws, including the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR.HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically, collectively referred to as ‚Äúcovered entities,‚Äù and their ‚Äúbusiness associates,‚Äù which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health information, as well as their covered subcontractors. VirtuOx is a covered entity under HIPAA and is required to comply in all respects with the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule, and Electronic Standard Transactions Rule. Additionally, certain portions of our business, such as the cloud-based software digital health applications, subject us to HIPAA as a business associate of our covered entity clients. To provide our covered entity clients with services that involve access to PHI, HIPAA requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard PHI in accordance with HIPAA. As a business associate, we are also directly liable for compliance with HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.HIPAA authorizes state attorneys‚Äô general to file suit under HIPAA on behalf of state residents. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys‚Äô fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.HIPAA requires covered entities to provide notice to affected individuals, the HHS Office for Civil Rights, and in some cases, the media, in the event of a breach. HIPAA further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients in the event of a breach. Covered entities must notify affected individuals ‚Äúwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach‚Äù if their unsecured PHI is subject to an unauthorized access, use or disclosure. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, covered entities must report it to HHS and local media without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. If a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, the covered entity must log it and notify HHS at least annually. Breach notification obligations under -41-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESbusiness associate agreements often have shorter notification timeframes which we are required to abide by contractually. We could also face contractual liability if we fail to meet our obligations under our business associate agreements.If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, our solutions may be perceived as not secure, we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions. In addition, if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients, we may be liable not only contractually but also directly under HIPAA.In addition, the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA includes civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for ‚Äúprotected health information‚Äù maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Nearly one-third of US states have adopted similar omnibus privacy laws. Although most of these laws do not apply to business data, and, therefore, are not directly applicable to Resmed, we also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. If we are subject to other domestic privacy and data protection laws, beyond HIPAA and the CCPA, any liability from failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.In addition to these comprehensive data protection laws, to date, several states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of biometrics, and additional states may seek to regulate‚Äîand/or restrict the use of‚Äîbiometrics in the future. Certain of our products use, or permit the use of, information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws. If we are subject to or affected by these or other laws, including potential damages for improper use of biometrics, we may be subject to damages claims, required to modify the way in which we make available our products or certain features of our products. More recently, the FTC and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR, the agency that enforces HIPAA) have taken interest in the use of online tracking technologies that collect, use, and disclose personal information about users, including use of online tracking tools to gather information to be used for redirected marketing. FTC has taken enforcement actions against companies that have used online tracking tools either in a misleading or deceptive manner. In response to this new area of enforcement, we have been assessing our websites and applications to assess any online tracking and to ensure compliance with privacy and security standards. We also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations. If we are unable to comply with these laws, or if these laws require us to change our products or services, we may encounter liability that could adversely affect our financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, EU member states, the UK, and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time. In addition, the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, together, GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data whenever GDPR applies to such processing, such as certain processing in the EEA, or in the UK. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, and increased our obligations, for example, by imposing higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, requiring more robust disclosures to individuals, strengthening individual data rights, shortening timelines for data breach notifications, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information (including for research purposes), increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or UK and legal developments continue to create complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the EEA and UK to the U.S. For example, the European Commission and UK standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the European Union and the UK require us to evaluate such data transfers on a case-by-case basis to ensure -42-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIEScontinued permissibility under current law and consistent with the standard contractual clauses. GDPR provides that EEA member states and the UK may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to ‚Ç¨20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation. EU Member States and the UK also have established laws pertaining to electronic employee monitoring and data processing, which could require us to take additional compliance measures. Failure to comply with such laws may subject us to penalties. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the EU GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of ¬£17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with data protection rules. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may also result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security incident, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business activities are subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, local and international regulations regarding our business activities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, recalls of our products, substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees. Furthermore, certain of our products could be subject to recall if the FDA, other regulators or we determine that those products are not safe or effective. Any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs, damage our reputation, affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results. Certain of our products and services include the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is intended to enhance the operation of our products and services. AI innovation presents risks and challenges that could impact our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Ineffective AI development and deployment practices could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, increased cyber risks and legal liability, including under new AI regulations in the European Union. The FTC has issued a report expressing a concern regarding AI and bias across industry sectors, including in the healthcare space, and has suggested that such bias could lead to unfair and deceptive practices, among other concerns. Any changes to our ability to use AI or concerns about bias could require us to modify our products and services or could have other negative financial impact on our business.Product sales, introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of FDA regulations or similar foreign regulations, which could cause our sales and profits to decline. Unless a product is exempt or may be commercialized based on current FDA enforcement discretion policies, before we can market or sell a new medical device in the U.S., we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process that may be affected by external factors including FDA resourcing. We generally receive clearance from the FDA to market our products in the U.S. under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, or our products are exempt from the Section 510(k) clearance process. The 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is ‚Äúsubstantially equivalent‚Äù to a predicate device with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. The FDA has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may seek additional information before clearing a proposed device or may ultimately determine that a proposed device submitted for 510(k) clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) premarket notification clearance from the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, packaging, and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. We have modified some of our Section 510(k) approved products without submitting new Section 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. However, if the FDA -43-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESdisagrees with us and requires us to submit new Section 510(k) notifications for modifications to our existing products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the Section 510(k) notification. Any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous FDA examination process. For example, in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a modified or new product before submitting a 510(k) notice. We may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products. Indeed, recent trends in the FDA‚Äôs review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the FDA is often requiring manufacturers to provide new, more expansive, or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510(k) submission. This has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In September 2019, the FDA also issued revised final guidance establishing a ‚ÄúSafety and Performance Based Pathway‚Äù for ‚Äúmanufacturers of certain well-understood device types‚Äù allowing manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the ‚Äúsafety and performance based‚Äù pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria and recommended testing methodologies for each such device type, where feasible. Some of these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.The FDA‚Äôs ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing stricter requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. FDA continues to review its 510(k) clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances. The requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process and/or significant changes to the 510(k) clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with FDA compliance. Marketing and sale of our products outside the U.S. are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals, and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals, our sales could suffer. We cannot assure that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies.The definition of ‚Äúdevice‚Äù in the FD&C Act was amended in 2016 to exclude certain software functions. Our software offerings may include functions that fall under FDA‚Äôs jurisdictional definition of a medical device, while there may be software offerings that are considered exempt from the ‚Äúdevice‚Äù definition even when utilizing data coming from an FDA regulated medical device. Our determination of the appropriate classification of our digital offerings may lead to regulatory inquiry and the expenditure of time and resources to meet FDA feedback as to the appropriate category for particular digital offerings. We are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The FDA regulates the approval, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of many of our products in the U.S. Significant government regulation also exists in Canada, Japan, Europe, Australia, China, and other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA‚Äôs QSR requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. For example, on January 31, 2024, the FDA issued a final rule to amend and replace the QSR, which sets forth the FDA's current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices, to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization standards. Specifically, this final rule, which the FDA expects to go into effect on February 2, 2026, establishes the QMSR, which among other things, incorporates by reference the quality management -44-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESsystem requirements of ISO 13485:2016. Although the FDA has stated that the standards contained in ISO 13485:2016 are substantially similar to those set forth in the QSR, and although our quality system is currently designed to comply with ISO standards in connection with our device certifications, it is unclear the extent to which this final rule, once effective, could impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us that could increase the costs of compliance or otherwise negatively affect our business. If we are unable to comply with QMSR, once effective, or with any other new or existing laws or regulations enforced by FDA or comparable regulatory authorities, we may be subject to enforcement action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications and comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages, personnel reductions, or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. The ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, staffing reductions, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA‚Äôs ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA‚Äôs ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Agency restructuring, changes in appropriations, reductions in force and other disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may slow the time necessary for medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved medical devices to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about FDA-cleared products. In particular, clearance under Section 510(k) only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.Laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities. Our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world. Certain laws, such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act, regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers, such as phone calls, texts or emails. Our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws, or by laws, regulations, or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future. Similarly, certain data privacy laws, including CCPA, and subsequently CPRA, and the GDPR require disclosure of our privacy practices to consumers. If we are found to have violated these laws or regulations, we may be subjected to substantial fines, penalties, or liabilities to consumers. -45-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESTax laws, regulations, and enforcement practices are evolving, are aggressively pursued in some jurisdictions, and may cause expense as well as management distraction, which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Tax laws, regulations, and enforcement practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in enforcement priorities due to economic, political, and other conditions. Developments in relevant tax laws, regulations, and administrative and enforcement practices, even if eventually unsubstantiated, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our financial position and cash flows and could impact the tax treatment of our past or future earnings. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of conducting a global business subject to varying tax laws for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes. Governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, particularly from multinational corporations, which may lead to an increase in audit activity and aggressive positions taken by tax authorities.Furthermore, due to shifting global economic and political conditions, tax policies and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, in calendar year 2022, the U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which made a several changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, including a 15% corporate minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for companies whose average adjusted net income for any consecutive three-year period beginning after December 31, 2022 exceeds $1.0 billion. While we do not anticipate any materially adverse impacts to our effective tax rate, we cannot provide any assurances that these provisions will not have a materially adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, beginning in 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for U.S. incurred expenditures or fifteen years for non-U.S. incurred expenditures, pursuant to IRC Section 174. On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law modifying IRC Section 174 to reinstate the deduction for research and development expenditures where such activities are performed within the U.S. The Bill also introduces new provisions allowing for the immediate deduction of certain capital expenditures, which may have an impact on our future tax payments. We are in the process of evaluating the future impact of the Bill to our consolidated financial statements.Additionally, while several countries, including the U.S. and other members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, have reached agreement on a global minimum tax initiative, or Pillar Two, on June 28, 2025, the G7 issued a joint statement in which its members agreed that Pillar Two will operate alongside the U.S. system of tax and proposed that U.S.-parented multinational groups would not be subject to the income inclusion rules and undertaxed profits rules of Pillar Two. The remaining OECD countries are likely to consider changes to existing and proposed tax laws to align with the recommendations and guidelines proposed by G7. However, enactment or inconsistent application of such tax laws could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. We have assessed the impact of the laws in effect as of June 30, 2025 and anticipate that the Pillar Two minimum tax may impact our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2026. We cannot provide any assurances that there will not be a material impact on our effective tax rate in future years because of evolving tax legislation.We are subject to ongoing tax audits by various local tax authorities, some of which are aggressively pursuing taxes on discontinued local operations. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that require significant judgement and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations and audits by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. If any ongoing tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management‚Äôs expectations, the result could be a material adjustment to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results. We are currently under audit by the Australian Taxation Office, or the ATO, for the 2018 tax year. Additionally, tax years 2018 to 2024 remain open to examination by the major jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our positions and methodologies related to transfer pricing, including valuing developed technology, intercompany arrangements and intellectual property transfers. If challenged by tax authorities, Resmed will vigorously defend our positions and methodologies. Although we believe our tax positions are appropriate, any final assessment arising from tax audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.-46-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSustainability and corporate governance issues are constantly evolving, leading to additional investment and expense, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. There is a focus from certain investors, regulators, legislators, customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning sustainability matters. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies‚Äô sustainability practices continue to grow. At the same time, certain countries have eliminated required reporting of sustainability practices. If our sustainability practices, including our external reporting thereof, fail to meet inconsistent regulatory requirements in jurisdictions in which we do business or stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, carbon emissions, renewable energy targets, support for local communities, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand, and employee attraction and retention may be negatively impacted. Customers and/or suppliers may also adopt policies that include sustainability provisions or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. These sustainability provisions and initiatives can be inconsistent, unpredictable and difficult for us to meet. If we are unable to comply, our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue business with us. In addition, failure to comply with new laws, regulations, or reporting requirements could negatively impact our reputation and our business. Our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional expense and investments that could impact our profitability.Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common StockOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons. Our operating results have, from time to time, fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future. These fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including: ‚Ä¢the introduction of new products by us or our competitors; ‚Ä¢the geographic mix of product sales; ‚Ä¢the success and costs of our marketing efforts in new regions; ‚Ä¢changes in third-party payor reimbursement; ‚Ä¢timing of regulatory clearances and approvals; ‚Ä¢costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses, technologies and product offerings;‚Ä¢timing of orders by distributors; ‚Ä¢inventory write downs, which may result from maintaining significant inventories of raw materials, components, and finished goods;‚Ä¢expenditures incurred for research and development; ‚Ä¢competitive pricing in different regions; ‚Ä¢the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses; ‚Ä¢other activities, including product recalls, by us and our competitors;‚Ä¢the perceived demand for our products in light of the introduction of pharmaceuticals to treat obesity and OSA; and ‚Ä¢general economic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, recessions, consumer sentiment and demand, global political conflict and industry factors unrelated to our actual performance.Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate.Our ability to sustain or grow dividends or repurchase shares is subject to board discretion. Our dividend declarations, share-repurchase programs and other capital allocations are subject entirely to the discretion of our board of directors. The board of directors reviews these matters periodically and may, at any time and for any reason, decide to decrease, suspend or discontinue dividends, reduce or pause share repurchases, or redirect available cash toward alternative uses‚Äîsuch as strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives or other corporate purposes.-47-Table of ContentsPART IItem 1ARESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESAmong the factors the board of directors considers are our operating results, cash-flow generation, future funding requirements, prevailing economic and market conditions, legal and regulatory constraints under applicable corporate law, and the overall balance between returning capital to shareholders and investing for long-term growth. As these factors can change rapidly and are influenced by events beyond our control, investors should not rely on past dividend payments or repurchase activity as an indication of future distributions. Any modification to our capital return practices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and diminish the total return to shareholders.Delaware law and provisions in our charter could make it difficult for another company to acquire us. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.ITEM 1C CYBERSECURITYRisk Management and StrategyWe seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. Our cybersecurity program is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Our management team has adopted policies, standards, processes, and practices and implemented controls and procedures that allow us to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats enabling our board of directors to actively oversee the strategic direction, objectives, and effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework. Our processes are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, as implemented by management and as overseen by our board of directors. Our board of directors has an important role in risk oversight. To identify and assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, we use a risk assessment process aligned with standard industry frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 27001 and other industry standards. We engage in regular network and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing, among other exercises. We continuously monitor threats and unauthorized access to our network through both internal and external third-party resources. We have developed incident response plans which include triage, assessing the severity of incidents, escalation protocols, containment of incidents, investigation of incidents, and remediation. We provide annual privacy and security training for all employees which incorporates awareness of cyber threats (including but not limited to malware, ransomware, and social engineering attacks), password hygiene and incident reporting processes. We have also implemented processes to identify, monitor and address material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of critical third-party service providers, including those in our supply chain or who have access to our systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data. Additionally, we require those third parties that could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to provide ISO certifications or Service Organization Controls, or SOC, 2 reports as evidence of a cybersecurity audit and these reports are reviewed and assessed for risk.

It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, or SDB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our digital cloud-based health software applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns. We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2025, we invested $331.3 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.4% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. For example, our newest device, AirSense 11, introduced new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy, digital enhancements and over-the-air update capabilities. Our operations include residential care software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our Residential Care Software business and, along with our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, these products should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry, or Sleep and Breathing Health, and the supply of business management software as a service to residential healthcare providers, or Residential Care Software. During fiscal year 2025, we renamed our operating segments from Sleep and Respiratory Care to Sleep and Breathing Health and from Software as a Service to Residential Care Software in alignment with our 2030 strategy. There have been no changes in the preparation and disclosure of financial information by operating segment.Net revenue in fiscal year 2025 increased to $5,146.3 million, an increase of 10% compared to fiscal year 2024. Gross profit increased for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 to $3,055.0 million, from $2,655.3 million for the year ended June¬†30, 2024, an increase of $399.7 million or 15%. Our net income for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 was $1,400.7 million or $9.51 per diluted share compared to net income of $1,021.0 million or $6.92 per diluted share for the year ended June¬†30, 2024. Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2025 was $1,751.6 million and at June¬†30, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,209.5 million. At June¬†30, 2025, our total assets were $8.2 billion and our stockholders‚Äô equity was $6.0 billion.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 increased by 8% compared to the year ended June¬†30, 2024. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.4% for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 compared to 6.6% for the year ended June¬†30, 2024. The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs.Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 was $45.3 million compared to $46.5 million for the year ended the year ended June¬†30, 2024. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles is due to certain acquired intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives and becoming fully amortized, partially offset by increases from amortization of acquired intangibles associated with new acquisitions.Restructuring Expenses We did not incur material restructuring expenses during the year ended June¬†30, 2025. During the year ended June¬†30, 2024, we incurred restructuring expenses of $64.2 million associated with an evaluation of our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. Restructuring charges for the year ended June¬†30, 2024 were comprised of $28.6 million of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities, and $2.4 million of other miscellaneous asset impairments.

Losses associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities were $10.3 million for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 compared to a loss of $4.0 million or the year ended June¬†30, 2024. Losses associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities were partially offset by a gain attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 of $3.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.8 million for the year ended June¬†30, 2024. -57-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIncome Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased to 16.5% for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 from 19.3% for the year ended June¬†30, 2024. Our effective rate of 16.5% for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to interest and penalties refunded by the IRS in relation to certain amended returns, tax benefits realized from the cessation of certain business activities, along with research credits and foreign operations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 was primarily due to the IRS refund of interest and penalties and tax benefits realized from the cessation of certain business activities. Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the TCJA, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 ‚Äì Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).The Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) has put forth two proposals‚ÄîPillar One and Pillar Two‚Äîthat (i) revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and (ii) ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. Effective in our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, various jurisdictions in which we operate began implementing the global minimum tax prescribed under Pillar Two. These changes in legislation did not have a material impact on our income tax expense and cash flows for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. On June 28, 2025, the G7 issued a joint statement in which its members agreed that Pillar Two will operate alongside the U.S. system of tax and proposed that U.S.-parented multinational groups would not be subject to the income inclusion rules and undertaxed profits rules of Pillar Two. The remaining OECD countries are likely to consider changes to existing and proposed tax laws to align with the recommendations and guidelines proposed by G7. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of the Inclusive Framework for future periods.Net Income and Earnings per ShareAs a result of the factors discussed above, our net income for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 was $1,400.7 million compared to net income of $1,021.0 million for the year ended June¬†30, 2024. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June¬†30, 2025 was $9.51 compared to $6.92 for the year ended June¬†30, 2024, an increase of 37%. Summary of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The measure ‚Äúnon-GAAP cost of sales‚Äù is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and field safety notification expenses. The masks with magnets field safety notification expenses relate to estimated costs to provide alternative masks to patients in response to updated contraindications for use of masks that incorporate magnets. The Astral field safety notification expenses relate to estimated costs associated with the replacement of a certain component in some of our Astral ventilation devices that were manufactured between 2013 to 2019. The measure ‚Äúnon-GAAP gross profit‚Äù is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and ‚Äúnon-GAAP gross margin‚Äù is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue. -58-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7RESMED INC.

Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, share repurchases, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels. As of June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,209.5 million and $238.4 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the U.S. at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024 were $555.0 million and $51.2 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, were $654.5 million and $187.2 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.As of June¬†30, 2025, we had up to $1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $2,709.5 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility. We repatriated $1,050.0 million and $800.0 million to the U.S. during the years ended June¬†30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the U.S. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2025 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign -60-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsinvestment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the U.S., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.As a result of the TCJA, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $92.4 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 ‚Äì Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior NotesOn June¬†29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or as amended from time to time, the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million or 1.0 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June¬†29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement, or the Term Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on Jun¬†29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of June¬†30, 2025, we had $1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.On July¬†10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July¬†10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July¬†10, 2029, or the Senior Notes. On June¬†30, 2025, there was a total of $670.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes.

See Note 13 ‚Äì Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and -62-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsliabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: (1)Valuation of Goodwill. We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value and fair value of our goodwill. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management‚Äôs estimate of the asset‚Äôs continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of the assets in our business objectives. If goodwill is considered to be impaired, we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value, limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset‚Äôs ability to generate positive cash flow, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries. We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps: Step 0 or Qualitative assessment ‚Äì Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.Step 1 ‚Äì Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit‚Äôs fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.During the annual reviews for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.(2)Income Tax. Management judgment is required in determining our income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the current period or subsequent periods.We maintain valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.-63-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 7RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes on a quarterly basis. Based on our assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision, deferred taxes and valuation allowances in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.Tax years 2018 to 2024 remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.(3)Revenue Recognition. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are Sleep and Breathing Health and Residential Care Software. For products in our Sleep and Breathing Health business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our Residential Care Software business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. Unbilled receivables arise when revenue is recognized for goods or services transferred but the customer has not yet been invoiced, typically due to billing terms or timing differences. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Breathing Health business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Residential Care Software business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some Residential Care Software contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Breathing Health segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns by our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. Returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.We offer our Sleep and Breathing Health customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer‚Äôs expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods. We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Breathing Health distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method. We also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Breathing Health as well as our Residential Care Software customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs.When Sleep and Breathing Health or Residential Care Software contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers.

AND SUBSIDIARIESQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market and Business RisksITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET AND BUSINESS RISKSForeign Currency Market RiskOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have significant foreign currency exposure through our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities and our international sales operations. Net Investment and Fair Value HedgingOn November 17, 2022, we executed foreign cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges and fair value hedges in designated hedging relationships with either the foreign denominated net asset balances or the foreign denominated intercompany loan as the hedged items. All derivatives are recorded at fair value as either an asset or liability. Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the hedged item.The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the fair value hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated intercompany debt between USD and EUR. For these hedges, we excluded certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are not related to spot rates. For fair value hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the same line item as the hedged item, Other, net, in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the statement of income under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in interest (expense) income, net. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the net investment hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on the net asset balances of our foreign functional subsidiaries. For net investment hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The initial fair value of components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness will be recognized in interest (expense) income, net. The notional value of outstanding foreign cross-currency swaps was $1,128.3 million and $1,026.2 million at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to December 31, 2029.Non-Designated HedgesWe transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed three years. The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was $1,410.2 million and $1,340.0 million at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, respectively.

At June¬†30, 2025, there was $170.0 million outstanding under the term loan facilities, which were subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the year ended June¬†30, 2025, would not have had a material impact on pretax income. We have no interest rate hedging agreements. On July¬†10, 2019, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July¬†10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July¬†10, 2029. The interest rate on these notes is fixed and not subject to fluctuation. InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products, freight, overhead costs or wage rates may adversely affect our operating results. Sustained inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to offset such higher costs through price increases.-68-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 7, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Evaluation of goodwill triggering eventsAs discussed in Notes 2(i) and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company‚Äôs goodwill balance was $3,047 million as of June 30, 2025. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, might exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. In the current year, the Company performed qualitative, or Step 0, assessments to determine whether there was a greater than 50 percent likelihood that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value. After completing Step 0, the Company determined that goodwill was not more likely than not impaired and, therefore, no Step 1, or quantitative assessment, was necessary. -70-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe identified the evaluation of goodwill triggering events as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of potential triggering events, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization and events specific to the entity and reporting units, required a higher degree of auditor judgment. These potential triggering events could have a significant effect on the Company‚Äôs Step 0 assessment and the determination of whether further quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was required. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the evaluation of goodwill impairment. This included a control related to the Company‚Äôs assessment of potential goodwill triggering events. We evaluated the Company‚Äôs Step 0 assessment for its reporting units by:‚Ä¢considering macroeconomic conditions including gross domestic product, labor market, and inflation by key regions around the world for negative indicators ‚Ä¢evaluating information from analyst reports in the enterprise software and sleep and breathing health industries, which were compared to industry and market considerations used by the Company ‚Ä¢analyzing information including changes in the costs of raw materials and labor, the financial performance of the reporting units, the Company‚Äôs market capitalization, and other entity and reporting-unit specific events. /s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 1994.San Diego, CaliforniaAugust 7, 2025-71-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(1) Organization and Basis of Presentation ResMed Inc. (referred to herein as "Resmed", ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is a Delaware corporation formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the Resmed Group. Through our subsidiaries, we design, manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, France, China and the United States, or U.S. Major distribution and sales sites are located in the U.S., Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, China, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We also operate a software as a service, or SaaS, business in the U.S. and Germany that includes residential care software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a)Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from management‚Äôs estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. (b)Revenue Recognition In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, ‚ÄúRevenue from Contracts with Customers‚Äù, we account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry, or Sleep and Breathing Health, and the supply of business management SaaS to residential care providers, or Residential Care Software. Our Sleep and Breathing Health revenue relates primarily to the sale of our products that are therapy-based equipment. Some contracts include additional performance obligations such as the provision of extended warranties and provision of data for patient monitoring. Our Residential Care Software revenue relates to the provision of software access with ongoing support and maintenance services as well as professional services such as training and consulting.Disaggregation of revenueSee Note 13 ‚Äì Segment Information for our net revenue disaggregated by segment, product and region for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023.Performance obligations and contract balancesRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of risk and/or control of our products at a point in time. For products in our Sleep and Breathing Health business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our Residential Care Software business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. Unbilled receivables arise when revenue is recognized for goods or services transferred but the customer has not yet been invoiced, typically due to billing terms or timing differences. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Breathing Health business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Residential Care Software business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some Residential Care Software contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one year to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components. -77-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe following table summarizes our contract balances as of June¬†30, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands):20252024Balance sheet captionContract assetsAccounts receivable, net$939,492¬†$837,275¬†Accounts receivable, netUnbilled receivables, current$51,175¬†$38,183¬†Prepaid expenses and other current assetsUnbilled receivables, non-current$14,581¬†$18,450¬†Prepaid taxes and other non-current assetsContract liabilitiesDeferred revenue, current$(166,030)$(152,554)Deferred revenue (current liabilities)Deferred revenue, non-current$(156,803)$(137,343)Deferred revenue (non-current liabilities)Transaction price determinationRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Breathing Health segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns by our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. Returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.We offer our Sleep and Breathing Health customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer‚Äôs expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods. We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Breathing Health distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method. We also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Breathing Health as well as our Residential Care Software customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs.When Sleep and Breathing Health or Residential Care Software contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Breathing Health contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.Accounting and practical expedient electionsWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities associated with our Sleep and Breathing Health segment as a fulfillment cost within cost of sales, and record shipping and handling costs collected from customers in net revenue. We have also elected for all taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, to be excluded from revenue and presented on a net basis. We have adopted two practical expedients including the ‚Äúright to invoice‚Äù practical expedient, which is relevant for some of our Residential Care Software contracts as it allows us to recognize revenue in the amount of the invoice when it corresponds directly with the value of performance completed to date. The second practical expedient adopted permits -78-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsrelief from considering a significant financing component when the payment for the good or service is expected to be one year or less.(c)Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant CustomersFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateralization and master-netting agreements. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for any of the periods presented.(d) Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure our financial instruments at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument‚Äôs classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair value because of their short-term nature. The carrying value of long-term debt related to our Revolving Credit and Term Credit Agreements approximates its fair value as the principal amounts outstanding are subject to variable interest rates that are based on market rates which are regularly reset. The carrying value of long-term debt related to our Senior Notes can differ to its fair value as the principal amounts outstanding are subject to fixed interest rates as outlined in Note 8 ‚Äì Debt. Foreign currency hedging instruments are marked to market and therefore reflect their fair value. In addition, we measure investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held equity securities for which there has been an observable price change in an identical or similar security, at fair value. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. (e)Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments and we state them at cost, which approximates market. We consider investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.Our cash and cash equivalents balance at June¬†30, 2025 includes $302.7 million in institutional money market accounts that require advance notice of up to 90 days for redemption, in accordance with the terms of the investment agreements. These cash balances earn interest rates above normal term deposit rates otherwise available and are held at highly rated financial institutions.(f)Inventories We state inventories at the lower of cost (determined principally by the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. We include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs in finished goods and work-in-process inventories. We review and provide for any product obsolescence in our manufacturing and distribution operations by assessing throughout the year individual products and components (based on estimated future usage and sales).-79-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(g)Property, Plant and Equipment We record property, plant and equipment, including rental and demonstration equipment at cost. We compute depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are generally two years to ten years except for buildings which are depreciated over an estimated useful life of forty years and leasehold improvements, which we amortize over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term. We charge maintenance and repairs to expense as we incur them.Depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment was $111.8 million, $88.9 million, and $84.7 million for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.(h)Intangible Assets We capitalize the registration costs for new patents and amortize the costs over the estimated useful life of the patent, which is generally ten years. If a patent is superseded or a product is retired, any unamortized costs are written off immediately.We amortize our other intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two years to fifteen years. We evaluate events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists and, at least annually, evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets. (i)Goodwill We conduct our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of the fiscal year. Our goodwill impairment review is performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments and involves the following steps: Step 0 or Qualitative assessment ‚Äì Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.Step 1 ‚Äì Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit‚Äôs fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.During the annual reviews for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.(j)Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation process involves the use of estimates and assumptions made in connection with determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset, the timing of such cash flows, the remaining useful life of assets and applicable discount rates. If actual results vary from the estimates or assumptions used in the valuation or allocation process, we may be required to record an impairment charge or an increase in depreciation or amortization in future periods, or both.-80-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC.

The following discusses our accounting for investments in marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, and investments accounted for under the equity method.Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Marketable equity securities are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and are recorded in prepaid taxes and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity securities are reported at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We assess non-marketable equity securities at least quarterly for impairment and consider qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee's financial metrics, product and commercial outlook and cash usage. All gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments as a component of other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of income.Equity investments whereby we have significant influence but not control over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee‚Äôs activities, are accounted for under the equity method. Under this method, we record our share of gains or losses attributable to equity method investments as a component of other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of income. (l)Research and Development We record all research and development expenses in the period we incur them.(m)Foreign Currency The consolidated financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar at period end exchange rates but translate revenue and expense transactions at average exchange rates for the period. We recognize cumulative translation adjustments as part of comprehensive income, as detailed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and include those adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets until such time the relevant subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated. We reflect gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an entity in our results of operations.(n)Foreign Exchange Risk Management We may use derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign cross-currency swaps, purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to mitigate exposure from certain foreign currency risk. No derivatives are used for trading or speculative purposes. We do not require or are not required to pledge collateral for the derivative instruments.Fair Value and Net Investment HedgingOn November 17, 2022, we executed foreign cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges and fair value hedges in designated hedging relationships with either the foreign denominated net asset balances or the foreign denominated intercompany loan as the hedged items. All derivatives are recorded at fair value as either an asset or liability. Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the hedged item.The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the fair value hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated intercompany debt between USD and EUR. For these hedges, we excluded certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are not related to spot rates. For fair value hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the same line item -81-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsas the hedged item, other, net, in the consolidated statement of income. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the statement of income under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in interest (expense) income, net. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the net investment hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on the net asset balances of our foreign functional subsidiaries. For net investment hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The initial fair value of components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness will be recognized in interest (expense) income, net. The notional value of outstanding foreign cross-currency swaps was $1,128.3 million and $1,026.2 million at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to December 31, 2029.Non-Designated HedgesWe transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed two years. The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our consolidated statements of income. The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was $1,410.2 million and $1,340.0 million at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to June¬†15, 2026.We classified the fair values of all hedging instruments as Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties to financial instruments. We minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major financial institutions and we do not expect material losses as a result of default by our counterparties.(o)Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the impact of a tax position in the consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense.(p)Allowance for Credit LossesWe maintain an allowance for credit losses on customer receivables based expected losses, considering our historical write-off experience, an assessment of our customers‚Äô financial conditions, and available information that is relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows, which includes current conditions and forecasts about future economic conditions. Customer receivables are charged against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. -82-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe are also contingently liable, within certain limits, in the event of a customer default, to independent financing companies in connection with customer financing programs. We monitor the collection status of these installment receivables and provide for estimated losses separately under accrued expenses within our consolidated balance sheets based upon our historical collection experience with such receivables and a current assessment of our credit exposure.(q)Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including certain identifiable intangible assets, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as the impairment the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the year ended June¬†30, 2024, we impaired $18.6¬†million of developed/core product technology intangible assets, $14.5¬†million of customer relationship intangible assets, and $0.1¬†million of other intangibles associated with restructuring activities. These non-cash charges were recorded within restructuring expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 17 ‚Äì Restructuring Expenses for the facts and circumstances leading to the impairments. We did not record any material intangible asset impairments during the years ended June¬†30, 2025 and 2023.(r)ContingenciesWe record a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.

The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million or 1.0 times the EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. The Revolving Credit Agreement amends and restates that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2018, among Resmed, MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Westpac Banking Corporation and the lenders party thereto.Additionally, on June¬†29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement and First Amendment to Unconditional Guaranty Agreement, or the Term Credit Agreement, as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, which amends that certain Syndicated Facility Agreement dated as of April 17, 2018. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, and ResMed Pty Limited‚Äôs obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement contain customary covenants, including, in each case, a financial covenant that requires that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, as applicable). The entire principal amounts of the revolving credit facility and term credit facility, and, in each case, any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable. Events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement include, in each case, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the respective agreements or related documents, or certain changes of control of us, or the respective guarantors of the obligations borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on June¬†29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. Amounts borrowed under the Term Credit Agreement will also amortize on a semi-annual basis, with a $5.0 million principal payment required on each such semi-annual amortization date. The outstanding principal amounts will bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus 0.75% to 1.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable) plus 0.0% to 0.50% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At June¬†30, 2025, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amounts was 5.15%. An applicable commitment fee of 0.075% to 0.150% (depending on the then-applicable leverage -87-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsratio) applies on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. As of June¬†30, 2025, we had $1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As the Revolving Credit and Term Credit Agreements‚Äô interest rate is calculated as Adjusted Term SOFR plus the spreads described above, its carrying amount is equivalent to its fair value as at June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, which was $170.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively. Senior NotesOn July¬†10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July¬†10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July¬†10, 2029, collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Senior Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement.Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to customary covenants including with respect to our corporate existence, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and other extraordinary transactions. We also agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, we will maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and will not at any time permit the amount of all priority secured and unsecured debt of us and our subsidiaries to exceed 10.0% of our consolidated tangible assets, determined as of the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter. This ratio is calculated at the end of each reporting period for which the Note Purchase Agreement requires us to deliver financial statements, using the results of the 12 consecutive month period ending with such reporting period.We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As of June¬†30, 2025 and June¬†30, 2024, the Senior Notes had a carrying amount of $500.0 million, excluding deferred borrowing costs, and an estimated fair value of $479.5 million and $463.0 million, respectively. Quoted market prices in active markets for identical liabilities based inputs (Level 2) were used to estimate fair value.At June¬†30, 2025, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $670.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. (9) Leases(a)Leases where Resmed is the LesseeWe determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. Right of use, or ROU, assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based upon the estimated present value of unpaid lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement in determining the present value of unpaid lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease commencement and any initial direct costs incurred and exclude any lease incentives received.We determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of the lease and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. Some of our leases include variable lease payments that are based on costs incurred or actual usage or adjusted periodically based on an index or a rate. Our leases do not contain any residual value guarantees and we do not account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We lease certain office space, warehouses and distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, vehicles, and equipment with remaining lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 17 years, some of which include options to extend or terminate the leases.-88-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC.

Device rental contracts are classified as operating leases, and contract terms vary by customer and include options to terminate or extend the contract. When lease contracts also include the sale of masks and accessories, we allocate contract consideration to those items on a relative standalone price basis and recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer. Operating lease revenue was $98.8 million, $92.9 million and $88.6 million for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.(10) Stockholders‚Äô Equity Common Stock. On February¬†21, 2014, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing us to acquire up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions, as market and business conditions warrant and subject to applicable legal requirements. The 20.0 million shares the program authorizes us to purchase are in addition to the shares we repurchased on or before February¬†21, 2014 under our previous programs. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. All share repurchases since February¬†21, 2014 have been executed in accordance with this program. During fiscal year 2025, we repurchased approximately 1,262,000 shares at a cost of $300.0 million. During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 828,000 shares at a cost of $150.0 million. As of June¬†30, 2025, we have repurchased a total of 43.9 million shares at a cost of $2.1 billion. Shares that are repurchased are classified as ‚Äútreasury stock pending future use‚Äù and reduce the number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share. At June¬†30, 2025, 10.8 million additional shares can be repurchased under the approved share repurchase program.Preferred Stock. In April 1997, our board of directors authorized 2.0 million shares of 0.01 par value preferred stock. No such shares were issued or outstanding at June¬†30, 2025. -89-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsStock Options and Restricted Stock Units. We have granted stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance restricted stock units, or PRSUs, to personnel, including officers and directors, in accordance with the ResMed Inc. 2009 Incentive Award Plan, as amended and restated, or the 2009 Plan. Options and restricted stock units vest over one year to four years and the options have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant. We have granted the options with an exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant. We have granted PRSUs that are subject to market conditions, with the ultimate realizable number of PRSUs dependent on both absolute and relative total stockholder return over a period of three years. The maximum amounts to be issued under the awards range from 200% to 225% of the original grant. We have also granted PRSUs that are subject to a performance condition based on meeting threshold levels of profitability measured by our actual adjusted earnings compared to board approved targeted levels of earnings.At the annual meeting of our stockholders in November 2017, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement to the 2009 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2009 Plan by 7.4 million. The amendment and restatement imposes a maximum award amount which may be granted under the 2009 Plan to a non-employee director in a calendar year, which when taken together with any other cash fees earned for services as a non-employee director during the calendar year, has a total value of $0.7 million, or $1.2 million in the case of a non-employee director who is also serving as chairman of our board of directors. The amendment and restatement also increased the maximum amount payable pursuant to cash-denominated performance awards granted in any calendar year from $3.0 million to $5.0 million. In addition, the amendment and restatement extended the existing prohibition on the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested awards to apply to all awards, including time-based restricted stock, deferred stock and stock payment. The term of the 2009 Plan was extended by four years so that the plan expires on September¬†11, 2027, unless otherwise amended or extended.The maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2009 Plan is 51.1 million. The number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2009 Plan at June¬†30, 2025 is 11.9 million. The number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2009 Plan will be reduced by (i) 2.8 shares for each one share of common stock delivered in settlement of any ‚Äúfull-value award,‚Äù which is any award other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or other award for which the holder pays a purchase price and (ii) one share for each share of common stock delivered in settlement of all other awards. The maximum number of shares, which may be subject to awards granted under the 2009 Plan to any individual during any calendar year, may not exceed 3 million shares of our common stock (except in a participant‚Äôs initial year of hiring up to 4.5 million shares of our common stock may be granted). In certain regions, shares are withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements upon exercise or vesting of awards. The number of shares withheld is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the trading day of the applicable settlement date. The remaining shares are delivered to the recipient as shares of our common stock. The amount remitted to the tax authorities for the employees‚Äô tax obligation is reflected as a financing activity on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Shares withheld by us as a result of the net settlement are not considered issued and outstanding and are added to the shares available for future issuance under the 2009 Plan.The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, was $45.3 million, $38.0 million and $28.7 million, respectively.The total fair value of PRSUs that vested during the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, was $10.3 million, $13.0 million, and $38.1 million, respectively.-90-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC.

As at June¬†30, 2025, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest were $42.8 million, $36.8 million and $42.5 million respectively.Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. Under the ESPP, we offer participants the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount during successive offering periods. Each offering period under the ESPP will be for a period of time determined by the board of directors‚Äô compensation committee of no less than 3 months and no more than 27 months. The purchase price for our common stock under the ESPP will be the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of purchase. An individual participant cannot subscribe for more than $25,000 in common stock during any calendar year. At June¬†30, 2025, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the ESPP is 0.8 million shares.During years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we issued 226,000, 323,000 and 220,000 shares to our employees in two offerings and we recognized $11.8 million, $11.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense associated with the ESPP.Stock‚Äìbased Employee compensation. We measure the compensation expense of all stock-based awards at fair value on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair values of RSUs and PRSUs subject to performance conditions are equal to the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to during the vesting period. The fair value of PRSUs that are subject to market conditions is measured using a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the service period for awards expected to vest.For the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we estimated the fair value of PRSUs that are measured using a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model, stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under the -91-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsESPP using the assumptions in the following tables. The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the U.S. Treasury yield curve and is based on the term of the award. The expected term of awards is estimated from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding.

(11) Earnings Per Share We compute basic earnings per share by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive -92-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementscommon stock equivalents such as stock options and restricted stock units. The weighted average number of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were 154,567, 603,859 and 272,104 for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

The valuation allowance at June¬†30, 2025 relates to a provision for uncertainty of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $0.6 million, capital loss of $28.8 million and other items of $0.6 million. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefits of deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance, will be realized.A substantial portion of our manufacturing operations and administrative functions in Singapore operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. The end of certain tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax holidays and tax incentive programs increased our net income by $67.4 million ($0.46 per diluted share) for the year ended June¬†30, 2025, $49.6 million ($0.34 per diluted share) for the year ended June¬†30, 2024, and $40.5 million ($0.27 per diluted share) for the year ended June¬†30, 2023. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, we have treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated. The total amount of these undistributed earnings at June¬†30, 2025 amounted to approximately $4.7 billion. In the event our non-U.S. earnings had not been permanently reinvested, approximately $5.9¬†million in U.S. state deferred taxes would have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.The TCJA also introduced U.S. taxation on certain global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. We have elected to account for tax expense attributable to GILTI tax as a period cost when incurred.In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management‚Äôs assessment is that the position is ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù (that is, a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term ‚Äútax position‚Äù -95-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsrefers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for annual periods. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Based on all known facts and circumstances and current tax law, we believe the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on June¬†30, 2025 is not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and if recognized, would not have a material impact on our effective tax rate.Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We are currently under audit by the ATO for the 2018 tax year. If any ongoing tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management‚Äôs expectations, the result could be a material adjustment to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results. Tax years 2018 to 2024 remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.(13) Segment Information We have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Breathing Health segment and the Residential Care Software segment. During fiscal year 2025, we renamed our operating segments from Sleep and Respiratory Care to Sleep and Breathing Health and from Software as a Service to Residential Care Software in alignment with our 2030 strategy. There have been no changes in the preparation and disclosure of financial information by operating segment. The identification of operating segments is based on our internal organizational structure and the information regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). Our CODM evaluates segment performance and makes resource allocation decisions based on net revenue and net operating profit. Impacts to segment net operating profit are referenced by our CODM when deciding to enter new markets, launch new products, reinvest profits, acquire or otherwise invest in other companies, and for monitoring actual results against forecasts. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2 ‚Äì Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Segment net sales and segment net operating profit do not include inter-segment profits and revenue is allocated to a geographic area based on where the products are shipped to or where the services are performed.Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments. The non-allocated items include corporate headquarters costs, stock-based compensation, amortization expense from acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, field safety notification expenses, acquisition related expenses, net interest expense (income), gains and losses attributable to equity method investments, gains and losses on equity investments, and other, net. We neither discretely allocate assets to our operating segments, nor does our CODM evaluate the operating segments using discrete asset information.Additionally, effective in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we updated the method of attribution of certain costs that are principally managed at the segment level as part of our evaluation of segment operating performance.

Details of the main plans are as follows: Australia We contribute to defined contribution plans for each employee resident in Australia at the rate of approximately 11.5% of salaries. Employees may contribute additional funds to the plans. All Australian employees, after serving a qualifying period, are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death. Our total contributions to the plans for the years ended June¬†30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were $15.9 million, $14.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. United States We sponsor a defined contribution plan available to substantially all domestic employees. Company contributions to this plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions to a maximum of 4.0% of the employee‚Äôs eligible compensation, subject to the annual IRS limit. Our total contributions to the plan were $12.7 million, $13.8 million and $12.7 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Singapore We sponsor a defined contribution plan available to all domestic employees. Company contributions to this plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions to a maximum of 17.0% of the employee‚Äôs salary. Our total contributions to the plan were $4.4 million, $3.9 million and $3.6 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.(15) Legal Actions, Contingencies and CommitmentsLitigationIn the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.On June 2, 2021, New York University, or NYU, filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court, District of Delaware against Resmed, case no. 1:21-cv-00813 (JPM). The complaint alleges that the AutoSet or AutoRamp features of Resmed‚Äôs AirSense 10 AutoSet flow generators infringe one or more claims of various NYU patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 6,988,994; 9,108,009; 9,168,344; 9,427,539; 9,533,115; 9,867,955; and 10,384,024. According to the complaint, the NYU patents are directed to systems and methods for diagnosis and treating sleeping disorders during different sleep states. The complaint seeks monetary damages and attorneys‚Äô fees. We answered the complaint on September 30, 2021 and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the patents are invalid because the subject matter of the patents is not patentable under the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent. The motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. In December 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the Patent and Trademark Office granted our request to review the validity of the claims in the patents asserted by NYU against us, determining that there is a reasonable likelihood that we will prevail. In December 2023, the PTAB issued written decisions invalidating each of the challenged claims in each of the NYU patents asserted against us. On December 28, 2023, the District Court entered an order continuing its stay of all proceedings against us pending any appeal by NYU of the invalidation of its patents by the PTAB. On January 31, 2024, NYU appealed the PTAB‚Äôs rulings to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefing has been completed and oral argument before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been scheduled in August 2025. On June 16, 2022, Cleveland Medical Devices Inc., or Cleveland Medical, filed suit for patent infringement against Resmed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, case no. 1:22-cv-00794. Cleveland Medical asserts that numerous Resmed connected devices, when combined with certain Resmed data platforms and/or software, including AirView and ResScan, infringe one or more of seven Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 10,076,269; 10,426,399; 10,925,535; 11,064,937; 10,028,698; 11,202,603; and 11,234,637. We moved to dismiss the action because Cleveland Medical sued the wrong Resmed entity, and to dismiss the indirect and willful infringement allegations by Cleveland Medical. On October 2, 2023, the court granted a portion of the motion, dismissing all Cleveland Medical claims for indirect and willful infringement, and denied the rest of the motion. On March 22, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB seeking review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 10,076,269. On May 6, 2024, the PTAB granted the petition and instituted an Inter Partes Review proceeding against the patent. On June 21, 2024, the District Court of Delaware granted Resmed's motion to stay the case until the PTAB issues its final written decision in the Inter Partes -99-Table of ContentsPART IIItem 8RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsReview proceeding. On May 2, 2025, the PTAB issued its decision finding all claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,076,269 unpatentable.On March 20, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, case no. 23-cv-00500-TWR-JLB, seeking a declaration that it does not infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284 issued to Cleveland Medical. In November 2023, the case was transferred to the Northern District of Ohio for the convenience of the parties. Cleveland Medical answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim asserting that ResMed Corp. infringes three additional Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 11,375,921; 11,690,512; and 11,786,680. On April 9, 2024, Cleveland Medical filed a second amended answer and counterclaims accusing ResMed Corp. of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 11,857,333 and 11,872,029. ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB for post-grant review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284, which the PTAB denied on June 24, 2024. On October 17, 2024, the PTAB denied ResMed Corp.‚Äôs request for rehearing of its decision to deny the petition for post-grant review of U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284.On October 11, 2024, ResMed Corp. filed a request for ex parte reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 11,375,921, and on November 15, 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the Patent Office, ordered reexamination of the patent. On October 17, 2024, ResMed Corp. filed a request for ex parte reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 11,786,680, and on December 3, 2024, the Patent Office ordered reexamination of the patent. Between November 15, 2024, and January 10, 2025, ResMed Corp. filed petitions with the PTAB seeking Inter Partes Review of the validity of all six patents asserted by Cleveland Medical in the District Court of the Northern District of Ohio proceedings. On March 7, 2025, the District Court of the Northern District of Ohio granted ResMed Corp.'s motion to stay the case pending the conclusion of all Patent Office proceedings related to the asserted patents. On June 10, 2025, the PTAB denied institution of Inter Partes Review directed to U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284. On June 12, 2025, the PTAB instituted an Inter Partes Review proceeding against U.S. Patent No. 11,375,921. On June 13, 2025, the PTAB instituted Inter Partes Review proceedings against U.S. Patent Nos. 11,690,512 and 11,786,680. On July 30, 2025, the PTAB instituted Inter Partes Review proceedings against U.S. Patent Nos. 11,857,333 and 11,872,029. The PTAB‚Äôs final written decisions in the instituted Inter Partes Review proceedings are expected by July 2026. Based on currently available information, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from matters that remain open.Contingent Obligations Under Recourse ProvisionsWe use independent financing institutions to offer some of our customers financing for the purchase of some of our products. Under these arrangements, if the customer qualifies under the financing institutions‚Äô credit criteria and finances the transaction, the customers repay the financing institution on a fixed payment plan. For some of these arrangements, the customer‚Äôs receivable balance is with limited recourse whereby we are responsible for repaying the financing company should the customer default. We record a contingent provision, which is estimated based on historical default rates. This is applied to receivables sold with recourse and is recorded in accrued expenses.During the year ended June¬†30, 2025 and 2024, receivables sold with limited recourse were $212.5 million and $206.7 million, respectively. As of June¬†30, 2025, the maximum exposure on outstanding receivables sold with recourse and contingent provision were $34.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIESMANAGEMENT‚ÄôS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii)Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June¬†30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management‚Äôs assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors. Based on that assessment under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that the company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June¬†30, 2025. KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ResMed Inc. included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.-105-Table of ContentsPART IIItems 9 ‚Äì 9CRESMED INC.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders‚Äô equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated August 7, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.Basis for OpinionThe Company‚Äôs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company‚Äôs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLPSan Diego, California August 7, 2025-106-Table of ContentsPART IIItems 9 ‚Äì 9CRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESITEM 9B OTHER INFORMATIONInsider Trading ArrangementsOur directors and executive officers may purchase or sell shares of our common stock in the market from time to time, including pursuant to equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and in compliance with guidelines specified by our insider trading policy. In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and our insider trading policy, directors, officers and certain employees who, at such time, are not in possession of material non-public information are permitted to enter into written plans that pre-establish amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares acquired pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the director or executive officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The use of these trading plans permits asset diversification as well as personal financial and tax planning. Our directors and executive officers also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, subject to compliance with SEC rules, the terms of our insider trading policy and certain minimum holding requirements. During the quarterly period ended June¬†30, 2025, none of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each term as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).Amendment of BylawsOn August 6, 2025, the board of directors approved and adopted Resmed‚Äôs Ninth Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective as of such date.
