Executive CompensationCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe discussion that follows describes the executive compensation program for our named executive officers (“NEOs”). This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) is intended to be read in conjunction with the tables immediately following this section, which provide further historical compensation information.The following executive officers constituted our NEOs for fiscal year 2025:NameTitleJohn C. Turner, Jr.President and Chief Executive OfficerScott M. DeakinSenior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCraig D. ApolinskySenior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate SecretaryLeigh R. DobbsSenior Vice President, Chief Human Resources OfficerGeorge T. HendrenSenior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer    I.    OverviewOur compensation program is designed to reward executives for achievement of the Company’s short- and long-term performance goals. Our Company’s performance is highly dependent on the talents, skills and engagement of our people. As such, our executive compensation program is designed to: (1) attract highly qualified individuals; (2) retain those individuals in a competitive marketplace for executive talent; and (3) motivate performance in a manner that supports achievement of our mission to increase stockholder value while ensuring these programs do not encourage excessive risk-taking.We believe our executive compensation program as developed and implemented, and as presented in this CD&A, achieves these objectives and is appropriate for a company in our industry and at our stage of growth.Pay Program OverviewWe believe the design and structure of our pay program, and in particular our incentive plans, support our business strategy and organizational objectives while successfully aligning executive focus and interest with our stockholders. Our compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate, and retain qualified and talented executives and to incent our executives to achieve our business goals and reward them for superior short- and long-term performance. All pay elements, and the safeguards and governance features of the program, have been carefully chosen and implemented to align with our pay philosophy and objectives.In doing so, we have developed the following compensation framework to achieve these objectives:Base SalaryFixed cash component of pay based on individual scope of experience and responsibilities, performance against goals, and peer and industry practices.Annual IncentivesVariable cash component of pay intended to motivate and reward our executives for the achievement of select strategic goals of the Company.In fiscal year 2025, our annual incentives continued to be based on two corporate performance metrics: (1) Adjusted EBITDA (weighted 80%) and (2) Working Capital Turns (weighted 20%).Long-TermEquity IncentivesVariable stock-based component of pay designed to motivate executives to deliver long-term stockholder value, while also providing a retention vehicle for our executive talent.In fiscal year 2025, equity awards were granted to our NEOs subject to three-year ratable vesting as follows:•    Stock Options (50%)•    Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) (50%)13Table of Contents2025 Target Pay MixConsistent with our philosophy of aligning executive pay with the short- and long-term performance of the Company, and to align the interests of management with those of our stockholders, the Company’s compensation programs are designed to provide a significant portion of executive compensation in the form of variable, at-risk, incentive pay as shown in the graphics below:Compensation Governance HighlightsThe Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee (“HCMC Committee”) regularly reviews best practices in executive compensation and uses the guidelines below to design our compensation programs.What We DoPPay-for-performance philosophy and culturePProvide an appropriate mix of performance-based compensation and time-vesting awards to executivesPResponsible use of shares under our long-term incentive programPStock ownership requirements for all executives and non-executive directorsPEngage an independent compensation consultantPPerform an annual risk assessment of our compensation programWhat We
Don't DoXNo repricing of stock option awards without shareholder approvalXNo resetting of financial targets for performance-based incentive awardsXNo excessive prerequisitesXNo single trigger vesting of equity following a change-in-controlConsideration of Last Year’s Say-on-Pay VoteAt the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay proposal received strong support, garnering support from 98% of shares cast. The Company is pleased with these results and believes that stockholders have a positive view of our executive compensation philosophy, policies and programs. The HCMC Committee took these results into account by continuing to emphasize our pay-for-performance philosophy which utilizes performance measures that provide incentives to deliver value to our stockholders.14Table of ContentsII.    Executive Compensation Philosophy and ObjectivesThe objectives of the executive compensation program included the following:•    balancing an entrepreneurial focus with the need to set and achieve pre-determined goals;•    aligning with best practices and standards as determined by peer practices and institutional stockholders;•    basing annual reward opportunities on performance measures linked to stockholders’ value creation;•    providing substantial, but capped, upside on cash incentives that is linked to superior performance; and•    requiring a threshold level of performance in order for any cash award to be earned.III.    Pay ComponentsBase SalaryWe believe that base salary plays an important role in attracting and retaining top executive talent by providing executives with a predictable level of income. Base salaries represent a fixed portion of our NEOs’ compensation and vary by job responsibility. The HCMC Committee reviews our NEOs’ base salaries annually, however, the HCMC Committee
may make periodic base salary adjustments in connection with an NEO’s promotion, change in job responsibility, or when otherwise necessary for equitable reasons. In connection with its review and determination of base salaries, the HCMC Committee considers market data, the level of the executive’s compensation (individually and relative to the other executives), the level of the executive’s performance and, for the base salaries for executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. The following table sets forth our NEOs’ base salaries for fiscal 2025:ExecutiveFiscal 2024Base SalaryFiscal 2025Base Salary% ChangeJohn C. Turner, Jr.$865,000 $925,000 6.9%Scott M.

Hendren517,500 560,000 8.2%15Table of ContentsAnnual IncentivesThe Company maintains the Annual Incentive Plan (the “AIP”) in order to drive the Company’s annual performance by linking variable compensation payments to achievement of Company performance. Cash incentives under the AIP are designed to support our strategic business, promote the maximization of Company profitability and encourage teamwork. In fiscal 2025, each of our NEOs was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive under the AIP, subject to the conditions described below.
Under the AIP, the HCMC Committee takes into consideration the Company’s performance as measured against pre-established business and/or financial goals at different levels of the Company’s operating structure. The table below outlines the structure of our fiscal 2025 annual cash incentives:MetricWeightingRationaleAdjusted EBITDA80%•Adjusted EBITDA serves as a key measure of our profitabilityWorking Capital Turns20%•Working Capital Turns measures our operating efficiency and inventory managementBoth are key performance metrics assessed by shareholders that drive the creation of shareholder value and are used by management to assess the Company’s performance.For fiscal 2025, the HCMC Committee approved each NEO’s target cash incentive opportunity (expressed as a percentage of base salary), as set forth in the table below. Based on company performance against the pre-established performance goals, NEOs may earn between 0% and 200% of their target cash incentive opportunities. If threshold performance goals are not achieved, NEOs would not be entitled to any payout under the AIP. The annual incentives under the AIP are subject to adjustment by the HCMC Committee, at its discretion, based on the executive’s individual performance and contribution to the Company during the year.
The following table sets forth the annual cash incentive target, expressed as a percentage of base salary, for our NEOs for fiscal 2025 (Mr. Turner’s target increased from 100% in fiscal 2024 and Mr. Deakin’s target increased from 60% fiscal 2024 based on performance and to remain competitive.

Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is an amount equal to net income (loss) plus interest expense and related items, income taxes, stock compensation, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude other non-cash items 16Table of Contentsand certain other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not determined in accordance with GAAP, and is not intended to present a superior measure of the financial condition from those determined under GAAP.(2)Actual performance was adjusted to remove Adjusted EBITDA of current-year acquisitions that were not included in performance targets established at the beginning of the fiscal year.(3)Working Capital Turns equals the 12 month trailing average of trade accounts and notes receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, divided by annual net sales. Based on the Company’s actual performance in fiscal 2025 and interpolation applied for performance, Adjusted EBITDA was paid out at 0% of target and Working Capital Turns was paid out at 83.0% of target, for a total weighted annual cash incentive performance payout of 16.6% of target. The HCMC Committee did not exercise its discretion to adjust annual cash incentive amounts based on the executive’s individual performance and contribution to the Company during the year.

Apolinsky46,580 Leigh R. Dobbs40,263 George T. Hendren55,776 Long-Term Incentive PlanThe Company maintains a long-term incentive plan under which we may make grants of equity awards. The main objectives of the long-term incentive plan are to (1) directly link the executives to increasing stockholder value, (2) incentivize our executives to work towards the achievement of our long-term performance goals, (3) provide the Company a competitive means through which we may better attract talented individuals to become executives, and (4) retain executives by providing these individuals with stock ownership opportunities vesting over multiple years. For the foregoing reasons, we believe providing our NEOs long-term equity compensation further advances and aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders. As described below in the Compensation Determination Process section, each year the HCMC Committee reviews the results of a benchmarking study to determine the appropriate mix of equity awards and total grant date value of equity awards that will be granted to each NEO. In determining the number of shares subject to each type of equity award, we use the grant date closing stock price for full value awards and the grant date Black-Scholes value for stock options.In fiscal 2025, we granted a mix of the following equity awards:Equity AwardWeightingVesting ScheduleRationaleRSUs50% of grant valueTime-based over three years, with equal installments vesting on each annual anniversary subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions)•Long-term incentives granted in equity to align NEOs with shareholder outcomesStock Options50% of grant value•Stock options motivate executives to build long-term shareholder value by only providing value if share price increases•RSUs encourage executive retention with the value varying based on shareholder outcomes17Table of Contents    In July 2024, the HCMC Committee approved our annual equity award grants to our NEOs under the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan. These annual equity grants were made on August 1, 2024.

Our HCMC Committee regularly reports to our Board on its deliberations but is ultimately responsible for executive compensation decisions.Our HCMC Committee reviews, on at least an annual basis, our executive compensation program, including our incentive compensation plans, to determine whether they are appropriate, properly coordinated, and achieve their intended purposes. It also reviews the compensation of our executive officers and makes decisions about the various components that comprise their compensation packages.The appropriate mix and amount of compensation for each executive officer varies based on the level of the executive’s responsibilities. The HCMC Committee does not maintain any formal policy or formula for allocating the appropriate mix of compensation, as it believes it is more important to remain flexible to respond to shifts in the marketplace in which the Company must compete to recruit and retain executive talent. Therefore, the HCMC Committee retains the authority to review our executive officers’ compensation periodically and to use its discretion to adjust the mix of compensation and the amount of any element of compensation as it deems appropriate.Role of ManagementThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with our Chief Human Resources Officer and other Company representatives, provides input and recommendations to the HCMC Committee on the design of our executive compensation program and compensation decisions for executive officers other than himself. The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations based on his assessment of the Company and each executive’s performance, as well as market data provided by the Committee’s executive compensation consultant. The HCMC Committee reviews and considers the Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations when considering any compensation changes affecting our executive officers, but it retains approval authority. The HCMC Committee meets regularly in executive session without management present. 18Table of ContentsRole of Compensation ConsultantFor fiscal year 2025, the HCMC Committee retained the services of its independent executive compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”), to advise the HCMC Committee on compensation matters related to the Company’s executive officers and non-employee directors. During fiscal year 2025, Meridian assisted the HCMC Committee with, among other things:•assessing market data on executive and director compensation pay levels and program structures;•reviewing and making changes to the compensation peer group;•developing and refining our executive and director compensation programs;•advising the HCMC Committee on the design of the annual and long-term incentive programs;•staying apprised of market trends and regulatory developments related to executive and director compensation; and•reviewing our fiscal year 2025 CD&A.Use of Peer Group DataTo assess the appropriateness of our executive compensation program and compensation levels, our HCMC Committee, with the assistance of Meridian, examines the competitive compensation data for senior executives of our peer companies. The HCMC Committee uses the peer group to reference recent market data and understand the marketplace but does not establish compensation based on a specific percentile of the market data. The HCMC Committee also recognizes the importance of flexibility and considers other factors as well when setting executive compensation, such as individual performance, experience, history and scope of responsibility, current market conditions and the specific needs of the business at critical points in time.During fiscal year 2025, Meridian presented a compensation benchmarking study to the HCMC Committee at its request, which included market data derived from public filings of the peer group companies listed below as well as broader market survey data relevant for our industry and size. The HCMC Committee used the benchmarking study as a comparative tool in its evaluation of the Company’s executive compensation program in relation to companies believed to represent the appropriate comparable labor market for executive talent and to provide context for executive compensation.The peer group was evaluated by Meridian using criteria including the following:•Industry and Business Mix: companies with comparable lines of business (generally distribution and building products)•Size and Scope: companies with revenues generally within 1/3rd to 3x GMS with comparable margins and market capitalization•Company Type: publicly-traded companies operating primarily in the U.S.Based on Meridian's evaluation, the HCMC Committee approved the following peer group of 17 companies for fiscal 2025(1):A.O. Smith CorporationBoise Cascade CompanyPool CorporationApplied Industrial Technologies, Inc.Core & Main, Inc.Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc.Armstrong World Industries, Inc.Fastenal CompanySiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc.Atkore International Group Inc.JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.TopBuild Corp.Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.Lennox International Inc.Watsco, Inc.BlueLinx Holdings, Inc.MSC Industrial Direct Co. Inc.___________________________________19Table of Contents(1)Masonite International Corporation was removed from the peer group that was used in fiscal 2024. There were no other changes from the peer group used in fiscal 2024.Risk Analysis of Compensation ProgramThe HCMC Committee reviewed our compensation program to determine if the program encourages excessive or unnecessary risk taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The HCMC Committee believes that the Company’s compensation program provides an appropriate balance of fixed compensation, short- and long-term variable compensation, and strong governance practices to help mitigate unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. As a result, the HCMC Committee believes our compensation program does not encourage unreasonable risk taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.V.    Additional Compensation Practices and PoliciesStock Ownership GuidelinesThe Company has stock ownership guidelines for our senior leaders and independent members of the Board to further align the interests of our senior leaders and independent members of the Board with our stockholders. Pursuant to these guidelines, each senior leader or independent member of the Board is required to own specified levels of our common stock. Individuals are required to hold 50% of net shares they receive from vesting of restricted share units or the exercise of stock options until they have met the required ownership level. All NEOs and Board members have met or are on track to meet share ownership guidelines. PositionRequirementChief Executive Officer5x base salaryOther Named Executive Officers1.5x base salaryNon-executive directors5x annual cash retainerIncentive Compensation Clawback PolicyWe maintain a clawback policy that complies with the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act. In the event of a restatement of the reported financial results of the Company due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, the HCMC Committee will recover reasonably promptly the amount of all erroneously awarded compensation received by an executive officer during the covered period (within the meaning of such terms as provided in the NYSE listing standards).Retirement BenefitsThe Company provides retirement benefits to the NEOs, including matching contributions, under the terms of its tax-qualified defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”). The NEOs participate in the 401(k) Plan on the same terms as our other participating employees. We believe the retirement benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan are analogous to those provided by comparable companies. The Company does not maintain any defined benefit or supplemental retirement plans for any of its executive officers. Severance and Change in Control PaymentsWe believe employment agreements assist us in attracting and retaining executive talent and that change in control provisions are appropriate to help ensure continuity of management during a potential change in control. We have employment agreements with each of our NEOs and each agreement contains termination and change in control provision. The GMS Inc. Equity Incentive Plan provides that, in connection with a change in control, the HCMC Committee will determine whether outstanding awards will either: (a) be assumed or substituted for, with appropriate adjustments to the number, kind of shares, and exercise prices of the awards; or (b) terminate. Beginning with equity awards granted in August 2019, we implemented double-trigger change of control vesting provisions in our equity award agreements. Under this provision, if upon the occurrence of a change of control, the surviving entity assumes or otherwise equitably converts or substitutes the awards, then vesting will be accelerated only if a participant’s employment is terminated without “cause” or the participant resigns for “good reason” within two years after the change of control effective date. Vesting will also be 20Table of Contentsaccelerated if the awards are not assumed, equitably converted or substituted in a manner approved by the HCMC Committee or the Board. This change in control feature is included in the GMS Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan approved by our shareholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. More information about the NEOs’ employment agreements is provided in the section “Employment Agreements” on page 26, and more information about their potential payments is provided in the section “—Payments upon Certain Events of Termination or Change in Control” beginning on page 26.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Company provides NEOs the opportunity to purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount from the market price under the GMS Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The NEOs participate in the ESPP on the same terms as our other participating employees. We believe that the benefits provided under the ESPP are analogous to those provided by comparable companies. All of our NEOs participated in the ESPP during fiscal 2025.Perquisites and Other Personal BenefitsThe Company provides the NEOs with limited perquisites and other personal benefits that it believes are reasonable and consistent with its overall compensation program to better enable the Company to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. We believe that these benefits enable our executives to focus on our business and enhance their commitment to us. In fiscal 2025, our NEOs each received $800 per month in a car allowance and premium credit cards. Our NEOs may also receive an executive physical exam and a tax gross up for such physical exam. The HCMC Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs to confirm such levels are reasonable and continue to serve their intended retentive purposes.Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider ParticipationMr. Smith, Mr. Gilliam, Ms. McClure and Mr. Southern were members of the HCMC Committee during fiscal 2025, none of whom was an officer or employee of the Company at any time. None of our executive officers serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other committee performing equivalent functions) of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or HCMC Committee. None of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee of an entity that has an executive officer serving as a director on the Board. No interlocking relationship exists between any member of our HCMC Committee (or other committee performing equivalent functions) and any executive, member of the board of directors or member of the compensation committee (or other committee performing equivalent functions) of any other company.Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee ReportThe HCMC Committee has reviewed and discussed the above Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on its review and discussion with management, the HCMC Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2025.J.

Turner, Apolinsky, Deakin and Hendren and Ms. Dobbs, each of which had an initial one-year term commencing on May 1, 2019, July 20, 2015, October 21, 2019, August 1, 2022 and September 6, 2023, respectively, in each case with automatic one-year renewals unless and until either the Company or the executive provides at least 90 days’ written notice to the other of intent not to renew the term of the agreement. The employment agreements provide that each executive is entitled to base salary, target annual bonus and eligibility for participation in the Company’s benefit plans, as well as a car allowance.
The employment agreements also provide for severance upon certain terminations of employment, as described below under “— Payments upon Certain Events of Termination or Change in Control.”
PAYMENTS UPON CERTAIN EVENTS OF TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROLTermination Payments. Pursuant to the terms of their respective Employment Agreements, as applicable, our NEOs are entitled to receive certain payments in connection with certain termination events.

This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. Given the different methodologies various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported below should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.We determined our median employee as of April 30, 2025. We identified our median employee by using a consistently applied compensation definition and chose total gross wages for all employees, excluding the CEO. We selected the median employee from our employee population (full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal) of 7,113 individuals employed as of April 30, 2025.Compensation Measure Used to Identify Median EmployeeTotal gross wages as derived from the Company’s payroll recordsMedian Employee Fiscal 2025 Annual Compensation$72,368, calculated in the same manner as we calculated total compensation of the CEO in the Summary Compensation TableCEO Fiscal 2025 Annual Compensation$4,636,439, as reported in the Summary Compensation TablePay Ratio64:128Table of ContentsDIRECTOR COMPENSATIONDirector Compensation ProgramThe HCMC is responsible for oversight of the compensation program for non-employee directors.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director IndependenceCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSOur Board has adopted a written policy providing that the Audit Committee will review and approve or ratify transactions in excess of $120,000 of value in which we participate and in which a director, executive officer or beneficial holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under this policy, the Board is to obtain all information it believes to be relevant to a review and approval or ratification of these transactions. After consideration of the relevant information, the Audit Committee is to approve only those related party transactions that the Audit Committee believes are on their terms, taken as a whole, no less favorable to us than could be obtained in an arms’-length transaction with an unrelated third party and that the Audit Committee determines are not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company. In particular, our policy with respect to related person transactions will require our Audit Committee to consider the benefits to the Company, the impact on a director’s independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director has a position or relationship, the availability of other sources for comparable products or services, the terms of the transaction and the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. A “related person” is any person who is or was one of our executive officers, directors or director nominees or is a holder of more than 5% of our common stock, or their immediate family members or any entity owned or controlled by any of the foregoing persons. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, there were no transactions to which we were a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our executive officers, directors or holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or an affiliate or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCENYSE listing standards require us to have a majority of independent directors on our Board. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and NYSE listing standards, a director is not independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that he or she does not have a material relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines define independence in accordance with the independence definition in the current NYSE corporate governance rules for listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require our Board to review the independence of all directors at least annually. In the event a director has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the objective tests set forth in the NYSE independence definition, our Board will determine, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, whether such relationship is material.Our Board is currently comprised of one management director and eight non-management directors. Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of our eight non-management directors, Lisa M. Bachmann, John J. Gavin, Theron I. Gilliam, Mitchell B. Lewis, Teri P. McClure, Randolph W. Melville, J. David Smith and W. Bradley Southern, are independent directors under the rules of the NYSE and independent directors as such term is defined in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. Mr. John C. Turner, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer, our only management director, is not independent because of his position as an executive officer of the Company. 34Table of ContentsItem 14.

The policy authorizes the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more of its members pre-approval authority with respect to permitted services.35Table of ContentsPOLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT RELATEDSERVICES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORSThe Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight, and termination of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring substantially all audit, audit-related and non-audit services provided by the independent auditor be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval is not necessary for certain minor non-audit services that (i) do not constitute more than 5% of the total amount paid by the Company to its independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal year the non-audit services were provided; (ii) were not recognized by the Company to be non-audit services at the time of the engagement for such services; and (iii) are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more members of the Audit Committee who are members of the Board to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may delegate authority to one or more independent members of the Audit Committee to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided any such pre-approvals are presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that prohibits our independent auditors from providing the following services:•    bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Company;•    financial information systems design and implementation;•    appraisal or valuation services, providing fairness opinions or preparing contribution-in-kind reports;•    actuarial services;•    internal audit outsourcing services;•    management functions or human resources;•    broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services;•    legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and•    any other service the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board prohibits through regulation.The Audit Committee’s pre-approval policy is included in the Audit Committee Charter, which is available on our website at investor.gms.com/governance/governance-documents.36Table of ContentsPART IVItem 15.
