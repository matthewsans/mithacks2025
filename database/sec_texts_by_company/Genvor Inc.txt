PART I
Item 1: Business
Genvor Incorporated (the “Company”
or “Genvor”) was incorporated in Florida on September 26, 2018, as “Allure Worldwide, Inc.,” and as of
November 18, 2019, redomiciled to Nevada. On June 24, 2022, the Company changed its name to from “Allure Worldwide, Inc.”
to “Genvor Incorporated.”
The Company was originally formed with
the intention of seeking to acquire the assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in
exchange for its securities. On January 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
with Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old Genvor”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) Old Genvor. On March
2, 2022, the Company and Old Genvor entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to consummate the Acquisition,
and pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Genvor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger
Subsidiary”), merged (the “Merger”) with and into Old Genvor, with each share of Old Genvor common stock issued
immediately prior to the time of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the
Company.
On May 27, 2022, the Acquisition closed,
Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Old Genvor, each share of Old Genvor was exchanged for the right to receive one share of
Company common stock, 35,261,871 shares of Company common stock were issued to Old Genvor’s pre-merger shareholders (the
“Merger Shares”), constituting a change of control of the Company, and Old Genvor became a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company had 55,261,871 issued and outstanding common shares upon the closing
of the Acquisition, and subsequently the Company’s original founding shareholders cancelled 18,144,112 shares of Company
common stock in connection with the Acquisition.
Business Overview and Strategic Direction
As a result of the Acquisition, the Company’s
business plan is to continue the research, development, and future commercialization of sustainable crop protection and plant health
solutions through its wholly owned subsidiary, Genvor. Genvor leverages a proprietary and growing library of patented peptides
to address critical challenges in global agriculture. These peptides, which include antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and nutritionally
enhanced peptides (NEPs), are being developed to support plant defense against a wide spectrum of threats, including pathogens
(fungi, bacteria, and viruses), toxins, and pest-related crop damage.
In addition to direct disease resistance,
Genvor’s peptide technologies show promising potential in other vital areas of crop protection and productivity. These include
improved nutrient uptake efficiency, plant vigor, and stress tolerance, as well as insect control through naturally derived, targeted
bioactive mechanisms. These multifunctional properties of peptides may lead to reductions in chemical pesticide usage and enhanced
yield outcomes, contributing to more sustainable and economically viable farming systems.
The company believes these technologies,
once commercialized, may provide material benefits to growers globally by mitigating losses from plant disease and environmental
stress, thereby supporting increased yields and improved food security in regions facing agricultural constraints.
Beyond plant health, Genvor is also evaluating
cross-sector applications of its peptide portfolio in animal health. Early research and collaboration opportunities are exploring
the use of nutritionally enhanced peptides (NEPs) to improve feed efficiency, gut health, and overall performance in livestock
and aquaculture systems. These applications align with global efforts to enhance protein production efficiency across the food
chain, reduce reliance on antibiotics, and improve sustainability in animal agriculture.
The Company’s strategic vision includes
both internal development and external partnerships to accelerate the validation, regulatory approval, and commercialization of
its core peptide technologies across plant and animal sectors. Genvor’s integrated approach to biological innovation places
it at the intersection of agricultural productivity, environmental stewardship, and food system resilience.
Genvor’s History
The Company’s subsidiary, Genvor
Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 4, 2019, as “Nexion Biosciences Inc.,” and
on January 22, 2020, its name was changed to “Genvor Inc.” Genvor Inc. develops sustainable plant health solutions,
designed to provide crops with anti-pathogen and enhanced nutritional properties.
During May 2019, Genvor Inc. acquired Nexion
Biosciences LLC (“NBLLC”) from its founder for nominal consideration. NBLLC was formed in the State of Delaware on
December 28, 2018.
4
Genvor’s technology was developed
by two university scientists, Dr. Clayton Yates and Dr. Jesse Jaynes, who share a common mission to develop crop protection technology
to defend against deadly crop diseases, which ultimately impact both animals and humans alike.
Dr. Jaynes has, over decades, focused on
perfecting techniques for synthesizing and modifying anti-microbial peptides (“AMPs”).1
Genvor’s headquarters is located
at 1550 W Horizon Ridge Pkwy, Ste R #3040, Henderson, Nevada.
Genvor’s Operations
Overview
Genvor is a research and development (“R&D”)
company advancing the next generation of sustainable plant and animal health solutions through its proprietary library of patented
peptides. The Company’s platform centers on the development of anti-microbial peptides (“AMPs”), which are designed
to combat a broad spectrum of debilitating and destructive plant diseases—including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens—that
threaten crop productivity worldwide. These peptides are being developed for two primary agricultural applications: (1) as a non-chemical
transgenic seed trait, whereby crops are engineered to express specific AMPs internally; and (2) as a topical or foliar biological
spray application (“bio-pesticide”) that can be used in integrated pest and disease management strategies.
These peptide-based solutions are intended
to help farmers worldwide increase crop health and yield while reducing dependence on conventional petrochemical-based pesticides.
According to industry research, global crop losses attributed to plant disease exceed $220 billion annually.² Genvor’s
innovations aim to provide a sustainable, environmentally responsible alternative using naturally occurring peptide compounds to
enhance plants' innate immune responses, reduce pathogen colonization, and mitigate yield losses.
Beyond disease resistance, Genvor’s
proprietary peptide library also includes peptide candidates designed to support improved nutrient uptake, plant vigor, and stress
resilience. These multifunctional peptides are being evaluated for their potential to increase agricultural efficiency and reduce
input costs, with promising results across various crop types.
In addition to its agricultural applications,
Genvor is expanding its research into nutritionally enhanced peptides (“NEPs”) for use in animal feed. These NEPs have
demonstrated the potential to increase protein expression in feed crops such as corn and sweet potato by 5–10x, which could
improve feed efficiency and nutrient density in poultry, swine, and aquaculture systems. This development represents a potential
cross-sector opportunity to enhance sustainability and economic return in the broader animal protein value chain.
All of Genvor’s peptides are composed
of naturally derived amino acid sequences and are developed without the use of toxic chemicals. As a result, adoption of these
technologies could contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved soil health, and alignment with regenerative agriculture
practices. The Company believes these innovations will translate into meaningful economic and environmental benefits for a range
of growers, from conventional to organic operations.
Genvor’s mission is to provide scalable
biological solutions to address some of the most pressing challenges in global agriculture and food production, supporting yield
improvements, reduced environmental impact, and increased food system resilience. The Company is pursuing regulatory pathways and
strategic collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of its peptide technologies for both domestic and international
markets.
Below is a summary of Genvor’s peptide
development process.

Commercialization of Genvor’s peptide
technologies is a key strategic priority, with an initial focus on developing seed trait integrations for major row crops such
as corn, soybeans, and cotton. These transgenic applications aim to embed Genvor’s proprietary anti-microbial peptides (AMPs)
directly into the plant genome, enabling continuous, internal expression of disease-resistant traits throughout the crop lifecycle.
In parallel, the Company is advancing the development of a topical or foliar spray formulation—classified as a biological
pesticide—for foliar application across a broad range of crops. This foliar application offers a more immediate regulatory
path and near-term market entry opportunity while serving as a complementary tool to trait-based solutions.
Concurrently, Genvor is pursuing research
and validation of its nutritionally enhanced peptides (NEPs), which are designed to significantly increase the protein content
and feed efficiency of common animal feedstocks such as corn and sweet potato. These peptides are intended to support performance
improvements across poultry, swine, and aquaculture production systems, potentially reducing feed conversion ratios and contributing
to more sustainable and profitable animal protein production.
The Company’s peptide platform is
protected by a robust intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Genvor currently holds two issued United States patents covering a
core library of 24 proprietary peptides and thousands of other design candidates and has a third patent pending that covers an
additional 16 peptides. These peptides represent a diversified pipeline of bioactive compounds under evaluation for applications
across plant health, nutrient optimization, pest control, and animal feed enhancement.
The following chart outlines Genvor’s
development pipeline, highlighting the current stage of each peptide candidate and its associated crop or livestock application.
This visual summary reflects the Company’s integrated and multi-sector approach to biological innovation, with both near-
and long-term opportunities across agricultural and animal protein health markets.

Addressing a $220 Billion Global
Economic and Health Risk with Proven Solutions
Food production must double by 2050 to
meet the food demand of the global population’s expected growth to 9.6 billion people. Annual crop losses due to plant pathogens
and viruses are now estimated to exceed $220 billion globally.3 Alarming to the United States Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) is the fungi “Aspergillus Flavus,” which produces Aflatoxins, a toxic carcinogenic compound known
to cause liver cancer in humans and animals. Humans infected with Aspergillus Flavus often have reduced or compromised immune systems.
Contamination of corn with acutely toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxin is a major human and livestock health risk, estimated to cost
the U.S. corn industry between $52 million and $1.7 billion annually.4
The below image shows an infected crop
leaf, a common sight for farmers facing these types of crop contamination issues:
Aflatoxin contamination causes market rejection
of infected crops, as well as animal and human health impacts. The USDA has imposed strict guidelines for crop inspection and discovery
of diseased crops caused by Aflatoxins. Both planted fields and harvested crops found to be contaminated exceeding permitted testing
levels must be destroyed, at a loss to the farmer, who is often exposed to catastrophic economic losses as a result. The guidelines
in the European Union are stricter than in the United States, creating a critical market need for sustainable and effective plant
health solutions to combat such plant disease.5
Industry observers have noted that seed
trait expression of AMPs is a promising approach to providing resistance to aflatoxin infection in corn.6 Testing of
Genvor’s AMPs by the US Department of Agriculture over a period of six years, the results of which were published in May
2018 and March 2023, showed promising results in defense against aflatoxins, as seeds infused with Genvor AMPs showed a 70% reduction
in aflatoxin contamination, making them promising candidates for genetic engineering the next-generation of disease-resistant crops.7
Application of Peptides in Plant
Protection
Plant pathogens attack crops and lead to
serious adverse impacts on their growth. Traditional chemical fungicides are effective in preventing diseases caused by plant pathogens;
however, their long-term continuous use has led to plant pathogens developing resistance to those fungicides, and their residues
present a risk of harm to humans and the environment. Industry observers believe that more sustainable methods to control plant
diseases are urgently needed.8 Naturally occurring AMPs mediate the innate host defense and can be used as immune inducers.
Given their high specificity, rapid degradation, and efficacy, AMPs are expected to be a promising first line of defense against
fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Some industry observers believe that peptides will likely become mainstream tools for plant protection
in the future.9

The following is an illustration that shows
the mode of action of Genvor’s peptides against a disease cell:
Genvor’s AMP Technology has
Created Significant Economic Opportunities in a Broad Spectrum of Plant Types
The Aflatoxin problem has created significant
opportunities for companies developing the technology needed to defend against Aflatoxins. AMPs, such as those developed by Genvor,
are a safer alternative to fungicides. Pesticides or fungicides with a chemical composition are known to degrade the environment,
are inefficient to apply, persist in crops and livestock, and are less effective as plant pathogen resistance increases. AMPs kill
microorganisms directly, resistance to them is rare and should remain so given their mode of action, and AMPs can be manufactured
via a non-GMO process.
Genvor’s peptides have proven effective
on corn and show broad spectrum effectiveness for other crop types11 for most known bacteria and fungi within a single
product solution. This broad-spectrum efficacy should be more efficient for farmers compared to the toxic fungicide alternatives,
which are currently used to combat a single fungi or bacteria type. Genvor’s technology can be delivered into plants by both
bioengineered seed traits, as well as through bio-fungicide (topical spray) application.11 There is no evidence of pathogens
developing resistance to Genvor’s designed AMPs. At this point in time, AMPs show a likelihood of killing pathogens in berries,
corn, cannabis, wheat, cotton, citrus, and peanuts.
Genvor utilizes a proprietary peptide design
and development methodology originally conceived by its founder, Dr. Jesse Jaynes. This method is rooted in a phenotype-driven
model first developed in the mid-1980s, which enables the expedited identification, optimization, and functional testing of bioactive
peptides. The approach is designed to accelerate the discovery process while improving peptide efficacy through targeted structure-activity
modeling.
This methodology has been refined over
several decades and has demonstrated utility across multiple domains, including agricultural crop protection, animal health, and
human health research. Genvor continues to apply and evolve this model to support the rapid development of novel peptides with
applications in plant disease resistance, nutrient enhancement, pest management, and feed efficiency improvement. The Company believes
this foundational platform provides a strategic advantage in both speed to market and the functional performance of its proprietary
peptide candidates.

What are Peptides Exactly?
Peptides are broadly utilized in medicine,
cosmetics, healthcare products, animal nutrition and health, and plant nutrition and protection. In recent years, they’ve
become active research subjects to protect plants from bacteria, viruses, pests, and weeds, as antimicrobial and immune inducers,
plant growth regulators, insecticides, and herbicides. This is due to their extensive raw material sources, excellent activity,
and ideal environmental compatibility.
Peptides are short-chain biomolecules of
between 2 and 50 amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. Based on their sources, peptides can be categorized as natural or artificially
synthesized. Most natural peptides are from animals, plants, and microorganisms. Both natural and synthetic peptides can be produced
through chemical synthesis, biological fermentation, gene recombination and other methods. Peptides are ubiquitous in living organisms
and modulate many physiological processes, making them a common research subject in medicine, cosmetics, and agriculture.12
How do Peptides Work Against Diseases?
Through seed traits, plant seeds are genetically
coded to produce AMPs. Upon encountering a disease microbe, AMPs penetrate the cell wall of the target disease microbe, causing
the contents of the disease microbe to spill out, destroying the disease cell. The same effect is foreseen in the utilization of
the topical spray.
Delivery by Transgenic Seed Traits
In North America, the seed trait market
is currently estimated to exceed $10 billion. The adoption of crop seeds with enhanced traits has been staggering with over 75%
of U.S. corn, cotton and soybeans being produced using seeds with enhanced traits.13
The following image shows corn with Genvor’s
seed traits, which is currently growing in a USDA facility for study:

Delivery by Topical Spray (Bio-fungicide)
The rising global demand for organic foods,
the trend in the reduction of chemical residues, stricter import and supermarket standards, shorter pre-harvest intervals, a push
for sustainability, growing food scarcity, the phase out of synthetic agricultural chemicals, along with the market’s demand
for additional modes of action to manage resistance, has resulted in biologicals being one of the fastest-growing sectors in the
crop protection market, increasing at twice the compound annual growth rate of the crop protection market as a whole.14 The
global agricultural biologicals market was approximately $9.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to approximately $19.7 billion
by 2026.15 Unlike synthetic chemicals, bio-fungicides are derived from configurations of amino acids and proteins occurring
in nature; therefore they do not contaminate soil, water, turf, beneficial insects, birds, fish, and non-targeted plants.16
USDA Partnership – Benefits
of a CRADA
Genvor’s AMPs gained the attention
of the USDA in its pursuit of solutions for plant disease in corn, the U.S.’s largest crop. Based on over 30 years of research
by Genvor founder Dr. Jesse Jaynes, Genvor was awarded a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) in
2018 to develop and commercialize disease resistance and nutritional enhancement in corn seed based upon Genvor’s proven
technology. A CRADA expands expertise and speeds development of many technologies that are now used by farmers or found in the
grocery store through access to USDA resources such as advanced laboratories, increasing the chances that research outcomes are
adopted commercially to maximize impact, driving a significantly lower overhead rate than a university’s research program,
and creating a multi-disciplinary research team to increase technical breadth and depth of the lab. In addition, a CRADA provides
access to the USDA regulatory team for registrations and processes.
Genvor’s Peptides are proven
effective in corn seed traits.
As a result of the USDA and Genvor partnership
through the CRADA, the effectiveness of Genvor’s solutions in protecting against Aflatoxins in corn seed has been established,
with the probability that this technology can effectively be applied to other crop types.17 Genvor is expecting an extension
of the CRADA to continue the studies of Genvor’s 4th generation of its peptides (GNV-185 and GNV-187) towards
commercialization. The Company now has the technology to move its superior AMPs from the research lab and greenhouse to the field,
with the goal of commercially producing Genvor’s AMPs at a desirable price point for cost-effective and broad-based agricultural
use.
What is a USDA CRADA Worth to Genvor?
In the United States, it often takes eight
years and $136 million to develop and bring a new seed trait through regulatory to the marketplace.18 The value of a
CRADA, utilizing the USDA’s existing labs, know-how, research, fields, greenhouses, and oversight to develop a Seed Trait
for corn is significant as it allows Genvor to bring seed traits to market with substantially less capital investment. For its
CRADA in corn, Genvor’s contribution was under $700,000, primarily for a dedicated scientist to work onsite at the USDA facility
over the years. Genvor is expecting to continue R&D of its anti-microbial and nutritional enhancement peptides (“NEPs”)
for poultry and swine feed through additional CRADAs with the USDA. In addition, Genvor is planning to apply for a CRADA for Aflatoxins
in peanuts. The USDA partnership is based upon the confidence and proof of concept found in Genvor’s solutions.
Below is a chart showing the average surveyed
development costs of bring a new plant trait to market in the United States:
Business Strategy: Licensing First
and Leveraging R&D with Third Parties
Genvor’s business model is to remain
capital-light, focused on leveraging its third-party research and development through its initial CRADA with the USDA, and any
subsequent CRADAs that may be granted, while also adopting a licensing approach to reduce “cash burn” or the need for
significant manufacturing and marketing overhead. Genvor is highly scalable and capital efficient with minimal overhead relative
to peers, allowing the Company to focus on core research and development competency. Genvor does not expect revenue until the end
of 2025, through the licensing and distribution of either or both the topical spray and seed trait, utilizing licensing and royalty
opportunities.

Financing Needs and Infrastructure Planning
Genvor is actively evaluating various financing
options to support its near- and mid-term operational and strategic objectives. The Company anticipates that additional capital
will be required to fund general corporate overhead, research and development (R&D) activities, peptide production for testing
and validation, contributions under its Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA), and associated regulatory and commercialization efforts.
While Genvor has primarily leveraged external
research infrastructure through collaborations and government partnerships to date, the Company is assessing the potential establishment
of a dedicated laboratory facility in or near Sacramento, California, to support internal R&D and pilot-scale development.
Additional lab sites, greenhouses, or field trial locations may be established in the future, either independently or in collaboration
with commercial agricultural input partners, as the Company scales its development and testing efforts.
At present, there are no definitive plans
to construct or acquire independent laboratory or greenhouse infrastructure. Genvor continues to rely on existing resources available
through its strategic partnerships, including access to scientific, regulatory, and field-testing capabilities through the USDA
CRADA and affiliated research partners. However, the Company may pursue additional financing in the future if internal infrastructure
development or self-funded research programs are deemed beneficial to accelerate commercialization or expand the scope of its technology
platform.

or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services,
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Employees
As of September 30, 2024, we had one full-time
employee.
Property
The Company does not own or rent property.
The Company’s office space is virtual and provided by an officer at no charge.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
As a smaller reporting company, we are
not required to provide the information required by this item.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
At this time, the Company does not have
formal processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our approach to cybersecurity
is currently informal and primarily reactive, involving basic security measures such as:
●Basic Security Software: We use standard antivirus and anti-malware software for protection against
common threats.
●Password Policies: Simple password policies are in place to protect access to our systems.
However, we recognize the importance of
cybersecurity and are in the process of developing more robust strategies. We plan to:
●Develop a Cybersecurity Framework: Establish a formal risk assessment process to identify vulnerabilities.
●Engage Cybersecurity Expertise: Consider hiring or consulting with cybersecurity professionals
to guide our strategy.
We acknowledge that the absence of comprehensive
cybersecurity processes could potentially expose the company to risks, which might materially affect our operations, financial
condition, or strategic decisions in the future. We are committed to improving our cybersecurity posture as our resources allow.
Governance
●Board Oversight: Currently, our directors do not have a formal structure for overseeing cybersecurity
risks. We plan to review this oversight in the near future to ensure appropriate governance is established.
●Management’s Role: Day-to-day management of cybersecurity is handled by our Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”), who does not have specialized training in cybersecurity. We are considering enhancing this role or
outsourcing to professionals with specific cybersecurity expertise.
●Expertise: Our current management and Board do not have in-depth cybersecurity expertise. We are
considering educational opportunities or consulting to address this gap.
Material Effect from Cybersecurity Threats
To date, no known cybersecurity incidents
have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, due to our limited cybersecurity
measures, we acknowledge that our company could be at higher risk of material impact from cybersecurity threats. We are actively
working to mitigate these risks.
Item 2. Properties
We do not own any real estate or other
properties.

Penny Stock
Our common stock is considered “penny
stock” under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC has adopted
rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity
securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted
on the NASDAQ Stock Market System, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities
is provided by the exchange or quotation system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that:
●
contains a description of the nature and level of risks in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;
●
contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities’ laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;
●
contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;
●
defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and
●
contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation.
The broker-dealer also must provide, prior
to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with:
●
bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;
●
the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;
●
the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the marker for such stock; and
●
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.
In addition, the penny stock rules that
require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special
written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written
acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and
a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement.
These disclosure requirements may have
the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock.

Related Stockholder Matters
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
On September 9, 2024, the Company and Chris
Peterman entered into a convertible promissory note agreement, providing for the issuance of a note in the principal amount of
$20,000. In addition, the Company issued Chris Peterman a stock purchase warrant to acquire 40,000 shares of common stock of the
Company at a per share price of $0.01. In accordance with ASC 470-20-25-2, proceeds from the sale of a debt instrument with stock
purchase warrants are allocated to the two elements based on the relative fair values of the debt instrument without the warrants
and of the warrants themselves at time of issuance. The portion of the proceeds so allocated to the warrants are accounted for
as additional paid-in capital. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the debt instrument portion of the transaction. The
fair value of the warrants issued to the investor was $40,000. Therefore, the Company recorded debt discount of $13,333 related
to the warrants issued to the investor, which will be amortized over the term of the note.
The
forgoing securities were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder, as there was no general solicitation, and the transactions did not
involve a public offering.

Overview
Genvor Incorporated (the “Company”
or “Genvor”) was incorporated in Florida on September 26, 2018, as Allure Worldwide, Inc., and as of November 18, 2019,
redomiciled to Nevada. On June 24, 2022, the Company changed its name to from Allure Worldwide, Inc. to Genvor Incorporated.
The Company’s subsidiary, Genvor
Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 4, 2019, as Nexion Biosciences Inc. and on January 22, 2020,
its name was changed to Genvor Inc. Genvor Inc. develops plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global
food security.
During May 2019, Genvor Inc. acquired Nexion
Biosciences LLC (“NBLLC”) from a founder for nominal consideration. NBLLC was formed in the State of Delaware on December
28, 2018.
The Company was originally formed with
the intention of seeking to acquire the assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in
exchange for its securities. On January 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
with Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old Genvor”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) Old Genvor. On March
2, 2022, the Company and Old Genvor entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to consummate the Acquisition,
and pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Genvor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, would merge (the
“Merger”) with and into Old Genvor, with each share of Old Genvor common stock issued immediately prior to the time
of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the Company.
On May 27, 2022, the Acquisition closed,
Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Old Genvor, each share of Old Genvor was exchanged for the right to receive one share of
Company common stock, 35,261,871 shares of Company common stock were issued to Old Genvor’s pre-merger shareholders (the
“Merger Shares”), constituting a change of control of the Company, and Old Genvor became a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company had 55,261,871 issued and outstanding common shares upon the closing
of the share exchange with Old Genvor, and subsequently the Company’s original founding shareholders cancelled 18,144,112
shares of Company common stock in connection with the Acquisition.
As a result of the Acquisition, the Company’s
business plan is that Old Genvor will be continuing its research and development addressing plant-based defense technology ich
then can be commercialized to help farmers and growers globally to overcome potentially catastrophic losses resulting from plant
disease, toxins, bacteria, and fungi that destroy their crops. These solutions can result in greater crop yields and economic savings,
which can assist in overcoming world-wide food scarcity.
The Company’s technology was developed
by two university scientists, Dr. Clayton Yates, and Dr. Jesse Jaynes, who shared a mission to develop crop protection technology
designed to defend against crop diseases affecting both animals and humans alike.
Recent Activity
The Company actively participated in prominent
biotechnology conferences and significant industry events. Moreover, productive engagements with USDA partners have enhanced our
ongoing multi-year studies on seed traits in corn, focusing on combatting a wide array of pathogens, including aflatoxin.
Our outreach efforts extended to major
agricultural enterprises, facilitating discussions on potential partnership opportunities to bring Genvor’s peptide portfolio
to market. Multiple product formats are currently under evaluation and development, with our steadfast commitment to the license-first
business model. The company is collaborating with several contract manufacturing firms to develop efficient and cost-effective
manufacturing systems. This initiative aims to meet the manufacturing requirements of commercial partnerships and ensure the ability
to offer economically viable pricing that aligns with market expectations in the global agricultural sector.
Exploration of international animal health
research collaborations is underway, including discussions with a leading animal health research company. Concurrently, we are
intensifying efforts in non-GMO product development and expediting the innovation of novel peptides.
In August 2024
Genvor was awarded the Golden Ticket by Bayer.
17
Strategic Collaboration
with Bayer: Golden Ticket Award
In 2024, Genvor
was selected by Bayer AG as the inaugural recipient of its Golden Ticket award, a competitive innovation initiative designed to
support high-impact agricultural technologies. This award grants Genvor fully funded access to laboratory space, equipment, and
expert mentorship at Bayer’s LifeHub California @AgStart, a leading AgriFoodTech innovation center.
This collaboration
enables Genvor to accelerate development and commercialization of its proprietary peptide-based crop protection and trait technologies.
Genvor’s platform leverages antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to enhance disease resistance and crop performance through both
biological sprays and genetic trait innovation.
Bayer’s selection of Genvor from
a global pool of applicants underscores the scientific and commercial potential of our approach. The Golden Ticket program aligns
with Bayer’s broader commitment to regenerative agriculture and cutting-edge crop protection solutions, providing critical
resources to advance Genvor’s mission of sustainable innovation in global agriculture.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Several conditions and events
cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company requires capital for its contemplated
operational and marketing activities to take place. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had
working capital deficit of approximately $1,728,000 at September 30, 2024 and had incurred recurring net losses and generated
negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately $2,885,000 and $976,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, respectively.
The Company’s
ability to raise additional capital through debt or future issuances of capital stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional
financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to
the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve
these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Use
of Estimates
The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.
It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed
at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term
due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Significant estimates
during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances,
and the valuation of stock-based compensation.
18
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for pursuant
to ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s
financial statements or tax returns. The charge for taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are
non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In
principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates
that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited
in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred
tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based awards, including stock warrants and stock grants, based
on estimated grant-date fair values. The Company measures employee and nonemployee awards at the date of grant, which generally
is the date at which the Company and the nonemployee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based
payment award.
The Company uses the straight-line attribution
method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the requisite service period during which the employee or nonemployee
is required to provide services in exchange for the award. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of awards as
they occur, with previously recognized compensation reversed in the period that the awards are forfeited.

●For the year ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased by $157,763,
or 191.2%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased research projects in the
year ended September 30, 2024. We expect that our research and development expenses will likely remain at its current level with
minimal increase in the near future.
●For the year ended September 30, 2024, advertising and marketing
expenses increased by $84,183, or 100.0%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased
advertising activities in the year ended September 30, 2024. We expect that our advertising and marketing expenses will likely
remain at its current level with minimal increase in the near future.
●Professional
fees primarily consisted of accounting fees, audit fees, legal service fees, consulting fees,
investor relations service charges, and other fees. For the year ended September 30, 2024,
professional fees increased by $399,445 or 59.4% as compared to the year ended September
30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to an increase in investor relations service chargers
of approximately $166,000 resulting from the increased investor relations services to enhance
the visibility of our company, an increase in accounting fees of approximately $127,000 mainly
due to the increase in stock-based compensation of $100,000 which reflected the value of
warrants granted and vested in the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase in recruiting
service fees of $90,000, and an increase in other miscellaneous items of approximately $17,000.
We expect that our professional fees will remain at their current level with minimal increases
in the near future.
●For the year ended September 30, 2024, compensation and related benefits increased by $545,430,
or 70.7%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The significant increase was primarily attributable to an increase
in stock-based compensation of $350,000 which reflected the value of warrants and common stock granted and vested to our management
in the year ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in cash compensation of approximately $195,000 due to the increased personnel.
We expect that our compensation and related benefits will continue to increase in the near future since we amended our chief executive
officer’s employment agreement in December 2024.
●Other general and administrative expenses mainly consisted
of OTC listing fee, office supplies, travel and entertainment expenses, and other miscellaneous items. For the year ended September
30, 2024, other general and administrative expenses increased by $157,540, or 179.6%, as compared to the year ended September 30,
2023. The increase was mainly due to increased travel and other business activities.
Loss from Operations
As a result of the foregoing,
for the year ended September 30, 2024, loss from operations amounted to $2,783,047, as compared to $1,438,686 for the year ended
September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $1,344,361, or 93.4%.
Other Expense
Other expense mainly includes interest expense, loss
on debt settlement, default penalties – late fees on a note payable, and other miscellaneous expense.
Other expense, net, totaled $101,911 for the
year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $268,795 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $166,884, or 62.1%,
which was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense of approximately $26,000, mainly driven by the decrease in outstanding
note payable, a decrease in loss on debt settlement of approximately $111,000, and a decrease in default penalties – late fees
of $30,000.
20
Income Taxes
We did not have
any income taxes expense for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 since we incurred losses in these periods.
Net Loss
As
a result of the factors described above, our net loss was $2,884,958, or $0.15 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended
September 30, 2024, as compared to $1,707,481, or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of $1,177,477, or 69.0%.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
We
have a limited operating history and our continued growth is dependent upon obtaining additional financing to fund future obligations
and pay liabilities arising from ordinary course business operations. In addition, the current cash balance cannot be projected to cover
our operating expenses for the next twelve months from the release date of this report. These matters raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital,
implement our business plan, and generate sufficient revenues. There are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to generate
sufficient revenues, maintain sufficient cash balance or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern. We plan to raise
capital in the future through the sale of equity or debt to implement our business plan. However, there is no assurance these plans will
be realized and that any additional financings will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.
Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations as they come due and
otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a cash balance of $373 and $44,354, respectively.
The following table sets
forth a summary of changes in our working capital deficit from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024:

Our working capital deficit
increased by $7,302 to $1,728,032 at September 30, 2024 from $1,720,730 at September 30, 2023. The increase in working capital deficit
was primarily attributable to an increase in notes payable of approximately $78,000 which was mainly attributable to the late fees capitalized
into notes payable in the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase in accrued professional fees of approximately $245,000 which was
mainly attributable to the increase in professional services providers in the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase in accrued research
and development fees of approximately $195,000 due to the increased research projects in the year ended September 30, 2024, and an increase
in accrued payroll liability and compensation of approximately $238,000 which was primarily attributable to we hired a full time CEO in
January 2024 and his salary was accrued and unpaid commencing on May 1, 2024, offset by a decrease in convertible notes payable of approximately
$493,000 resulting from conversion of notes payable into our common stock and warrants in the year ended September 30, 2024, and a decrease
in accrued liabilities and other payables of approximately $236,000 driven by the payments made to our related parties in the year ended
September 30, 2024.

net loss of approximately $2,885,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of a decrease in accrued
liabilities and other payables of approximately $236,000 due to the payments made to our related parties in the year ended September 30,
2024, offset by an increase in accrued professional fees of approximately $245,000 resulting from the increase in professional services
providers in the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase in accrued research and development fees of approximately $195,000
driven by the increased research projects in the year ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in accrued payroll liability and compensation
of approximately $238,000 which was primarily attributable to we hired a full time CEO in January 2024 and his salary was accrued and
unpaid commencing May 1, 2024, and the non-cash item adjustments, primarily consisting of late fee
capitalized into notes payable of $90,000, and stock-based compensation and service expense of approximately $1,363,000 which was
mainly attributable to the value of warrants granted and vested in the year ended September 30, 2024 of approximately $1,007,000 and the
value of our common stock granted in the year ended September 30, 2024 of approximately $356,000.
Net
cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $864,557, which primarily reflected our consolidated
net loss of approximately $1,707,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of a decrease in accrued
payroll liability and compensation of approximately $166,000, and a decrease in USDA CRADA liability of approximately $246,000,
offset by an increase in accrued professional fees of approximately $139,000, and the non-cash item adjustments, primarily consisting
of loss on debt settlement of $105,000, and stock-based compensation and service expense of approximately $963,000.
Net cash flow provided by
financing activities was $931,660 for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $612,525 for the year ended September
30, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds from issuance of convertible debt and warrants of $20,000 and
proceeds from sale of common stock of approximately $912,000. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we received proceeds from notes
payable of $250,000 and proceeds from sale of common stock of approximately $363,000.
The following
trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term:
●
an increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business;
●
the use of capital for acquisitions and the development of business opportunities; and
●
the cost of being a public company.
In addition, the
impact that the imposition of tariffs and changes to global trade policies could have on our results of operations is uncertain.
Based upon our
current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months.
We intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures
or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding,
the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available
to us on acceptable terms or at all.
Inflation
The
effect of inflation on our operating results was not significant for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Genvor
Incorporated and Subsidiaries
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Genvor Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September
30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year
ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a net capital deficiency and has not yet
generated any revenues. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOTE
1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Company
Background
On
May 27, 2022, Genvor Incorporated, formerly known as Allure Worldwide, Inc. (the “Company” or “Genvor”
or “we”), a Nevada corporation, Genvor Acquisition, Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old Genvor”), completed their previously
announced merger transaction pursuant to which the Company acquired Old Genvor (the “Acquisition”), and Old Genvor
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Acquisition was completed pursuant to an Exchange Agreement, dated as of
January 11, 2021 (the “Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which Old Genvor was acquired by the Company as its wholly
owned subsidiary and each share of Old Genvor common stock was exchanged for a share of the Company’s common stock, and
a merger agreement, dated March 2, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into
Old Genvor, with Old Genvor continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the merger,
and each share of Old Genvor was converted into the right to receive a share of the Company (the “Merger”). After
closing of the Merger, the Company was renamed “Genvor Incorporated.”
For
accounting purposes, Old Genvor was the surviving entity. The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of Old Genvor,
pursuant to which Old Genvor was treated as the accounting acquirer, surviving and continuing entity although the Company was
the legal acquirer. The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with this transaction. Accordingly,
the Company’s historical financial statements are those of Old Genvor and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nexion Biosciences
LLC (“NBLLC”) immediately following the consummation of this reverse merger transaction.
During
May 2019, Old Genvor acquired NBLLC from a founder for nominal consideration as a wholly owned subsidiary. NBLLC was formed in
the state of Delaware on December 28, 2018. Currently, NBLLC is dormant.
Genvor
develops plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global food security.
Business
Plan and Strategy
Genvor’s
business strategy focuses on the continued research and development of plant-based defense technologies designed to address major
threats to global crop production, including plant diseases, toxins, bacteria, and fungi. These innovations aim to support farmers
and growers worldwide by reducing crop loss, improving yields, and enhancing economic outcomes, ultimately contributing to solutions
for global food security.
The
Company is advancing its portfolio of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) technologies by designing and validating minimum viable products
(MVPs) and expanding its collaborations to include foliar application models, seed traits, and seed treatment platforms. In parallel,
Genvor is leveraging its proprietary peptide library to address additional high-value market opportunities in crop protection—such
as insect control, biostimulants, and nutrient use efficiency—as well as adjacent applications in animal health and feed
efficiency.
Genvor’s
commercial model is centered around forming joint development agreements (JDAs) and strategic joint ventures targeted at specific
problems, crops, animal applications, or geographic markets. These partnerships are intended to accelerate product development
and commercialization while expanding market access.
Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission for financial information.
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Genvor Incorporated, Old Genvor and its wholly owned
subsidiary NBLLC. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,728,000
at September 30, 2024 and had incurred recurring net losses
and generated negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately $2,885,000
and $976,000
for the year ended September 30, 2024, respectively, with no
revenues earned, and limited operational history. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
While
the Company is currently developing its products and technologies, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough
to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of additional public and/or
private offerings of its stock. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan,
develop its products and technologies, and generate revenues should provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going
concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional
funds in the future, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate cash flows from financing activities or operating
activities.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification
of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these estimates
and assumptions may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Making estimates requires
management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition,
situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates.
Significant
estimates during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation
allowances, and the valuation of stock-based compensation.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at September
30, 2024 and 2023.
The
Company maintains its cash on deposits with bank and financial institution within the United States that at times may exceed federally-insured
limits of $250,000. The Company manages this credit risk by concentrating its cash balances in high quality financial institutions
and by periodically evaluating the credit quality of the primary financial institutions holding such deposits. The Company has
not experienced any losses in such bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. At
September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash balances were not in excess of the federally-insured limits.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
The
Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies
the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
●Level
1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
available at the measurement date.
●Level
2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not
active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from
or corroborated by observable market data.
●Level
3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions
on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
based on the best available information.
The
fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair
Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
primarily due to their short-term nature.
ASC
825-10 “Financial Instruments”, allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable,
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that
instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value
option to any outstanding instruments.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are
capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and
any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the period of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases
in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.
Impairment
of Long-lived Assets
In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an
impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. During the years
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any impairment charges on its long-lived assets.
Research
and Development
Expenditures
for research and product development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred research and development expense of
$240,263 and $82,500 in the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Advertising
and Marketing Costs
All
costs related to advertising and marketing are expensed as incurred. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advertising
and marketing costs amounted to $84,183 and $0, respectively.
Commitments
and Contingencies
In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its
business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for such contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.

Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based awards, including
stock warrants and stock grants, based on estimated grant-date fair values. The Company measures employee and nonemployee awards
at the date of grant, which generally is the date at which the Company and the nonemployee reach a mutual understanding of the
key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award.
The
Company uses the straight-line attribution method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the requisite service
period during which the employee or nonemployee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. The Company has elected
to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur, with previously recognized compensation reversed in the period that the awards
are forfeited.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset/liability method prescribed by ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence,
it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”.
Using that guidance, the benefit for tax positions taken can only be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had no significant uncertain tax positions which would require either recognition of a liability or disclosure in the financial
statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to significant uncertain income tax positions in income tax
expense. However, no such interest and penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Per
Share Data
ASC
Topic 260 “Earnings per Share,” requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”)
with a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
then shared in the earnings of the entity.
Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period.
For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon
the conversion of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes (using the if-converted method) and exercise of common stock
warrants (using the treasury stock method). Common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per
share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. In a period in which the Company has a net loss, all potentially dilutive securities
are excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact.
The
following table summarizes the securities that were excluded from the diluted per share calculation because the effect of including
these potential shares was antidilutive:

Segment
Reporting
The
segment reporting structure uses the Company’s management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company
manages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by products. During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the
Company is organized into one strategic business unit. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which
separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
in deciding how to make operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) is its CODM.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation, including breakouts within current liabilities, breakouts within operating expenses,
and breakouts within the statement of cash flows. These reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
Recent
Accounting Standards
In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reportable segment
disclosure requirements, including significant segment expenses and interim disclosures (“Topic 280”). The guidance
allows for disclosure of multiple measures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss, and it requires that public entities
with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by the ASU and all existing disclosures in Topic 280. ASC 2023-07
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim reporting periods starting after December 15,
2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the new standard effective June 30, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The
adoption of this ASU affects only the Company’s disclosures, with no impacts to its financial condition or results of operations.
In
December 2023, the FASB ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This guidance is intended
to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor
requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to disclosure regarding rate reconciliation and income
taxes paid both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2024 on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects
that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements
that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows or disclosures.

These notes are past due and amounts owed are in dispute at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. On May 15, 2025, the Company and
Brent Lilienthal entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which, the Company settled $217,000 debt owed by issuance of
120,000 shares of common stock of the Company (see Note 8).
(**)
These notes were converted into shares of common stock or stock warrants of the Company in the year ended September 30, 2024 as
described below.
(***)
On September 9, 2024, the Company and Chris Peterman entered
into a convertible promissory note agreement, providing for the issuance of a note in the principal amount of $20,000. The note is
due on September 9, 2025. Principal amount is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.00
per share. In addition, the Company issued Chris Peterman a stock purchase warrant to acquire 40,000 shares of common stock of the
Company at a per share price of $0.01 (“Pre-Funded Warrants”). The Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable at September
9, 2025 and until the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full.. In accordance with ASC 470-20-25-2, proceeds from the sale of
a debt instrument with stock purchase warrants are allocated to the two elements based on the relative fair values of the debt instrument
without the warrants and of the warrants themselves at time of issuance. The portion of the proceeds so allocated to the warrants are
accounted for as additional paid-in capital. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the debt instrument portion of the transaction.
The fair value of the warrants issued to the investor was $40,000. Therefore, the Company recorded debt discount of $13,333 related
to the warrants issued to the investor, which will be amortized over the term of the note. For the year ended September 30, 2024, amortization
of debt discount related to the note payable amounted to $741, which have been included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
Mel
Wentz receives a default penalty of $10,000
each month and the note goes unpaid. The Company is currently
disputing amount claimed by Mel Wentz under state usury laws (see Note 7). On July 14, 2025, the Company received a letter from a third
party legal counsel which states the loan agreement appears to be invalid under Texas usury laws. Therefore, commencing on July 1, 2024,
the monthly penalty of $10,000
is not accrued any more.
On

NOTE
5 – INCOME TAXES
As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $3,911,000
and $2,497,000,
respectively, which may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income through 2044. The Company’s net operating loss
carry forwards may be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses because of an ownership
change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The
Company’s tax expense differs from the “expected” tax expense for federal income tax purposes (computed by applying
the United States federal tax rate of 21% to loss before taxes for fiscal year 2024 and 2023), as follows:

5 – INCOME TAXES (continued)
The
tax effects of the temporary differences between reportable financial statement income and taxable income are recognized as deferred
tax assets and liabilities.
The
Company is open for audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and U.S. state tax jurisdictions from tax year 2021 to tax year
2024,
The
tax effect of significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and 2023,

$—
$—
In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment.
Because
of the historical earnings history of the Company, the net deferred tax assets for 2024 and 2023 were fully offset by a 100% valuation
allowance. The valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax assets was $3,020,766
and $2,687,054
as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements
with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
We have had no disagreements with our accountants
required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, who is the same person, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the year ended September 30, 2024. Based
upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period,
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act.
Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
●Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
●Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the Company; and
●Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls, and internal controls will prevent
all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2024, based upon the framework in Internal Control –Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses
at September 30, 2024:
●Lack of oversight by independent directors in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures;
●Lack of functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and
monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
●Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial
transaction processing and reporting and to allow for proper monitoring controls over accounting;
●Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period
end financial disclosure and reporting processes.
To remediate our internal control weaknesses,
management intends to implement the following measures:
●The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint an audit
committee.
23
●The Company will add sufficient knowledgeable accounting personnel to properly segregate duties
and to affect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.
●Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate
written accounting policies and procedures.
The additional hiring is contingent upon
the Company’s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt for its continued operational activities and corporate
expenses. Management provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.
We understand that remediation of material
weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls are a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations.
However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress
and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and adjust as and when necessary.
As a smaller reporting company, we are
not required to provide, and this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm
regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of
Controls
The Company’s management, including
the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further,
the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

There are no family relationships among
any of our directors and executive officers.
Our directors are elected at the annual
meeting of the shareholders, with vacancies filled by the Board of Directors, and they serve until their successors are elected
and qualified, or their earlier resignation or removal. Officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion
of the board of directors or until their earlier resignation or removal. Any action required can be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders of the corporation which may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if consent
of consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled
to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principle
place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings are
recorded.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
(“NRS”) provides that a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the director’s
or officer’s acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional
misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law. Section 78.7502 of NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers
against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or (ii) acted
in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director
was unlawful. Section 78.751 of NRS permits a Nevada company to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred
by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof,
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company. Section 78.751
of NRS further permits the company to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles
of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise. Section 78.752 of NRS provides that a Nevada company may purchase and maintain insurance
or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company,
or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to
indemnify him against such liability and expenses.
26
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that
no director or officer of the Company will be personally liable to the Company or any of its stockholders for damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability
of a director or officer (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or
(ii) the payment of dividends in violation of Section 78.300 of NRS. In addition, our Bylaws implement the indemnification and
insurance provisions permitted by Chapter 78 of the NRS by providing that the Company shall indemnify its directors to the fullest
extent permitted by the NRS and may, if and to the extent authorized by the board of directors, so indemnify its officers and any
other person whom it has the power to indemnify against liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever; and the Company
may at the discretion of the board of directors purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who holds or who has held
any position identified in the paragraph above against any and all liability incurred by such person in any such position or arising
out of his status as such.
Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to provisions
of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification
is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of
our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
of such issue.
Director Compensation
During the years ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we did not have an independent director. Directors that were employees were not paid any fees for their role as directors.
Involvement on Certain Material Legal
Proceedings During the Last Five Years
No director, officer, significant employee,
or consultant has been convicted in a criminal proceeding, exclusive of traffic violations.
No bankruptcy petitions have been filed
by or against any business or property of any director, officer, significant employee, or consultant of the Company nor has any
bankruptcy petition been filed against a partnership or business association where these persons were general partners or executive
officers.
No director, officer, significant employee,
or consultant has been permanently or temporarily enjoined, barred, suspended, or otherwise limited from involvement in any type
of business, securities, or banking activities.
No director, officer or significant employee
has been convicted of violating a federal or state securities or commodities law.
Directors’ and Officers’
Liability Insurance
The Company purchased directors’
and officers’ liability insurance, effective January 8, 2025, to insure our directors and officers against liability for
acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers.
Code of Ethics
We intend to adopt a code of ethics that
applies to our officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer,
but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size. We intend to adopt a written code of ethics in the near future.
Corporate Governance and Board Independence
Our Board of Directors consists of three
directors and has not established a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive
committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in
an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent.
27
Due to our lack of operations and size,
and since we are not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we are not subject to any listing requirements mandating
the establishment of any particular committees; all functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole
board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the
corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe
that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company’s development, and our board of directors
believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors.
We believe that our board of directors
is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert”
would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date.
Board Leadership Structure and the Board’s
Role in Risk Oversight.
The Board of Directors is led by a chairman.
The Board believes its current leadership structure best serves the objectives of the Board’s oversight of management, the
Board’s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of the Company’s shareholders, and the Company’s
overall governance. The Board periodically reviews the leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve the
Company and its shareholders.
28
Audit Committee and Financial Expert;
Committees
The Company does not have an audit committee.
We are not a “listed company” under SEC rules and are therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised of
independent directors.
The Company has no nominating or compensation
committees at this time. The entire Board participates in the nomination and audit oversight processes and considers executive
and director compensation. Given the size of the Company and its stage of development, the entire Board is involved in such decision-making
processes. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues
concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any
other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.
Compliance with Section 16(A) of the
Exchange Act
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
the Company’s directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10% or more of a class of securities registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC.
Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to furnish
