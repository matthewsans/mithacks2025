Cleaver is a manufacturer of a line of products for the logistics and cargo industry.  5Table of Contents COMPANY OBJECTIVE AND MISSION: The Company currently shares its location with a related company of the President of the Company. The Company owns 100% of subsidiaries, Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS, Sharx Inc. and Sharx DK ApS. Anton Nielsen Vojens owns and leases commercial real estate to Circle K Denmark A/S, formerly StatOil A/S a Danish company. The lease expires in 2026. Through this lease, the Company believes that the operations of ANV will continue to produce revenues. Sharx distributes and sells cargo security straps and tie-downs pursuant to the Distribution Agreement with the manufacturer Cleaver ApS. The Company continues its efforts to raise capital to support operations and growth, and is actively searching acquisitions or mergers with another company that would complement the Company and increase its earnings potential. COMPETITION: The Company’s subsidiary ANV revenues are currently derived from its lease revenues of its commercial real estate holding. With the global changes in the economies during the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s direct competition would be other vacant commercial real estate entities. The Company believes that there are no identifiable direct competitors. Sharx had no revenues for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.  The load restraint equipment market in the United States and Europe is dominated by large companies such as Dottie Down, USA Ratchet, LLC, Ratchet Straps, USA, Kinedyne, LLC, The Rachet Depot, Inc., The Forankra Group, and GTF Factors, Ltd, each of which have far greater capital and operational resources than us. Our products will directly compete in the load restraint markets dominated by these major competitors. In this market, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support. CUSTOMERS: The Company’s subsidiary ANV currently has one customer, Circle K Denmark A/S, formerly StatOil AS., Copenhagen Denmark. The Company’s subsidiary Sharx had zero retail customers for the year ending June 30, 2025 and zero for the year ending June 30, 2024. Sharx has had no sales of product due to the manufacturer’s inability to produce and deliver product to Sharx due to COVID. EMPLOYEES: As of June 30, 2025, the Company had a total of 2 employees.   6Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Specific to Our Company THE POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VENTURES DEPENDS UPON FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY. The potential profitability of commercial real estate properties is dependent upon many factors beyond our control. For instance, world prices and markets for rents and leases of commercial properties are unpredictable, and respond to changes in domestic, international, political, social, and economic environments. Additionally, due to worldwide economic uncertainty, the availability and cost of funds for maintenance, repair, expansion and other expenses have become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to project. These changes and events may materially affect our financial performance. These factors cannot be accurately predicted and the combination of these factors may result in our Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY ANV and Sharx DK ApS are Danish companies with operations only in Denmark. During the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, foreign revenues accounted for 100% of our total revenue. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with generating revenue in multiple countries, including:  ●increased time, effort and attention of our management to manage our foreign operations;    ●balance sheet fluctuations.    ●currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including impacts of transactions in various currencies and translation of various currencies into dollars for U.S. reporting and financial covenant compliance purposes;    ●language barriers and other difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;    ●longer customer payment cycles and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;    ●uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the protection of property;    ●imposition of or increases in currency exchange controls, including imposition of or increases in limitations on conversion of various currencies into U.S. dollars;    ●imposition of or increases in revenue, income or earnings taxes and withholding and other taxes;    ●imposition of or increases in investment or trade restrictions and other restrictions or requirements by non-U.S. Governments;    ●inability to definitively determine or satisfy legal requirements, inability to effectively enforce contract or legal rights and inability to obtain complete financial or other information under local legal, judicial, regulatory, disclosure and other systems; and    ●nationalization and other risks, which could result from a change in government or other political, social or economic instability.  7Table of Contents WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A CONCENTRATION OF CUSTOMERS ANV has only one customer. There is no guarantee that this customer will remain solvent, and or continue with the Company in the same manner as it is now. As such, if ANV were to lose this customer, 100% of ANV’s revenues would be lost representing a 100% decrease in the Company’s revenues. Sharx DK ApS (“Sharx”) had zero retail customers for the year ending June 30, 2025 and zero for the year ending June 30, 2024.   The manufacturer of the products that Sharx sells has had no product available for Sharx to sell due to COVID and supply chain interruption. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES In the future, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and to acquire additional businesses. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital. PROVISIONS OF OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE CORPORATE LAW MAY DETER A THIRD PARTY FROM ACQUIRING OUR COMPANY Provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws, authorize our Board of Directors to, among other things, issue preferred stock and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote, approval or action by our stockholders. Our Board could take actions that could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us and that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Our Board could take such actions even if our stockholders consider a change in control to be in their best interests. WE PLAN TO GROW OUR BUSINESS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN OUR INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS The acquisition of new businesses is costly, such new businesses may not enhance our financial condition, and we may face difficulties and be unsuccessful in integrating new businesses. The resources expended in identifying, negotiating and structuring acquisitions and joint ventures may be significant and may not result in any transactions. Any future acquisitions will be subject to a number of challenges in integrating new operations into our existing operations, including but not limited to:  ●diversion of management time and resources;    ●difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;    ●potential disruption of our ongoing business;    ●difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;    ●impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; and   ●potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  8Table of Contents Risks Specific to Our Industry WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE ANV, has only one commercial real estate property. There is no guarantee that the demand for rental of this property will continue and potentially this would affect the Company’s performance. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPETITION IN THE LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY Sharx is only selling one type of product and only to the logistics and transportation industry. There are larger competitors with less expensive products. Technologies in the logistics and transportation industry are advancing, and possibly eliminating the need for the Sharx products. There is no assurance that the demand for this product will continue in these industries. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPLY OF PRODUCT Sharx’s supply of products is derived from only one vendor and there can be no assurance that the vendor would continue to, or have the ability to, continue supply of product. Should the vendor discontinue supplying product, Sharx would lose 100% of its supply of product. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DELIVERY OF PRODUCT Sharx’s delivery of its products to its customers is via drop shipping from the manufacturer or third party to the customer. There can be no assurance that the manufacturer would continue to, or have the ability to, continue drop shipping Sharx’s products. Should the manufacturer discontinue drop shipping, there is no assurance that Sharx could obtain alternate delivery solutions and that alternate shipping solutions would be cost effective for the sales of Sharx’s products. Risks Related to Our Securities OUR COMMON STOCK IS SUBJECT TO THE “PENNY STOCK” RULES OF THE SEC AND THE TRADING MARKET IN OUR SECURITIES IS LIMITED, WHICH MAKES TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STOCK CUMBERSOME AND MAY REDUCE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: that a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks; and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Other Risk and Uncertainties: There are none.  9Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS There are none. ITEM 1C. Cyber Security At present the Company has minimal risk related to Cybersecurity as no operational business is conducted on the internet or available through the internet. Cybersecurity risk management will be an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management efforts once the Company has determined how and what security measures will need to be deployed. No enterprise risk can be eliminated entirely. We will seek to mitigate as much risk as possible and manage the remaining financial risk internally. Governance Our Board of Directors has primary responsibility for evaluating cybersecurity risk management, overseeing our major cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk, as well as oversight of compliance related to legal and regulatory exposure. The “to be newly formed” management positions responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks will be a Director of Cybersecurity and a Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who will report directly to our CFO. Presently our CFO is undertaking the actions of both the Director of Cybersecurity and CIO. The CIO will be responsible for ensuring that we have a cybersecurity risk management program in place that is fully aligned with business requirements and strategy. ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY The assets of the Company consist of its wholly owned subsidiary, Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS whose sole asset is commercial real estate in Vojens, Denmark.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION. The following discussion of our plan of operation, financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report.  11Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management’s view, most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates. The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary. Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (ANV and Sharx), after elimination of all intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits. Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are expressed in United States dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. Revenue Recognition: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company recognizes revenues under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 Leases (“ASC 842”) and ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) for our rental revenue and commission revenue.  Rental Revenue Rental revenue is derived from the Commercial Property lease in which quarterly payments are received pursuant to the property lease which is in effect until 2026. We recognize revenue when we have satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or delivering a service to a client. We measure revenue based upon the consideration set forth in an arrangement or contract with a client. We recognize revenue from these services when the services are completed. If we are paid in advance for these services, we record such payment as a contract liability until we complete the services. As of June 30, 2025, the Company recorded $3,281 of contract liabilities in connection to rental revenues. The Company leases land to a customer. We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. For our leases, we receive a fixed payment from the customer which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842.  12Table of Contents In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, “Leases.” The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration. We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement. We have not agreed to any deferral or abatement arrangements with any of our customers. The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements of ASC 842. A lease is short-term if, at the commencement date, it has a term of less than or equal to one year. Lease expense related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Commission revenue For our commission revenue, we recognize revenue under the five steps in Topic 606, which are as follows: 1) identify the contract with the customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. The Company’s source of commission revenue is from the Company’s subsidiary Sharx in which quarterly payments are received when the customer pre-pays or pays upon the date products are drop shipped from the manufacturer pursuant to a non-exclusive distribution agreement. At such time the products are drop shipped, the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue is recorded The Company has determined that it is an agent of the manufacturer and collects commission revenue at or before the delivery of product (See Note 3 for further details). Property and Equipment:  Land is recognized at cost. Land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Foreign Currency Translation: Foreign currency transactions are translated applying the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates. Stockholders’ equity accounts are translated at the appropriate historical rates and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates for the year. Foreign Currency Transactions: The Company applies the guidelines as set out in Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 830-20-35”) for foreign currency transactions. Pursuant to Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the exchange rate changes. Likewise, a transaction gain or loss (measured from the transaction date or the most recent intervening balance sheet date, whichever is later) realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the transaction is settled. The exceptions to this requirement for inclusion in net income of transaction gains and losses pertain to certain intercompany transactions and to transactions that are designated as, and effective as, economic hedges of net investments and foreign currency commitments. Pursuant to Section 830-20-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the following shall apply to all foreign currency transactions of an enterprise and its investees: (a) at the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction shall be measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity by use of the exchange rate in effect at that date as defined in section 830-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; and (b) at each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency or reporting currency of the recording entity shall be adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ANV uses the Danish Krone, DKK as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency. The wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency and from time to time has transactions in foreign currencies. The change in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting and functional currency and the foreign currency, the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally is included in determining net income (loss) for the period in which the exchange rate changes.  13Table of Contents Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required when it is less likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets. Because it is doubtful that the net operating losses of recent years will ever be used, a valuation allowance has been recognized equal to the tax benefit of net operating losses generated. Earnings per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024 there were 10,000 and 10,000, potential dilutive shares that need to be considered as common share equivalents and because of the net income for June 30, 2025 and 2024, the effect of these potential common shares is dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at June 30, 2025 did not exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such amounts. Stock-Based Compensation:  The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service period, which is generally the vesting period. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to major credit risk consist principally of a single subsidiary of Anton Nielsen Vojens ApS. ANV’s rent revenues are derived from one customer. The Company’s commission revenues are subject to concentration risk as the commission revenues are derived from one product. New Accounting Pronouncements already adopted: None.  14Table of Contents  New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF FISCAL YEAR 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2024 REVENUES. Revenues from operations were $43,445 in 2025 compared to $42,577 in 2024. The increase was attributable to the lease revenues. The following table summarizes the Company’s revenue allocations: Year ending June 30, 2025  2024 Subsidiary ANV Lease Revenues $43,445  $42,577 Subsidiary Sharx commissions from the sales of cargo security products  -   - Total $43,445  $42,577  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. G&A expenses were $6,656 in 2025 compared to $6,625 in 2024. The expenses are attributable to the Company’s SEC compliance and accounting costs. PROFESSIONAL EXPENSES. The professional expenses were attributable to the ordinary audit and review fees of $23,019 in 2025 compared to $21,500 in 2024.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). Other income (expense) was $353 in 2025 compared to $296 in 2024 and mainly attributable to interest on cash.

The decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily related to the repayment of debt and offset by an increase in taxes payable. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2025 and 2024 was $40,415 and $45,117 respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses paid on behalf of a related party.  15Table of Contents Net cash (used for) investing activities for 2025 and 2024 was $0 and $0 respectively.  Net cash (used for) financing activities for 2025 and 2024 was ($89,819) and ($52,989) respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded as of June 30, 2025 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as required in applicable SEC rules and the Company’s filed 10-K.    16Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-2013). Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2025. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2025, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with managements evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. ITEM 9B.

Wolfe  -   -   -   -   -   19Table of Contents  Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors was responsible for reviewing and approving the Company’s compensation policies and the compensation paid to executive officers. Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Donofrio, who comprise the Compensation Committee are employee and non-employee directors respectively. Compensation Philosophy The general philosophy of the Company’s compensation program, which has been reviewed and endorsed by the Committee, was to provide overall competitive compensation based on each executive’s individual performance and the Company’s overall performance. There are two basic components in the Company’s executive compensation program: (i) base salary and (ii) stock option awards. Base Salary Executive Officers’ salaries are targeted at the median range for rates paid by competitors in comparably sized companies. The Company recognizes the need to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated executives through a competitive base salary program, while at the same time considering the overall performance of the Company and returns to stockholders. Stock Option Awards With respect to executive officers, stock options are generally granted on an annual basis, usually at the commencement of the new fiscal year. Generally, stock options vest ratably over a four-year period and the executive must be employed by the Company in order to vest the options. The Compensation Committee believes that the stock option grants provide an incentive that focuses the executives’ attention on managing the Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the business. The option grants are issued at no less than 85% of the market price of the stock at the date of grant, hence there is incentive on the executive’s part to enhance the value of the stock through the overall performance of the Company. Compensation Pursuant to Plans The Company has three plans (the “Plans”) under which its directors, executive officers and employees may receive compensation. The principal features of the 1981 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “1981 Plan”), the 1988 Stock Option Plan (the “1988 Plan”), and the Non-Employee Director Plan (the “Director Plan”) are described below. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the Company terminated its tax qualified cash or deferred profit-sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”). During fiscal 2025, no executive officer received compensation pursuant to any of the Plans. The 1981 and 1988 Plans The purpose of the 1981 Plan and 1988 Plan (the “Option Plans”) is to provide an incentive to eligible directors, consultants and employees whose present and potential contributions to the Company are or will be important to the success of the Company by affording them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company and to enable the Company to enlist and retain in its employ the best available talent for the successful conduct of its business. The 1981 Plan The 1981 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in May 1981 and approved by the Company’s stockholders in March 1982. A total of 500,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1981 Plan. With the adoption of the 1988 Plan, no additional awards may be made under the 1981 Plan. As a result, the shares remaining under the 1981 Plan are now available solely under the 1988 Plan. Prior to its termination, the 1981 Plan provided for the grant of the following five types of awards to employees (including officers and directors) of the Company and any subsidiaries: (a) incentive stock rights, (b) incentive stock options, (c) non-statutory stock options, (d) stock appreciation rights, and (e) restricted stock. The 1981 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  20Table of Contents  The 1988 Plan The 1988 Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase Common Stock to employees (including officers) and consultants of the Company and any parent or subsidiary corporation. The aggregate number of shares which remained available for issuance under the 1981 plan as of the effective date of the 1988 Plan plus an additional 500,000 shares of Common Stock. Options granted under the 1988 Plan may either be immediately exercisable for the full number of shares purchasable thereunder or may become exercisable in cumulative increments over a period of months or years as determined by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price of options granted under the 1988 Plan may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant and the maximum period during which any option may be paid in cash, in shares if the Company’s Common Stock or through a broker-dealer same-day sale program involving a cash-less exercise of the option. One or more optionees may also be allowed to finance their option exercises through Company loans, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee. Issuable Shares As of September 20, 1995, approximately 374,000 shares of Common Stock had been issued upon the exercise of options granted under the Option Plans, no shares of Common Stock were subject to outstanding options under the Options Plans and 626,000 shares of Common Stock were available for issuance under future option grants. From July 1, 1991 to September 20, 1995, options were granted at exercise prices ranging from $1.22 to $8.15 per share. The exercise price of each option was equal to 85% of the closing bid price of Company’s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Over the Counter Bulletin Board Exchange. Due to employee terminations, all options became void in August 1995. As of September 30, 2001, 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock were available for issuance under future option grants and were still available at June 30, 2025. Board of Directors Compensation As of June 30, 2025, the directors did not receive any compensation for serving as members of the Board. In addition to any cash compensation, non-employee directors also are eligible to participate in the Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and to receive automatic option grants thereunder. The Director Plan provides for periodic automatic option grants to non-employee members of the Board. An individual who is first elected or appointed as a non-employee Board member receives an annual automatic grant of 25,000 shares plus the first annual grant of 5,000 shares, and will be eligible for subsequent 5,000 share grants at the second Annual Meeting following the date of his initial election or appointment as a non-employee Board member. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, no options were granted to non-employee Board members. ITEM 12.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES The Company’s auditors for the periods ending June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 were Sadler, Gibb &Associates, LLC, 344 W 13800 S, Suite 250, Draper, UT 84020. We have paid or expect to pay the following fees to Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC for work performed for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, attributable to the audits of consolidated financial statements: Year ending June 30, 2025  2024 Audit-Related Fees $23,460  $21,500 Tax and consulting Fees $-  $- Other fees $-  $-  The aggregate fees billed include amounts for interim reviews and the audit of the consolidated financial statements for 2025. In January 2003, the SEC released final rules to implement Title II of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2003. The rules address auditor independence and have modified the proxy fee disclosure requirements. Audit fees include fees for services that normally would be provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and that generally only the independent accountant can provide. In addition to fees for an audit or review in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, this category contains fees for comfort letters, statutory audits, consents, and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. Audit-related fees are assurance-related services that traditionally are performed by the independent accountant, such as employee benefit plan audits, due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, internal control reviews, attest services that are not required by statute or regulation, and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. The board has reviewed the fees paid to Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC and In-Revision. The board has also adopted policies and procedures to approve audit and non-audit services provided in the fiscal year 2025 by Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC and In-Revision. These policies and procedures involve annual pre-approval by the board of the types of services to be provided by our independent auditor and fee limits for each type of service on both a per-engagement and aggregate level. The board may additionally ratify certain de minimis services provided by the independent auditor without prior board approval, as permitted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules of the SEC promulgated thereunder.  23Table of Contents  PART IV ITEM 15: EXHIBITS AND REPORTS ON FORMS 8K, Reports filed on Form 8-K for the year ending June 30, 2025: None Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of the Document3.1 Certificate of Incorporation as Amended and filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware effective on December 5, 2014 (1)3.2 Bylaws21.1* Subsidiaries of Registrant31.1* Certification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a), as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.31.2* Certification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a), as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.32.1* Certification of Chief Executive Officer in accordance with 18 U.S.C.

(“the Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2025 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   Critical Audit MattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. /s/Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016. Draper, UTSeptember 11, 2025    F-2Table of Contents  ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS    As of June 30,   2025  2024 ASSETS      CURRENT ASSETS      Cash $57,225  $94,482 Property tax receivable  1,251   1,144 Total Current Assets  58,476   95,626          Property and equipment  634,601   579,588          TOTAL ASSETS $693,077  $675,214          LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY        CURRENT LIABILITIES        Accounts payable $2,200  $1,050 Contract liabilities  3,281   2,995 Taxes payable  88,979   73,830 Advances from a related party  55,974   128,373 Total Current Liabilities  150,434   206,248          Long Term Liabilities        Notes payable, net of current portion  127,029   127,029 Total Long-Term Liabilities  127,029   127,029          Total Liabilities  277,463   333,277          STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY-        Convertible preferred stock, Series 2, par value $0.01; authorized 10,000,000 shares; issued and outstanding 5,000 at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024  50   50          Convertible preferred stock, Series 3, par value $0.01; authorized 1,670,000 shares, zero shares issued and outstanding  -   -          Convertible preferred stock, Series 5; no par value,1 share authorized and zero shares issued and outstanding, respectively  -   -          Common stock, par value $0.01; at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, authorized 60,000,000 shares; issued and outstanding 3,292,945 and 3,292,945 shares, respectively  32,929   32,929          Additional paid-in capital  21,057,116   21,057,116          Accumulated other comprehensive income  78,152   8,613          Accumulated deficit  (20,752,633 )  (20,756,771 )         TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  415,614   341,937 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $693,077  $675,214  See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.  F-3Table of Contents  ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)   For the Years ended June 30,   2025  2024 Revenues      Rent Revenues $43,445  $42,577 Total Revenues  43,445   42,577          Operating Expenses        General and Administrative  6,656   6,625 Professional fees  23,019   21,500 Total Operating Expenses  29,675   28,125          Income from operations  13,770   14,451 Other Income (Expense)        Interest Income   353   296 Total Other Income (Expense)  353   296 Income before Income Taxes  14,123   14,748 Income Tax Expense  9,985   9,184          NET INCOME $4,138  $5,564          Weighted Average number of common shares outstanding        Basic  3,292,945   3,292,945 Diluted  3,302,945   3,302,945          Basic earnings per Share $0.00  $0.00 Dilutive earnings per Share $0.00  $0.00          OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)        NET INCOME $4,138  $5,564 Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments  69,539   (14,406 )TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) $73,677  $(8,842 ) See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.   F-4Table of Contents ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

From May of 1995 through December of 1997 the Company had minimal operations and was seeking funding for operations and companies to which it could merge or acquire. In March of 1998 the Company began operations again in California. From 1998 through 2000, the business produced and sold CD- ROMS for conference events, advertisement sales on the CD’s, database management and event marketing all associated with conference events. From 2000 through March of 2003, the business consisted solely of database management. From 2003 through April 2005, the business operations were derived totally from the Company’s wholly owned business, IP Service, ApS, a Danish IP security vulnerability company (“IP Service”). Since then, business operations have been solely derived from its wholly owned subsidiaries Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS (“ANV”), Sharx Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS (collectively “Sharx”). Lines of Business: Advanced Oxygen Technologies, Inc. operations are derived from its wholly owned subsidiaries Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS (“ANV”), Sharx Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS. ANV is a Danish company that owns commercial real estate in Vojens, Denmark. ANV’s revenues are derived solely from the lease revenue from its real estate. Circle K Denmark A/S, formerly StatOil A/S, leases the facility from ANV. The lease expires in 2026. Sharx Inc. is a Wyoming corporation incorporated in 2020 and operations are derived from its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS. Sharx DK ApS is a Danish company, incorporated in 2020. On June 30, 2020, Sharx DK ApS, entered into a Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement” Exhibit 10.1) with a third party vendor, Cleaver ApS, a Danish corporation (“Cleaver”), whereby Cleaver has appointed the Company as Cleaver’s nonexclusive distributor of its products in Europe, South America and North America. Cleaver is a manufacturer of a line of products for the logistics and cargo industry.  Sharx had no activity for the period ending June 30, 2025.   F-7Table of Contents NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (ANV and Sharx), after elimination of all intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits. Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are expressed in United States dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company recognizes revenues under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 Leases (“ASC 842”) and ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) for our rental revenue and commission revenue.  Rental Revenue Rental revenue is derived from the Commercial Property lease in which quarterly payments are received pursuant to the property lease which is in effect until 2026. We recognize revenue when we have satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or delivering a service to a client. We measure revenue based upon the consideration set forth in an arrangement or contract with a client. We recognize revenue from these services when the services are completed. If we are paid in advance for these services, we record such payment as a contract liability until we complete the services. As of June 30, 2025, the Company recorded $3,281 of contract liabilities in connection to rental revenues. The Company leases land to a customer. We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. For our leases, we receive a fixed payment from the customer which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842. In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, “Leases.” The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration. We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement. We have not agreed to any deferral or abatement arrangements with any of our customers. The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements of ASC 842. A lease is short-term if, at the commencement date, it has a term of less than or equal to one year. Lease expense related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Commission revenue For our commission revenue, we recognize revenue under the five steps in Topic 606, which are as follows: 1) identify the contract with the customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. The Company’s source of commission revenue is from the Company’s subsidiary Sharx in which quarterly payments are received when the customer pre-pays or pays upon the date products are drop shipped from the manufacturer pursuant to a non-exclusive distribution agreement. At such time the products are drop shipped, the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue is recorded The Company has determined that it is an agent of the manufacturer and collects commission revenue at or before the delivery of product (See Note 3 for further details).  F-8Table of Contents  Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at June 30, 2025 did not exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such amounts. Property and Equipment: Land is recognized at cost. Land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Foreign currency translation: Foreign currency transactions are translated applying the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates. Stockholders’ equity accounts are translated at the appropriate historical rates and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates for the year. Foreign currency transactions: The Company applies the guidelines as set out in Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 830-20-35”) for foreign currency transactions. Pursuant to Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the exchange rate changes. Likewise, a transaction gain or loss (measured from the transaction date or the most recent intervening balance sheet date, whichever is later) realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the transaction is settled. The exceptions to this requirement for inclusion in net income of transaction gains and losses pertain to certain intercompany transactions and to transactions that are designated as, and effective as, economic hedges of net investments and foreign currency commitments. Pursuant to Section 830-20-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the following shall apply to all foreign currency transactions of an enterprise and its investees: (a) at the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction shall be measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity by use of the exchange rate in effect at that date as defined in section 830-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; and (b) at each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency or reporting currency of the recording entity shall be adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ANV uses the Danish Krone, DKK as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency. The wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency and from time to time has transactions in foreign currencies. The change in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting and functional currency and the foreign currency, the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally is included in determining net income (loss) for the period in which the exchange rate changes.  F-9Table of Contents  Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required when it is less likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets. Because it is doubtful that the net operating losses of recent years will ever be used, a valuation allowance has been recognized equal to the tax benefit of net operating losses generated. Earnings per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024 there were10,000 and10,000, potential dilutive shares that need to be considered as common share equivalents and because of the net income for June 30, 2025, the effect of these potential common shares is dilutive. Stock-Based Compensation:  The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service period, which is generally the vesting period. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to major credit risk consist principally of a single subsidiary of Anton Nielsen Vojens ApS. ANV’s rent revenues are derived from one customer. The Company’s commission revenues are subject to concentration risk as the commission revenues are derived from one product. New Accounting Pronouncements already adopted: None. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.  F-10Table of Contents NOTE 3 - REVENUE: The Company’s subsidiary, Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS has one customer who is a non-related party and leases property from the Company.
