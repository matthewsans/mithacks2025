State
below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-F, 10-Q, N-SAR, N-CSR, or the transition report portion thereof, could
not be filed within the prescribed time period.
The
compilation, dissemination and review of the information required to be presented in the Form 10-K for the relevant fiscal year has imposed
time constraints that have rendered timely filing of the Form 10-K impracticable without undue hardship and expense to the registrant.
The registrant undertakes the responsibility to file such annual report no later than 15 days after its original due date.

On

Dimensions Inc. (“AD”) that, in conjunction with its exit from providing audit services to publicly traded companies, AD
had made the decision to resign as the Company’s PCAOB accountant effective May 2, 2025.

the
Company’s independent registered PCAOB accounting firm for the financial reporting period ending March 31, 2025, subject to completion
of Kreston’s standard client acceptance procedures.
As
a result of these two events ZRCN Inc. will be delinquent in filing its financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ending March 31,
