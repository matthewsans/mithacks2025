﻿
These figures represent the Company’s preliminary estimates of certain financial results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, based on currently available information. The Company has not yet finalized its consolidated financial statement results for this period. The Company’s actual results remain subject to the completion of its year-end closing process, which includes final review by management and the Company’s board of directors, including the Company's audit committee of the board of directors. While carrying out such procedures, the Company may identify items that require it to make adjustments to the preliminary estimates of its results set forth herein. As a result, the Company’s actual results could be different from those set forth herein and the differences could be material.
﻿
The preliminary estimates of the Company’s results included herein have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, P.C., has not audited, reviewed or compiled such preliminary estimates of the Company’s results. Accordingly, BDO USA, P.C. expresses no opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
