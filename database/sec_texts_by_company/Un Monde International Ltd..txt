PART I
Item 1.
Business
(a) Business Development
Un Monde International Ltd. (the “Company”)
was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2007, as Asiarim Corp. The Company was a development stage company with
the goal of acquire private corporations that are involved in education and management services offering private, distinguished, specialized,
and internationalized education to international students in schools.
Prior to 2012, the Company engaged in the computer
electronics business as it completed the acquisition of Commodore.
The former business operations of Asiarim Corp.
and its subsidiaries were abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced
in 2016. The Company filed its last 10-Q in 2011, this financial report included liabilities and debts. As of the date of this filing,
these liabilities and debts have been addressed and the legal opinion for debt write off.
On May 5, 2016, the Eighth District Court of Clark
County, Nevada granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and
the revocation of the Company’s charter. The order appointed Bryan Glass (“Mr. Glass”, the “Custodian”)
custodian with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize
new classes of stock.
The court awarded custodianship to Mr. Glass based
on the absence of a functioning board of directors, revocation of the company’s charter, and abandonment of the business. At this
time, Ms. Glass was appointed sole officer and director.
The Company was severely delinquent in filing
annual reports for the Company’s charter. The last annual report was filed on September 30, 2010 in on Form 10-K. In addition, the
company was subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements including filing 10-Q’s and 10-Ks. The Company filed its last 10-Q for
quarter ending June 30, 2011, and was out of compliance with Exchange Act reporting. Mr. Glass attempted to contact the Company’s
officers and directors through letters, emails, and phone calls, with no success.
Mr. Glass was a shareholder in the Company and
applied to the Court for an Order appointing Brian Glass as the Custodian. This application was for the purpose of reinstating the Company’s
corporate charter to do business and restoring value to the Company for the benefit of the stockholders.
Mr. Glass performed the following actions in its
capacity as custodian:
·
Funded any expenses of the company including paying off outstanding liabilities
·
Brought the Company back into compliance with the Nevada Secretary of State, resident agent, transfer agent
·
Appointed officers and directors and held a shareholders meeting
The Custodian paid the following expenses on behalf
of the company:
·
Nevada Secretary of State for reinstatement of the Company, $3,925
·
Transfer agent, Island Stock Transfer, $9,100
·
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation for the Company, $175

(b) Business of Issuer
Un Monde International Ltd. formerly Asiarim Corp.
(the “Company”) is a developmental stage company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2007. Our
plan of business has not been implemented but will incorporate the acquisition of private corporations involved in education and management
services offering private, distinguished, specialized, and internationalized education to international students in schools.
The Company changed its name in Nevada, the state
of domicile, to Un Monde International Ltd. At present financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital
in order to fund the acquisitions. All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented
as of this filing.
The Company is moving in a new direction, statements
made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have no history of performance and have not implemented our business
plan. Current management does not have any experience in acquisition of international educational companies but is actively looking for
a suitable person to incorporate into the management team.
We feel that our contemplated business plan addresses
the need for additional development in the education industry.
Our contemplated business is within the industry
of educating international students, so they have the tools to contribute and thrive in an interdependent world. Our vision incorporates
the spirit of social responsibility, not only on a local community basis but also on a global scale. We will achieve this through multilingual
education and critical thinking so the student may integrate into any cultural situation.
The impact of social distancing requirements due
to Covid-19 has accelerated already robust global growth in online education, a trend many expect to continue even after Covid-19 restrictions
are lifted.
As governments in China attempt to reduce the
cost of studying abroad, providing such opportunities in a cost-effective way has become the focus for leading educational institutions.
In a post-Covid world, online education is far and away now the ideal solution.
International education is generally taken to include:
·
Traditional curriculum (math, sciences, languages)
·
Knowledge of other world regions & cultures;
·
Familiarity with international and global issues;
·
Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
·
Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
·
Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.
The Company intends to implement its business plan upon raising capital.
Subject to available capital, the Company intends to invest in:
Development
·
Formal and informal education curriculum
·
Training, exchange programs, cross-cultural communication
2
Implementation
·
Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding
·
Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship
·
Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference
·
Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the
supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts
to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
·
Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology;
·
Competitive position as compared to other schools of similar size and experience within the education segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
·
Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items;
·
Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
·
The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and
·
Other relevant factors
In applying the foregoing criteria, management
will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available
data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity
to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities
for identifying and completing our business plan.
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever,
identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts
of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial
community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise
compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
There is no geographic limitation to the location
of targets, as these types of opportunities are not necessarily bound by geography; provided however, we expressly disclaim any intent
to and we will not pursue a business combination with a target company (either directly or through any subsidiaries) with any operations
in China, Hong Kong or Macau nor will we consummate a business combination with any such entity ever.
We expect that our due diligence will encompass,
among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well
as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either
by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash
payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.
We may incur time and costs required to select
and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty.
Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective international education program that is not ultimately
completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s
fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
We anticipate that the investigation of specific
business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments
will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs
may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation
in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs
incurred.
3
Competition
Our company expects to compete with many countries
in the international education industry. In addition, there are several competitors that are larger and more profitable than ARMC. We
expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally,
increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory
and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in an already established
industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings on new platforms are factors that mitigate the risk associated
with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result
in new students entering the international education marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our future operations
and results.
Compliance with education standards and guidelines
will increase development costs and the cost of operating our business. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point
for our education curriculum dictated by the market and our competitors.
Again, these are forward looking statements and
not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and have no merger candidates.
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
We are subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, we will be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and current reports on Form 8-K. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct
of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also (1) requires steps be taken to enhance the direct responsibility
of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; (2) establishes
clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; (3) creates
guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors;
(4) prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and (5) establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among
other provisions.
We will also be subject to Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act, which requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the
rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at
a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information
outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A. Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days
prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.
Employees
The Company currently has one officer, one director and
no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to execute our business plan.
In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment
agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to
time on an as-needed basis.
Item 1A.

Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity
and Risk Management
The Company currently manages its cybersecurity risk
through a variety of practices applicable to all users of its information technology and assets, including officers, directors, contractors,
and vendors. These practices include the use of password protocols, third-party firewalls, antivirus protections, and secure cloud-based
data storage. The Company also promotes general security awareness through basic user access controls and regular internal monitoring.
The Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risks
and performs an annual review of the Company’s cybersecurity program, including management’s actions to identify, detect,
and respond to potential threats.
As of the date of this report, the Company has not
experienced any material cybersecurity incidents, nor has it identified any material cybersecurity threats that have affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect

Business Overview
Un Monde International Ltd. is a developmental
stage company that focus on offering education and management services to private, distinguished, specialized, and internationalized education
to international students in schools. We are tentatively looking for capital or different target companies in same industry for acquisition
for our business plan.
Going Concern
Our auditor has indicated in their reports on
our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise additional capital
to fund operations. A “going concern” opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt
or equity securities.
Recent Developments
The Company ceased being a shell company as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which defines a shell company as a company that has:
(A)
no or nominal operations; and,
(B)
either,
a.
no or nominal assets;
b.
assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or,
c.
assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.
The determination was made based on the following:
1)
The Company has begun business operations in the second quarter of 2023 pursuant to its business plan. As such, the Company does not have nominal operations.
2)
On May 1, 2023, the Company has entered into a Commercial Lease Agreement for which the Company will use the leased property as its private education operation headquarter office space. The Company has made a total payment of CA$12,327.48 (US$9,328.05) to the landlord pursuant to the lease agreement.
Accordingly, pursuant to the status above, the
Company is a development stage company that has engaged in activities that are, at a minimum, sufficient to manifest a strong commitment
in pursuing a legitimate business as set forth in the Company’s business plan. Based on the business conducted by the Company since
May 2023, the Company believes it ceased being a shell company and has remained a non-shell company since then based on the most recent
quarterly filings.
Results of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended December 31,
2024 and 2023
Revenue
We had no revenues from operations during either
2024 or 2023.
General and Administrative Expense
General and Administrative Expenses were $92,243
for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $68,987 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $23,256. The Company incurred

Net Loss
We had a net loss of $92,243 for the year ended
December 31, 2024, compared to $68,987 for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had $0 of cash, liabilities
of $384,194, and an accumulated deficit of $2,587,661.
Net cash used in operating activities were $74,876
and $92,240 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Net cash provided by financing activities were
$74,876 and $92,240 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company received advances from related parties as
working capital the amounts.
The financial statements accompanying this Report
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of our business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have not yet generated any revenue, had
a net loss of $92,243 and have an accumulated loss of $2,587,661 as of December 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional
funds and implement our business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable
to continue as a going concern.

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
8
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in
SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based
on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting was not effective
as of December 31, 2024.
The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that the Company’s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company’s board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period
end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and communicated the matters to our
management.
Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company’s financial results. However, management believes
that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company’s board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the
Company’s determination to its financial statements for the future years.
We are committed to improving our financial organization.
As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel
resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one
or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully
functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial
reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.
Management believes that the appointment of one
or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit
committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company’s Board. In addition, management believes that preparing
and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies
and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements;
and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of
additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and
balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn
over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control
and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking
further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act that occurred during the small business issuer’s last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking
further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Director Independence
Our board of directors is currently composed of
two members, who do not qualify as independent directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market.
The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least
three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business
dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationship
exists which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made
these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard
to each director’s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.
11
Involvement in Legal Proceedings
To our knowledge, there have been no material
legal proceedings during the last ten years that would require disclosure under the federal securities laws that are material to an evaluation
of the ability or integrity of any of our directors or executive officers.
Potential Conflicts of Interest
We are not aware of any current or potential conflicts
of interest with our directors or executive officers, other business interests and their involvement with the Company.
Insider Trading Policies and Procedures
As of the date of this report, the Company has not
adopted insider trading policies and procedures applicable to its directors, officers, or employees.
The Company is currently in the development stage,
with limited operations and no employees other than its officers and directors. Given this structure and absence of active trading by
insiders, the Board of Directors has determined that a formal insider trading policy is not currently necessary.
The Company intends to adopt formal insider trading policies and procedures
as its operations develop and the scope of its activities expands.
Item 11.
Executive Compensation
For each of the years ended December 31, 2024,
and 2023 there was no direct compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid by us to any of our executive officers and directors.
Employment Contracts
The Company has not entered into any employment
agreements with its officer and director.
Stock Awards Plan
The Company has not adopted a Stock Awards Plan,
but may do so in the future. The terms of any such plan have not been determined.
Granting of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of
Material Nonpublic Information
We do not grant equity awards in
anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock,
and do not time the public release of such information based on award grant dates. During the last completed fiscal year, we have
not made awards to any named executive officer or director during the period beginning four business days before and ending one
business day after the filing of a period report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form
8-K, and we have not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive
compensation.
Director Compensation
The Board of Directors of the Company has not
adopted a stock option plan. The Company has no plans to adopt it but may choose to do so in the future. If such a plan is adopted, this
may be administered by the board or a committee appointed by the board (the “Committee”). The committee would have the power
to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution therefore, provided that any
such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted. The Company may develop an incentive-based stock option plan
for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10% of its outstanding shares of common stock for that purpose.
Board Committees
We have not formed an Audit Committee, Compensation
Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the filing of this Annual Report. Our Board of Directors performs the
principal functions of an Audit Committee. We currently do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors. We
believe that an audit committee financial expert is not required because the cost of hiring an audit committee financial expert to act
as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of having an audit committee financial expert
at this time.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the shareholders and the board of directors
of Un Monde International Ltd f/k/a Asiarim, Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Un Monde International Ltd f/k/a Asiarim, Corp as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations, stockholders'
(deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole10, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
No matters identified in the audit were considered
to be critical audit matters.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of and for the years ended December 31, 2024
and 2023
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
Un Monde International Worldwide Ltd formerly known as Asiarim Corporation
(the “Company”) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 15, 2007. The operations of Asiarim
Corporation and its subsidiaries were abandoned by former management and a custodianship action was commenced in 2016.
On May 5, 2016, the Eighth District Court of Clark County of Nevada
granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation
of the Company’s charter. The order appointed a custodian to take any Corporation actions on behalf of the Company that would further
the interests of its shareholders.
On March 29, 2019, a change of control occurred with respect to the
Company to better reflect its new business direction.
The Company intends to acquire private corporations that are involved
in education and management services offering private, distinguished, specialized, and internationalized education to international students
in schools.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
The Company’s significant estimates include income taxes provision
and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets; the fair value of financial instruments; the carrying value and recoverability of long-lived
assets, including the values assigned to an estimated useful lives of computer equipment; and the assumption that the Company will continue
as a going concern. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties
attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources.
Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available
information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate,
those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-7
Carrying value, recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets
The Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company’s long-lived assets, which include computer equipment are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by
comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their
remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash
flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining
estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly
determined remaining estimated useful lives.
The Company considers the following to be some examples of important
indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical
or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company’s overall strategy
with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company’s overall business strategy; (iii) significant
negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant decline in the Company’s stock price
for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.
The impairment charges, if any, is included in operating expenses in
the accompanying statements of operations.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Related parties
The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the Related parties include a) affiliates
of the Company; b) Entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value
option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing
entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship
of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one
party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) Other parties that can significantly influence the management
or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances,
and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation
of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of
the relationship(s) involved description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed,
for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of
the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income
statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period;
amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner
of settlement.
F-8
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements
are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing
loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings,
the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount
of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that
a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable
but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the
range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless
they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available
at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
Revenue recognition
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using
the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The
five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the
contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant
future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v)
recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.
The adoption of Topic 606 has no impact on revenue amounts recorded
on the Company’s financial statements as the Company has not generate any revenues.
Income Tax Provisions
The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year
in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes
it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive
Income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section
740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
(50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
F-9
Net income (loss) per common share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section
260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of
common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes
that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist of cash deposits and customer receivables. The Company maintains cash with various major
financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these
institutions. To reduce risk, the Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves when
necessary for potential credit losses.
Leases
The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 842,
Leases (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective approach, electing the practical expedient that allows the Company not
to restate its comparative periods prior to the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2019.
The lease standard requires recognition of leases on the balance sheets
as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets
for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Operating
lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future minimum lease payments over the
lease term at commencement date. The Company’s future minimum based payments used to determine the Company’s lease liabilities
mainly include minimum based rent payments. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease
payments. The Company does not recognize any leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheets.
Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized
as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all applicable accounting pronouncements
that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and
the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.
F-10
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company
has net losses, accumulated deficit and a negative working capital without generating any revenues. These factors among others raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
While the Company has not commenced operations and generate revenues,
the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to
raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement
its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that
effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its
business plan and generate revenues.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 4 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT
Common Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 90,000,000 shares of common stock.
On September 9, 2021, the Company effected a one-for-ten reverse stock
split of its common stock. All share and earnings per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock
split was recorded with the offset to additional paid-in capital.
On July 12, 2021, the Company completed the cancellation of 1,276,487
shares of common stock pursuant to an Assignment of Rights agreement dated October 3, 2016 where certain shareholders have entered into
with the Company to return 1,276,487 shares of common stock to the Company.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 6,493,346 shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has no shares issued
and outstanding.
F-11
NOTE 5 – INCOME TAX
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred
tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities
are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted
for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company is using the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%.
The Company has accumulated approximately $2,587,661 of net operating
losses (“NOL”) carried forward to offset future taxable income. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the
deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change
in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no
accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
Mr. Zhang Ci, majority shareholder, director and officer of the Company,
have paid certain expenses on behalf of the Company. Such amounts are due on demand and non-interest bearing. The outstanding amount due
to related parties was $254,736 and $179,860 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
NOTE 7 – COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use
(ROU) assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. For
leases with more than 12 months, the Company recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are at commencement date based
on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is incremental borrowing
rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease.
On May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a commercial lease agreement
for office space to be used as the Company’s headquarter office for private education. The base rent is CA$4,109.16 (US$3,109.35)
per month. This lease was terminated as of December 31, 2023.
On January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a new commercial lease
agreement for office space to be used as the Company’s headquarter office for private education. The base rent is CA$4,366.86 (US$3,295.76)
per month for year 2024 and the base rent will increase subsequently each year.
Operating lease expenses were $28,254 and $24,333
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
