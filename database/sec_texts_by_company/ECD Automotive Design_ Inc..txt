EXPLANATORY NOTE
On April 15, 2025, ECD
Automotive Design, Inc. (the “Company”) filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Original
Form 10-K”). The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 to the Original Form 10-K (the “Amendment”) is to replace the report
of independent registered public accounting firm of Barton CPA PLLC – PCAOB ID #6968 (“Barton CPA”), included in the
Original Form 10-K (the “Original AR Letter”) which contained an inadvertent typographical error in that the Original AR
Letter omitted to reference that the Company’s balance sheet and financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were
covered by Barton CPA’s audit and included in the Original Form 10-K. The Company is hereby filing this Amendment to include a
corrected report of independent registered public accounting firm of Barton CPA PLLC, which states that Barton CPA has “audited
the accompanying balance sheets of ECD Automotive Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries (Humble Imports, Inc. d/b/a ECD Auto Design) (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years
then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.” In this Amendment we have included “F” pages F-1 through F-39 and the corrected report of independent
registered public accounting firm appears on pages F-2 and F-3. No other items in the “F” pages or in the Original Form 10-K
are being amended and this Amendment does not reflect any events that occurred after the filing of the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly,
this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC subsequent
to the filing of the Original Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ECD Automotive Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of ECD Automotive Design, Inc. and Subsidiaries (Humble Imports, Inc. d/b/a ECD Auto Design) (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
F-2
Other Matters
Going Concern
As described in Note 2 to the financial statements,
the Company has sustained significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and are dependent on debt and equity financing to
fund operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient funding, it may struggle to reach its future obligations.
Accordingly, the Company has determined that these
factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date
these financial statements are issued.
Management plans to identify adequate
sources of funding to provide operating capital for continued growth. Auditing the Company’s assessment and related
disclosures regarding its ability to continue as a going concern required significant auditor judgment. This is due to the high
level of uncertainty surrounding the projections and assumptions related to the timing and likelihood of future cash flows,
including external funding. Assessing whether the Company’s disclosures adequately reflect the uncertainty and risks
associated with its going concern status also demanded considerable auditor judgment and effort.
We have served as the Company’s auditor
since 2024.

NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
ECD Automotive Design, Inc (the “Company,”
“ECD,” “we,” “us,” or “our), formerly known as EF Hutton Acquisition Corporation I (“EFHAC”)
(the Company) is engaged in the production and sale of Land Rover vehicle. Since the Company’s commencement of operations in 2013,
they have established a facility geared towards producing the most customized Land Rovers with the highest quality of parts and the highest
quality labor force building each vehicle. The Company primarily earns revenue from the sale of the customized vehicle directly to the
customer. Additionally, revenue is generated from providing repair or upgrade services to customers and from the sale of extended warranties.
On December 12, 2023, ECD completed the business
combination contemplated by the merger agreement dated as of March 3, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among EFHAC, Humble
Imports Inc., d/b/a ECD Auto Design, a Florida corporation (“Humble” or “ECD”), ECD Auto Design UK, Ltd., an England
and Wales corporation (the “ECD UK”), EFHAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned
subsidiary of EFHAC, and Scott Wallace, as the Securityholder Representative. At part of the closing Merger Sub merged with and into ECD
with ECD as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of EFHAC. In connection with the Merger, EFHAC changed its
name to “ECD Automotive Design Inc.” or such other name designated by E.C.D. by notice to EFHAC. See Note 5 for further information.
The business combination was accounted for as
a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, although EFHAC acquired the outstanding equity interest
in ECD in the business combination, EFHAC is treated as the “acquired company” and ECD was treated as the accounting acquirer
for financial statement purposes.  Accordingly, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of ECD issuing stock for the
net assets of EFHAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of EFHAC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other
intangible assets recorded.
Furthermore, the historical financial statements
of ECD became the historical financial statements of the Company upon the consummation of the merger. As a result, the financial statements
included in this Annual Report reflect (i) the historical operating results of ECD prior to the merger; (ii) the combined results of EFHAC
and ECD following the close of the merger; (iii) the assets and liabilities of ECD at their historical cost and (iv) ECD’s equity
structure for all periods presented, as affected by the recapitalization presentation after completion of the merger. See Note 5 - Reverse
Capitalization for further details of the merger.
The Company also consolidates, ECD Audit Design
UK LTD (“ECD UK”), a private limited company incorporated on July 16, 2021 in England and Wales. ECD UK was formed for the
purpose of procuring parts overseas for the Company. ECD UK is a consolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which the
company is the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary of ECD UK as it has both the power to direct the most significant
activities impacting its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits significant to them.

NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash
and cash equivalents of approximately $1.5 million and working capital deficit of approximately $6.0 million. The Company recorded a net
loss of approximately $10.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company’s primary source of operating
funds since inception has been from cash receipts from sales and proceeds from loan payable. Immediately prior to the closing of the Business
Combination on December 12, 2023, the Company executed and delivered to the Lender a senior secured convertible note (the “December
Convertible Note”), in exchange for a loan in the principal amount of $15,819,209. The Convertible Note shall accrue interest at
an annual rate equal to the Prime Interest rate plus 5% per annum which is payable monthly in cash or, upon the Company’s option,
in securities of the Company provided certain conditions are met at the increased interest rate of the Prime Interest rate plus 8% per
annum. The Company is required to pay a late charge of 12% per annum (“Late Charges”) on any amount of principal or other
amounts that are not paid when due. The Convertible Note is convertible into shares of Company Common Stock at the option of the Lender
at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to a one-time downward adjustment on the effective date of the registration statement
providing for the resale of the Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Note to a conversion price equal to the
prior 5-day volume weighted average price, subject to a floor of $6.00. The note has a three-year term. On August 9, 2024, the Company
executed an additional senior secured convertible note (the “August Note”), in exchange for a loan in the principal amount
of $1,154,681. The August Note has the same terms of the December Note. On January 8, 2025, the Company executed an additional senior
secured convertible note (the “January Note”) in exchange for a loan in the principal amount of $1,724,100. The January Note
has the same terms as the December Note and the August Note. On February 20, 2025, the Company entered into a Business Loan and Security
Agreement with Agile Lending, LLC (the “Lending Lender”) pursuant to which the Company received a term loan from the Lending
Lender in the principal amount of $1,575,000 (the “Loan”).
On April 4, 2025, the Company entered into a new
business loan and security agreement with an effective date of April 4, 2025 (the “New Loan Agreement”) by and among an investor
(the “New Lender”), a collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”), the Company and its subsidiary, Humble Imports
Inc., pursuant to which the Company received a term loan from the New Lender in the principal amount of $1,824,300 (the “New Loan”).
The New Loan shall be repaid through sixty-nine (69) equal weekly payments of principal and interest in the aggregate amount of $35,693
per week commencing on April 15, 2025 and ending August 4, 2026 (the “Term”). During the Term, the New Loan shall accrue interest
in the aggregate amount of $638,505. The New Loan included an administrative expense fee of $40,000 and a lender’s legal fee of
$35,000, which sum was netted out of the New Loan. The New Loan is secured by all properties, rights and assets of the Company and Collateral
Agent is designated as the collateral agent under the New Loan Agreement.
The net proceeds of the New Loan were used to
pay off the Agile Loan in the discounted amount of $1,749,300, including principal and interest. Accordingly, the Agile Loan is paid off
and satisfied.
Management’s assessment of the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern involves making a judgement, at a particular point in time, about inherently uncertain future outcomes
of events or conditions. Any judgment about the future is based on information available at the time at which the judgment is made. Subsequent
events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made.
The Company’s future capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including the Company’s revenue growth rate. The Company will need to raise additional financing through
loans or through equity raises. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the new financing will be available to it on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, the Company’s business, results of operations
and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
As a result of the above, in connection with the
Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15,
“Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”, Management has determined that
the Company’s liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through
twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. These consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of ECD and ECD Auto Design UK Ltd. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), expressed in U.S. dollars. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the years presented. References to GAAP issued by the Financial
Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) in these accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are to the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification
Certain amounts from prior period financial statements
have been reclassified to align with the presentation used in the current consolidated financial statements for comparative purposes.
These reclassifications had no material effect on the Company’s previously issued financial statements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Company is an emerging growth company, as
defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent
to the enactment of the JOBS Act, until such time as to those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private
companies until the earlier of the date that it (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts
out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions
used in revenue recognition, useful life of assets, and allowance for doubtful accounts.
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of
an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”), who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assess
performance. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating
financial performance. Accordingly, the Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment and one reportable segment.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
acquired with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated
at cost, which approximates market value, because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Coverage limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not experienced losses on
these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.
F-10
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers
promised goods or services to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations
under the agreement, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract;
(ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in
the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is
entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
No one customer exceeded 10% of revenue for the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Product Revenue – Parts and Builds
The Company generates revenue through the sale
of Land Rover vehicles directly to customers. The Company considers the build/sales contracts to be the contracts with the customer. There
is a single performance obligation in all the Company’s contracts, which is to build a vehicle based on customer specifications,
transfer title and shipping terms in the arrangement. Product revenue is recognized when the product build is completed, and title has
been transferred. The Company concluded that this was the appropriate time to record revenue based on the following criteria. (1) ECD
has a right to full payment for the product. (2) The customer has legal title to the product and (3) The customer has the significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. There are certain build contacts, “owner donor vehicles” where title remains
with the customer for the entire project. Under these contracts, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the truck is shipped back
to the customer.
Upon execution of the contract, the Company bills
its customers the total consideration of the contract. The Company receives approximately 25% to 50% of the total consideration of the
contract from its customers as acceptance of the contract, which is initially recorded as deferred revenue. Upon completion of the build
the remaining 50% is billed and initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as net revenue when the product build is completed,
and title is legally transferred.
Service Revenue
The Company generates revenue through providing
repair or upgrade services to its customers. The Company agrees with the customer on a budget and specific deliverable. This is typically
evidenced by a quote which represents the customer arrangement. There is a single performance obligation, which is the Company’s
promise to perform the repair or upgrade work on the vehicle. The entire transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.
Service revenue is recognized when the repair or upgrade work is completed, and the customer receives the vehicle.
Warranty Revenue
The Company generates revenue through the sale
of extended warranty to customers. The customers agree to the terms and conditions at the time of purchase, which represents the customer
arrangements. The period covered by the extended warranty is usually one year. The Company has elected to apply the optional exemption
provided in ASC 606 and therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance
obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.
Product Limited Warranty
Consistent with industry practice, the Company
generally offers customers a limited warranty for work performed on the vehicle under the builds/sales contract. The customers do not
have a contractual right of return. The Company only offers a limited warranty for the work performed on the vehicle under the contract.
If a customer disputes any work performed, the Company will attempt to remedy the work, however, it shall not be required to discount
the transaction price. The Company considered this an assurance-type warranty and not a separate performance obligation.
Warranty Reserve
The Company provides for the estimated cost of
product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including quality
control test driving vehicles, the warranty obligation is affected by historical warranty costs per vehicle. Should actual costs differ
from the Company’s estimates, revisions to increase or decrease the estimated warranty liability may be required.
F-11
Other Revenue Policies
Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on
behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.
Applying the practical expedient in paragraph
ASC 606-10-32-18, the Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract
inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised products to the customer will be one year
or less, which is the case with substantially all customers.
Applying the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-25-18B,
the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer
the associated products. The Company records the related costs as part of the cost of goods good.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The following table summarizes the Company’s
net revenues disaggregated by product category:

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had customer deposits in the amount of $8,130,324 and $8,326,469, respectively and deferred revenue of $3,672,501 and $7,864,392. The
customer deposits, performance obligations not yet completed, and deferred revenue are typically recognized in revenue at a point in time
within the next twelve months as the custom build vehicles are delivered and title has been transferred to customers.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded at the original
invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing
balances. Management estimates the allowance based on collectability of accounts receivable and prior bad debt experience. Accounts receivable
balances are written off against the allowance upon management’s determination that such accounts are uncollectible. Recoveries
of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Management believes that credit risks on accounts receivable
will not be material to the financial position of the Company or results of operations. The Company had trade accounts receivable of $47,428
as of December 31, 2024 and a recorded allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,406, resulting in a net trade accounts receivable balance
of $45,022. The Company had trade accounts receivable of $138,541 as of December 31, 2023, and a recorded allowance for doubtful accounts
of $138,541, resulting in a net trade accounts receivable balance of $0.
As of December 31, 2024, amounts due from one
customer exceeded 10% of accounts receivable individually and totaled approximately 84% of accounts receivable in the aggregate. No one
customer exceeded 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023.
F-12
Inventories
Work in progress, work in progress – shipping
and consumables, and work in progress – labor costs reported in inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost is determined on the basis of the direct and indirect costs that are directly attributable. The measurement of work in progress inventories
is generally based on the weighted average method. Finished goods inventory is comprised of vehicles for which the build is completed
but title has not been legally transferred, or in some cases, the vehicle has not been delivered. The measurement of finished goods inventories
is the total cost of the materials, shipping and consumables, and labor attributed to the build of each specific completed vehicle. Overhead
costs are allocated to inventory based on the rate of inventory turned for the period.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life of 5 to 15 years.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition is
reflected in earnings.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company follows a “primary asset”
approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for
a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived
assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of the assets will be
adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. No impairments
were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Advertising and Marketing
The Company follows the policy of charging the
costs of advertising and marketing to expense as incurred. The Company charged to operations $1,171,696 and $641,831 as advertising
and marketing costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income Taxes
Prior to the Business Combination on December
13, 2023, the Company was an S corporation. As an S corporation, the Company was not directly liable for federal income taxes. As of the
date of the Business Combination, the operations of the Company ceased to be taxed as a S corporation resulting in a change in tax status
for federal and state income tax purposes.
F-13
The Company follows the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company records deferred tax assets to the
extent management believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in the future. Future realization of deferred
income tax assets (meaning, items that may provide tax deductions in future periods) requires evidence that there will be sufficient taxable
income in those future periods, or within any carryback periods available under tax law. The Company evaluates the realizability of its
deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. The majority of the Company’s deferred tax assets are comprised of income tax carryforwards,
including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and non-deductible interest expense carryforwards. Some
of these carryforwards are subject to annual usage limitations and expiration, while other state NOLs and a portion of federal NOLs do
not have expirations.
While the Company remains in a financial reporting
loss position based on a cumulative pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, the determination of the valuation allowance is
based on its evaluation of the periods over which future taxable items are expected to be utilized to offset tax loss and deduction carryforward
items in those future periods. That is, future forecasts of our taxable income are not considered in the evaluation of realizability of
its deferred tax assets. Therefore, changes in its deferred tax asset valuation allowances will primarily be affected by changes in the
estimates of the time periods over which those future taxable items will occur.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and
a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Management has evaluated
the Company’s tax positions, including its previous status as a pass-through entity for federal and state tax purposes, and has
determined that the Company has taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s reserve related to uncertain tax positions was zero as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management has
evaluated the Company’s tax positions, including its previous status as a pass-through entity for federal and state tax purposes,
and has determined that the Company has taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation
from its position. The open tax years for the tax returns generally include 2021 through 2023 for state and federal reporting purposes.
Loss Per Share
The Company accounts for net loss per share in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”), which requires presentation
of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the statement of operations for all entities with complex capital
structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator
of the diluted EPS. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during each period. It excludes the dilutive effects of any potentially issuable common shares. Diluted net loss per share
is calculated by including any potentially dilutive share issuances in the denominator. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,
all potentially dilutive securities were not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share as their effect would
be anti-dilutive.
F-14
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a
lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and short-term and long-term lease liability are included
on the face of the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU asset represents the right to use an underlying
asset for the lease term and lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU asset and liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. As the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at commencement date over the respective lease term in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s
lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements with terms less than
12 months, the Company has elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption, and it recognizes such lease payments on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company calculates the fair value of its assets
and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and loan payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively
short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of lease liability also approximates fair value since the instrument bears market
rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
●
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;
●
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
●
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure
fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is
categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
F-15
Warrants
The Company determines the accounting classification
of warrants it issues as either liability or equity classified by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification in
accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (“ASC
480”), then in accordance with ASC 815-40 (“ASC 815”), Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock. Under ASC 480, warrants are considered liability classified if the warrants are mandatorily
redeemable, obligate the Company to settle the warrants or the underlying shares by paying cash or other assets, or warrants that must
or may require settlement by issuing variable number of shares. If warrants do not meet liability classification under ASC 480, the Company
assesses the requirements under ASC 815, which states that contracts that require or may require the issuer to settle the contract for
cash are liabilities recorded at fair value, irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring that triggers the net cash settlement
feature. If the warrants do not require liability classification under ASC 815, and in order to conclude equity classification, the Company
also assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its Common Stock and whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815 or
other applicable GAAP. After all relevant assessments, the Company concludes whether the warrants are classified as liability or equity.
The Company accounts for the Common Share Warrants and the Preferred Share Warrants (as defined in Note 13) (collectively, with the Common
Share Warrants, the “Warrants”) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 under which the Warrants do not meet
the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Liability classified warrants require fair value accounting at
issuance and subsequent to initial issuance with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations.
Equity classified warrants only require fair value accounting at issuance with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date.
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Accounting for convertible or redeemable equity
instruments in the Company’s own equity requires an evaluation of the hybrid security to determine if liability classification is
required under ASC 480-10. Liability classification is required for freestanding financial instruments that are not debt in legal form
and are: (1) subject to an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the instrument by transferring assets (i.e. mandatorily
redeemable), (2) instruments other than equity shares that embody an obligation of the issuer to repurchase its equity shares, or (3)
certain types of instruments that obligate the issuer to issue a variable number of equity shares. Securities that do not meet the scoping
criteria to be classified as a liability under ASC 480 are subject to redeemable equity guidance, which prescribes securities that may
be subject to redemption upon an event not solely within the control of the issuer to be classified outside permanent equity (i.e., classified
in temporary equity). Securities classified in temporary equity are initially measured at the proceeds received, net of issuance costs
and excluding the fair value of bifurcated embedded derivatives (if any). Subsequent measurement of the carrying value is not required
unless the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable or is currently redeemable. When the instruments are currently redeemable or
probable of becoming redeemable, the Company will recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying
value of the security to equal the then current maximum redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
awards in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC
718”). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and non-employees including grants of stock options, to be recognized
as expense in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.
The Company periodically issues common stock and
common stock options to consultants for various services.
Convertible Note
The Company determined the fair value option of
the Convertible Note, as described in Note 12, was not appropriate. As such, the Company accounted for the Convertible Note, analyzing
the conversion options embedded in convertible notes in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally requires companies to bifurcate conversion
options embedded in convertible notes from their host instruments and to account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments.
The Company reviews the terms of convertible debt
issued to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be
bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more
than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative
instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
F-16
Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially
recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or
expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted
for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The
remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded
at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the
instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04,
“Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,” which
is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The guidance requires companies that use supplier
finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the
confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll forward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end
of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation
of supplier finance program obligations. The Company adopted the guidance when it became effective on January 1, 2023, except for the
roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not have any supplier
finance programs and accordingly, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements,
and the Company does not believe the impact of adopting the roll-forward requirement in this accounting standard update will be material
to the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
“Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 805). This ASU requires an
acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired
contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it
had originated the acquired contracts. For the Company, the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies
that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures
for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
“Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which will add required disclosures of significant
expenses for each reportable segment, as well as certain other disclosures to help investors understand how the CODM evaluates segment
expenses and operating results. The new standard will also allow disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability, if those measures
are used to allocate resources and assess performance. The amendments will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023. Adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disaggregated information about a reporting
entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors
by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The standard will be effective
for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
“Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of
Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”). The standard requires additional disclosure of certain costs and expenses
within the notes to the financial statements. The provisions of the standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. This accounting standards
update may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard
update on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4. RECAPITALIZATION
As discussed in Note 1, “Nature of Operations”,
On December 12, 2023, ECD completed the business combination (the “Business Combination”) contemplated by the merger agreement,
dated as of March 3, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among EFHT, Humble Imports Inc., d/b/a ECD Auto Design, a Florida
corporation (“Humble” or “ECD”), ECD Auto Design UK, Ltd., an England and Wales corporation (the “ECD UK”),
EFHAC Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of EFHT, and Scott Wallace, as the
Securityholder Representative. The Merger Agreement was previously reported on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by EFHT with the SEC
on March 6, 2023.
At the Closing, pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and after giving effect to the redemptions of shares of EFHT Common Stock:
● the total consideration paid at the Closing (the “Merger Consideration”) by EFHT to Humble security holders was 26,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 25,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock, a warrant to purchase 1,091,525 shares of Company Common Stock, and a warrant to purchase 15,819 shares of Company Preferred Stock, (the “Securities Consideration”), and a cash payment of $2,000,000 pro rata to the former security holders of Humble (the “Cash Consideration” and, collectively with the Securities Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”);
● each share of Merger Sub common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Merger Sub Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one newly issued share of Company Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Following the filing of a Certificate of Merger
with the Florida Department of State, Merger Sub merged with and into Humble with Humble as the surviving corporation, effective December
12, 2023. Thus, Humble became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, the Company changed its name to
“ECD Automotive Design, Inc.”
Although EFHAC was the legal acquirer of ECD in
the merger, ECD is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of ECD became the basis for the historical
financial statements of the Company upon the closing of the merger. ECD was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation
of the following facts and circumstances:
●
ECD’s existing stockholders have the greatest voting interest in the combined company;
●
ECD’s existing stockholders have the ability to control decisions regarding election and removal of directors and officers of the combined company;
●
ECD is the larger entity in terms of substantive operations and employee base;
●
ECD comprises the ongoing operations of the combined company; and
●
ECD’s existing senior management is the senior management of the combined company.
In accordance with guidance applicable to these
circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparable periods up to December 12, 2023, to reflect the number of shares
of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, issued to ECD’s stockholders in connection with the merger. As
such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to ECD’s common stock prior to the merger have
been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the merger.

Edge will make borrowing base advances against ECD’s accounts receivables, up to a limit of 90% of eligible accounts receivable
as determined according to the Loan and Security Agreement. The Edge Facility has a two-year term, subject to renewal at Edge’s
discretion. The advances will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (a) the Base Rate plus (b) 7.00%; the “Base Rate”
means the greater of (i) 6.50% and (ii) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (floating with daily resets) as publicly announced to be in

Securities Purchase Agreement
On October 6, 2023 the Company entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with an institutional Lender (the “Lender”) pursuant to which the Company
issued to the Lender a senior secured convertible note (the “December 2023 Convertible Note”) in exchange for a loan in the
principal amount of $15,819,209. The December 2023 Convertible Note shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Prime Interest
rate plus 5% per annum which is payable monthly in cash, or upon the Company’s option, in securities of the Company provided certain
conditions are met at the increased interest rate of the Prime Interest rate plus 8% per annum. The Company is required to pay a late
charge of 12% per annum (“Late Charges”) on any amount of principal or other amounts that are not paid when due. The December
2023 Convertible Note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share at the option of the
Lender at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to a one-time downward adjustment on the effective date of the registration
statement providing for the resale of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the December 2023 Convertible Note to a conversion
price equal to the prior 5-day volume weighted average price, subject to a floor of $6.00. The conversion price is subject to a downward
adjustment if the Company issues equity in the future at a price less than $10.00, except for equity issued in connection with certain
strategic acquisitions. The conversion price is also subject to a downward adjustment if the Company fails to satisfy certain performance
conditions set forth in the December 2023 Convertible Note. Upon the Lender’s conversion, the conversion amount shall be equal to
115% of the principal amount to be converted under the December 2023 Convertible Note plus any accrued and unpaid interest and accrued
and unpaid Late Charges on such principal and interest, if any (the “Conversion Rate”). Lender’s ability to convert
the December 2023 Convertible Note into shares of common stock is subject to a 4.99% blocker, such that Lender cannot convert the Convertible
Note into shares of common stock to the extent it will make the Lender a beneficial owner of more than 4.99% of the common stock. The
Company has the option to prepay the December 2023 Convertible Note, upon thirty (30) business day written notice, by paying the product
of the 20% redemption premium multiplied by the greater of (i) the conversion amount to be redeemed and (ii) the product of (x) the Conversion
Rate with respect to the conversion amount to be redeemed multiplied by (y) the greatest closing sale price of the Company’s common
stock on any trading day immediately preceding such notice of redemption and the date the Company makes the entire payment required.
F-24
The December 2023 Convertible Note has a maturity
date of December 12, 2026 and will rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries. The December
2023 Convertible Notes are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all the existing and future assets of the Company
and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including a pledge of all of the capital stock of each of the subsidiaries. The December 2023
Convertible Note also provides that the Company and its subsidiaries execute a guaranty (the “Guaranty”) to guaranty the obligations
under the December 2023 Convertible Note and the Security Agreement, that all insider stockholders of the common stock shall execute a
lock-up agreement (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) restricting their sale of the common stock until six months after the registration
statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the December 2023 Convertible Note is declared effective and a joinder agreement
(the “Joinder Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company and its Subsidiaries agree and consent to be parties to the Security
Agreement.
On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a
SPA with the Lender pursuant to which the Company issued to the Lender a senior secured convertible note (the “August 2024 Convertible
Note”) in exchange for a loan in the principal amount of $1,154,681. The August 2024 Convertible Note has the same terms and conditions
as the December 2023 Convertible Note.
Certain events of default under the December 2023
Convertible Note and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have occurred based on the following: the Company’s failure to have
its resale registration statement on Form S-1 declared effective by the SEC within sixty (60) days of December 12, 2023, the financial
statements of the Company’s subsidiary for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the quarterly periods ended March 31,
2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023 were required to be restated, the fact that the Company did not file its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”) within two (2) trading days of the filing due date of the
Form 10-K and the Company did not file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023 (the “Form
10-Q”) within two (2) trading days of the filing due date of the Form 10-Q. The Convertible Note and the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock each provide for certain remedies based upon the occurrence of an event of default. As a result of the default the lender under
the Convertible Note who is also the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock calculated default interest on the Convertible
Note of an additional 8% of the principal balance outstanding for seventeen (17) days in May 2024 and an additional 8% of the principal
balance outstanding for thirty (30) days in June 2024 (the “Default Interest”). The total Default Interest calculated for
the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $165,233 in the aggregate. The lender has agreed to treat the Default Interest as paid-in-kind
interest (“PIK interest”) and the accrued Default Interest was added to the principal balance of the Convertible note on July
1, 2024. In addition, under the terms of the December 2023 Convertible Note and the August 2024 Convertible Note, the Company has accrued
default interest from the period from the date the company failed to have its resale registration statement on Form S-1 declared effective
by the SEC in February 2024 through September 30, 2024, excluding the period for which the Lender calculated the Default Interest, in
the amount of $660,292 (the “Additional Default Interest”). Pursuant to the execution of the August 2024 Convertible Note,
the Lender agreed to waive the pre-existing events of default that occurred under the December 2023 Convertible Note and as a result,
the company recognized a gain on forgiveness of payable of $319,900 in the consolidated statements of operations.
The December 2023 Convertible Note includes an
original issue discount of $2,148,217 and debt issuance costs of $3,088,883. The August 2024 Convertible Note includes an original issue
discount of $287,212 and debt issuance costs of $95,000. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $753,904
and $29,433, respectively, of amortization expense of the debt discount and $1,042,141 and $42,901, respectively, of amortization expense
of the debt issuance costs in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest on the December
2023 Convertible Note and the August 2024 Convertible Note, including the Additional Default Interest, was $569,419 and $113,000, respectively,
as included with accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11.

NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES
Historically, ECD was an S Corporation and as
such, the Company was not directly liable for income taxes for federal purposes. As of the date of the Business Combination (December
2023), the operations of the Company ceased to be taxed as an S Corporation resulting in a change in tax status for federal and state
income tax purposes. This change in tax status requires immediate recognition of any deferred tax assets or liabilities as of the transaction
date as the Company will now be directly liable for income taxes. The recognition of these initial deferred balances, if any, would be
recorded as an additional tax expense in the period of the transaction. In addition, the Company will accrue current and deferred tax
expense based on ongoing activity from that date.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had federal net operating losses of approximately $8.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and state net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $8.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $0 and $0.5 million, respectively. The federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards
generated in the tax years 2024 and 2023 will never expire. Certain Net Operating Losses in these jurisdictions are not subject to expiration.
Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation according to Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, and similar provisions.
ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a valuation
allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all of the evidence, the Company has recorded a valuation
allowance against all its Federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets at December 31, 202, because management has determined it is
more likely than not that the Company will be unable to recognize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2023, the
Company only recorded a valuation allowance against its foreign deferred tax assets because management has determined that it is more
likely than not that the Company will recognize the benefits of its federal and state deferred tax assets, but not for its foreign deferred
tax assets, primarily due to its lack of revenue generating operations since inception.
The Company recognizes interest accrued to unrecognized
tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. The Company accrued total penalties and interest of $0 during the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023 and in total, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 has recognized penalties and interest of $0.
F-31
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
has not recorded an amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions for the current or prior year planned tax filing
positions. No unrecognized tax benefits are applicable for prior periods.
The Company files tax returns as prescribed by
the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal
and foreign jurisdictions where applicable based on the statute of limitations that apply in each jurisdiction. As of December 31,
2024, the open tax years are December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.
The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing
authority as of December 31, 2024.
The Company actively monitors domestic and global
tax law changes to account for the effects in the period the legislation is enacted, as applicable.
NOTE 16. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company.
Dividend Rights
From and after the first date of issuance of any
initial shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Initial Issuance Date”) and prior to the date of the initial
exercise of the Preferred Warrants (the “Initial Preferred Warrant Exercise Date”), unless a triggering event has occurred
and is continuing, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to dividends. From and after the Initial Preferred
Warrant Exercise Date, dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall commence accruing and shall be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months and shall be payable in arrears for on the first trading day of each fiscal quarter (each,
an “Dividend Date”). Dividends shall be payable on each Dividend Date, to each record holder of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock on the applicable Dividend Date, in shares of Common Stock (“Dividend Shares”) so long as there has been no Equity Conditions

(“Cash Dividend”) or in a combination of Cash Dividend and Dividend Shares.
Liquidation Preference
In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the stockholders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders
(the “Liquidation Funds”), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of junior stock, but pari passu
with any parity stock then outstanding, an amount per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the sum of (i) the Black
Scholes Value (as defined in the Common Warrants) with respect to the outstanding portion of all Common Warrants held by such holder (without
regard to any limitations on the exercise thereof) as of the date of such event and (ii) the greater of (A) 125% of the Conversion Amount
(as defined below) of such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such holder would
receive if such holder converted such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment,
provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders and holders of shares of parity stock,
then each holder and each holder of parity stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to such holder and such holder of parity stock as a liquidation preference, in accordance with their respective certificate
of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock and all holders of shares of parity stock.
Conversion and Redemption Rights
At any time after the Business Combination, each
stockholder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by such stockholder
into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of any Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing (i) the Conversion Amount (as defined in the Certificate of
Designation) of such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock by (y) $10.00 (subject to adjustments). A stockholder’s ability to convert
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock is subject to a 4.99% blocker, such that a stockholder cannot convert
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent it will make the stockholder a beneficial owner of more
than 4.99% of the Common Stock.
F-32
The stockholders of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock have redemption rights upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation). The Company has
the right to redeem all or any part of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.

Warrants — As part of EFHAC’s
initial public offering (“IPO”), EFHAC issued warrants to third-party investors where each whole warrant entitles the holder
to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”).
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, EFHAC completed the private sale of warrants where each warrant allows the holder to purchase
one share of the Company’s common stock at $11.50 per share. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there are 11,500,000 Public Warrants
and 257,500 Private warrants outstanding.
The Public Warrants and the Private Warrants expire
on the fifth anniversary of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation and are exercisable commencing 30 days
after the Business Combination, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits
holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement) and registered, qualified
or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder.
Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the
Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:
● in whole and not in part;
● at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
● upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
● if, and only if, the reported last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (the “Reference Value”) equals or exceeds $18.00 per share.
The Company accounts for the 11,757,500 warrants
issued in connection with the IPO in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Such guidance provides that the warrants described
above are not precluded from equity classification. Equity-classified contracts are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value).
Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the contracts continue to be classified in equity.
On August 8, 2024, the Company entered into a
subscription agreement with Second Investor pursuant to which the Company issued 100,000 warrants (the “Duncan Warrants”).

NOTE 18. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Policy
EFHT’s Code of Ethics requires it to avoid,
wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines
approved by the Board (or the audit committee). The Code of Ethics defines related party transactions as transactions in which (i) the
aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (ii) EFHT or any of EFHT’s subsidiaries
is a participant, and (iii) any (A) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (B) greater than 5% beneficial
owner of shares of Common Stock, or (C) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (A) and (B), has or will have a
direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another
entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform
his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives
improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.
EFHT’s audit committee, pursuant to its
written charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that EFHT enters into such transactions.
All ongoing and future transactions between EFHT and any of EFHT’s officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be
on terms believed by EFHT to be no less favorable to EFHT than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require
prior approval by EFHT’s audit committee and a majority of EFHT’s uninterested “independent” directors, or the
members of the Board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at EFHT’s expense, to EFHT’s
attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless EFHT’s audit committee and a majority
of EFHT’s disinterested “independent” directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to
EFHT than those that would be available to EFHT with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, EFHT
requires each of EFHT’s directors and executive officers to complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that elicits
information about related party transactions.
These procedures are intended to determine whether
any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director,
employee or officer.
Certain Transactions of ECD
Beginning on January 5, 2021, ECD entered into

NOTE 20. SEGMENT
ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,”
establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statement information about operating segments, products, services, geographic
areas, and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from
which it may recognize revenues and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated
by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer who reviews the assets, liabilities, operating results, and financial
metrics for the Company as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, management
has determined that there is only one reportable segment.
The CODM assesses performance for the single segment
and decides how to allocate resources based on net income or loss that also is reported on the statement of operations as net income or
loss. The measure of segment assets and liabilites is reported on the balance sheet as total assets and total liabilities. When evaluating
the Company’s performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics included
in net income or loss, total assets and total liabilities, which include the following:
