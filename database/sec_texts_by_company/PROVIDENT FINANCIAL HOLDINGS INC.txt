The Corporation is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (âFederal Reserveâ). At June 30, 2025, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $1.25 billion, total deposits of $888.8 million and stockholdersâ equity of $128.5 million. The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (âForm 10-Kâ), including the audited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. As used in this report, the terms âwe,â âour,â âus,â and the âCorporationâ refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. When we refer to the âProvidentâ in this report, we are referring to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. Â When we refer to the âBankâ or âProvident Savings Bankâ in this report, we are referring to Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., a wholly owned subsidiary of Provident.âThe Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (âOCCâ), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (âFDICâ), the insurer of its deposits. The Bankâs deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (âFHLBâ) â San Francisco since 1956.âThe Bank is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp (âPFCâ). The business activities of the Bank consist of community banking, investment services and trustee services for real estate transactions.âThe Bankâs community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full-service offices and investing those funds in the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for investment. Through its subsidiary, PFC, the Bank conducts trustee services for the Bankâs real estate transactions and in the past has held real estate for investment. For additional information, see âSubsidiary Activitiesâ in this Form 10-K. The activities of PFC are included in the Bank's operating segment results. The Bankâs revenues are derived principally from interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios, and fees generated through its community banking activities.âOn June 22, 2006, the Bank established the Provident Savings Bank Charitable Foundation (âFoundationâ) in order to further its commitment to the local community. The specific purpose of the Foundation is to promote and provide for the betterment of youth, education, housing and the arts in the Bankâs primary market areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The Foundation was funded with a $500,000 charitable contribution made by the Bank in fiscal 2006. The Bank contributed $40,000 to the Foundation in both fiscal 2025 and 2024.âSubsequent EventâOn July 24, 2025, the Corporation announced that the Provident Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per share. Shareholders of Provident common stock at the close of business on August 14, 2025 were entitled to receive the cash dividend, payable on September 4, 2025.â1
Table of ContentsMarket AreaâThe Bank is headquartered in Riverside, California and, as of June 30, 2025, operates 12 full-service banking offices in Riverside County and one full-service banking office in San Bernardino County. Management considers Southern California, including Riverside County, western San Bernardino County (collectively, the âInland Empireâ), and surrounding counties, to be the Bankâs primary market, with the Inland Empire its primary market area for deposits. Based on the most recent FDIC data, the Bank was the largest independent community bank (based on total assets) headquartered in Riverside County and held the 11th largest deposit market share of all banks in the county, with the second largest share among community banks.âAccording to the 2020 Census Bureau, Riverside and San Bernardino counties have the fourth and fifth largest populations in California, respectively, and are part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting primarily of suburban and urban communities.Â The Inland Empire, with a population of approximately 4.7 million, is relatively densely populated. The U.S. Department of Laborâs Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unemployment rate of 5.9% in the Inland Empire in June 2025, slightly higher than Californiaâs rate of 5.4% and the national rate of 4.1%. In June 2024, these rates were 5.3% in the Inland Empire, 5.2% in California, and 4.1% nationwide. Economic growth for the Inland Empire, also known as the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical Area, is expected to rise modestly in 2025. Last year, the outlook was highlighted with concerns about potential headwinds related the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election. This negatively impacted both consumer and business spending decisions and future investment plans. These uncertainties have been replaced by policy decisions by the new administration regarding (i) tariffs, (ii) deportation, (iii) fiscal policy (especially taxes), and (iv) regulation, making forecasting difficult. Â Regardless, the beginning of an expansive consumer credit policy has begun with the previous interest cuts in 2024, and it is expected to continue. This is expected to generate positive impulses for the Inland Empire economy, which is expected to outperform the state economy but not the national economy. The outlook for 2025 is based on the assumption that the administrationâs proposed policies on tariffs and deportation will not have an immediate effect on trade and construction. Part of this is the larger role that the logistics industry plays in the Inland Empire. Transportation, warehousing, and wholesale have moved into third place in terms of overall employment share and represent the largest share in San Bernardino County (third largest in Riverside County). The opening of new facilities in 2025 will require new workers, and the continuation of consumption of imported goods by U.S. consumers will continue to drive growth in this segment, subject to the outcome of tariff negotiations with Mexico and Canada.

The statewide annualized sales figure represents what would be the total number of homes sold during 2025 if sales maintained the June 2025 pace throughout the year. It is adjusted to account for seasonal factors that typically influence home sales. June home sales activity rose 4.0 percent from the 254,190 homes sold in May 2025 and was down 0.3 percent from a year ago, when 264,960 homes were sold on an annualized basis. The June result reversed three consecutive months of sales declines and was only one of two months of sales increases for the first half of 2025. The year-over-year decline marked the third straight monthly decrease and was the first time since late 2023 that annual sales fell for three consecutive months. Year-to-date sales were slightly above a year ago. Statewide pending sales in June slipped from last yearâs level for the seventh consecutive month, posting the largest year-over-year drop since January 2025. Californiaâs median home price fell for the second straight month in June, slipping below the $900,000 mark for the first time in three months. The June median price of $899,560 was down 0.1 percent from May and also down 0.1 percent from $900,720 in June 2024. The decline in June was not in line with the Juneâs historical average gain of 0.8 percent, suggesting non-seasonal factors such as market uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates had a negative lingering effect on housing demand and home prices.

The population growth in the Inland Empire has attracted numerous financial institutions to the Bankâs market area. The Bankâs primary competitors are large national and regional commercial banks as well as other community-oriented banks and savings institutions. The Bank also faces competition from credit unions and mortgage companies, as well as unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these institutions are significantly larger 2
Table of Contentsthan the Bank and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than the Bank. This competition may limit the Bankâs growth and profitability in the future.âReportable SegmentsâManagement monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and services the Bank offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is developed each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to the Corporationâs audited consolidated financial statements and Note 17, âSegment Reportingâ of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âInternet WebsiteâThe Corporation maintains a website at www.myprovident.com. The information contained on that website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K. Other than an investorâs own internet access charges, the Corporation makes available free of charge through that website the Corporationâs annual report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, including amendments to these reports, if any, as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ). In addition, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding companies filed electronically with the SEC. This information is available at www.sec.gov.âLending ActivitiesâGeneral. The lending activity of the Bank is comprised of the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for investment. Additional lending activities have historically included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first trust deed mortgages. The Bankâs net loans held for investment were $1.05 billion at June 30, 2025, representing 84% of consolidated total assets. This compares to $1.05 billion, or 83% of consolidated total assets, at June 30, 2024.âAt June 30, 2025, the maximum amount the Bank could have loaned to any one borrower and the borrowerâs related entities under applicable regulations was $19.7 million, or 15% of the Bankâs unimpaired capital and surplus.Â At that date, the Bank had no individual loan or aggregate loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. The Bankâs five largest lending relationships at June 30, 2025 consisted of: four multi-family loans totaling $4.9 million to a group of related borrowers; three multi-family loans totaling $4.0 million to a group of related borrowers; one multi-family loan of $4.0 million; one multi-family loan of $3.9 million; and one multi-family loan of $3.7 million. The real estate collateral securing these loans is primarily located in Southern and Northern California. At June 30, 2025, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their contractual repayment terms.â3

The average life of loans is generally substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses generally give the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property that secures the loan. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current market interest rates are substantially higher than the interest rates on existing loans held for investment and, conversely, decrease when the interest rates on existing loans held for investment are substantially higher than current market interest rates, as borrowers are generally less inclined to refinance their loans when market rates increase and more inclined to refinance their loans when market rates decrease.âThe table below describes the geographic dispersion of real estate secured loans held for investment (gross) at June 30, 2025 and 2024, as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding (dollars in thousands):âAs of June 30, 2025:ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââInlandâSouthernâOtherâOtherâââââÂ ââEmpire(1)âCalifornia(2)âCaliforniaâStatesâTotalÂ Loan CategoryâBalanceâ%âBalanceâ%âBalanceâ%âBalanceâ%âBalanceâ%Â Single-familyÂ Â Â Â $ 143,217Â Â Â Â  26%Â Â $ 179,162Â Â Â Â  33%Â Â $ 221,819Â Â Â Â  41%Â Â $ 227Â Â Â Â  â%Â Â $ 544,425Â Â Â Â  100%Multi-familyâÂ  50,450Â  12%Â Â Â  243,790Â  58%Â Â Â  129,177Â  30%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  423,417Â  100%Commercial real estateâÂ  13,744Â  19%Â Â Â  39,213Â  54%Â Â Â  19,809Â  27%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  72,766Â  100%ConstructionâÂ  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  402Â  100%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  402Â  100%OtherâÂ  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  89Â  100%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Â  89Â  100%Totalâ$ 207,411Â  20%Â Â $ 462,656Â  44%Â Â $ 370,805Â  36%Â Â $ 227Â  â%Â Â $ 1,041,099Â  100%â(1)Comprised of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.(2)Other than the Inland Empire.â5

One of the Bankâs primary lending activities is the origination and purchase of adjustable and fixed rate mortgage loans to be held for investment, secured by first trust deed mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family (one to four units) residences in the communities where the Bankâs branches are located and surrounding areas in Southern and Northern California. During fiscal 2025, the Bank originated $92.5 million of single-family loans to be held for investment, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bankâs origination guidelines, and did not purchase any single-family loans. This compares to single-family loan originations of $40.9 million and no loan purchases during fiscal 2024. At June 30, 2025, total single-family loans held for investment increased 5% to $544.4 million, or 52% of the total loans held for investment, from $518.1 million, or 49% of the total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2024. The increase in the single-family loans in fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to new loans originated for investment that exceeded loan principal payments. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries from non-performing single-family loans. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, total non-performing single-family loans were $948,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, net of allowances and charge-offs, andÂ there were no loans past due 30 to 89 days at both dates. âThe Bank has underwriting standards that generally conform with the standards of the government sponsored entities (âGSEâ) which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage insurance is usually required for all loans exceeding 80% loan-to-value (âLTVâ) based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination. The Bank is not currently offering loans with LTV ratios greater than 90%. Currently, the maximum LTV ratio is 90% for new purchase transactions and limited cash-out refinances and 75% for cash-out refinances.Â The maximum loan amount offered on single-family homes is $1.5 million. A limited cash-out refinance limits cash back to the borrower to the lesser of 2% of the new loan amount or $2,000. The minimum FICO score currently accepted for a purchase or no cash-out refinance transaction is 700, while the minimum FICO score for a cash-out refinance transaction is 720. The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrowerâs credit history, as reported by an independent third party.Â A higher FICO score indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness.Â Bank regulators have issued guidance stating that a FICO score of 660 and below is indicative of a âsubprimeâ borrower. âThe Bank currently lends on residential properties classified as single-family units, planned unit developments and condominiums.Â Underwriting standards and guidelines may change at any time, based on shifts in real estate market conditions or changes to GSE policies and guidelines. To enhance protection, the Bank purchases lender-paid mortgage insurance for certain single-family mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2025, a total of approximately $149.0 million of single-family mortgage loans, with a 78% weighted average LTV at the time of origination have lender-paid mortgage insurance. This insurance provides a weighted average coverage ratio of approximately 11% of the original loan amount.âPrior to fiscal 2009, many of the loans we originated for investment consisted of non-traditional single-family residential loans that do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines as a result of the characteristics of the borrower or property, the loan terms, loan size or exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines. In exchange for the additional risk to us associated with these loans, these borrowers generally are required to pay a higher interest rate, and depending on the credit history, a lower loan-to-value ratio was generally required than for a conforming loan. Our non-traditional single-family residential loans include loans to borrowers who provided limited or no documentation of their 6
Table of Contentsincome or stated income loans, negative amortization loans (a loan in which accrued interest exceeding the required monthly loan payment is added to loan principal up to 115% of the original loan amount), more than 30-year amortization loans, and loans to borrowers with a FICO score below 660 (these loans are considered subprime by the OCC).As of June 30, 2025, these non-traditional loans totaled $16.9 million, comprising 3% of total single-family residential loans held for investment and 2% of total loans held for investment, with a weighted average seasoning of 16.6 years. At that date, stated income loans totaled $11.3 million, more than 30-year amortization loans totaled $5.7 million, low FICO score loans totaled $1.6 million, and negative amortization loans totaled $380,000 (the outstanding balances described may overlap more than one category).The Bank currently offers fixed-rate loans in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, along with adjustable-rate mortgage (âARMâ) loans throughout California. Substantially all the loans originated by the Bank comply with GSE underwriting standards concerning credit and collateral. The Bankâs ARM products offer various options, with interest rates adjusting every six months after an initial fixed period of five to ten years. These adjustments are limited by caps on semi-annual and lifetime rate changes. âCurrently, the Bankâs ARM programs have interest rates that consist of an index tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (âSOFRâ), plus a margin. The programs are subject to a maximum semi-annual increase or decrease of one percentage point and a maximum lifetime increase of five percentage points, and the rate may not fall below the margin. The portfolio primarily consists of the following indices, with a margin generally ranging from 2.00% to 4.00%, which are used to calculate the periodic interest rate changes: SOFR, the 12-month average U.S. Treasury rate (â12 MATâ), or the weekly average yield on one-year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (âCMTâ). Loans based on the SOFR index constitute a majority of the Bankâs loans held for investment. The majority of the ARM loans held for investment have five, seven, orÂ 10-year fixed periods prior to the first adjustment and provide for fully amortizing payments throughout the term of the loan. These loans have embedded interest rate risk, which may arise if interest rates increase during the initial fixed rate period or if rates rise beyond the periodic or lifetime caps.âBorrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each product in a given interest rate and competitive environment.âThe retention of ARM loans, rather than fixed-rate loans, helps to reduce the Bankâs exposure to changes in interest rates. There is, however, unquantifiable credit risk resulting from the potential of increased interest charges to be paid by the borrower as a result of increases in interest rates. It is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of the increase in the required payment from the borrower. Further, the risk of default may increase because ARM loans originated by the Bank occasionally provide, as a marketing incentive, for initial rates of interest below those rates that would apply if the adjustment index plus the applicable margin were initially used for pricing. Because of these characteristics, ARM loans are subject to increased risks of default or delinquency. Additionally, while ARM loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its assets as a result of changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.Â Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in the Bankâs cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates.Â Conversely, downward adjustments on the Bankâs cost of funds typically lag adjustments on ARM loans which may occur more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates on our loan portfolio, see Item 7A, âQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Riskâ of this Form 10-K.âThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the âDodd-Frank Actâ) requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrowerâs ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory enforcement actions result from these rules. The Bank may originate loans that do not meet the definition of a âqualified mortgageâ (âQMâ). To mitigate the risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes, procedural and product changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the âability-to-repayâ requirements are adequately addressed.7
Table of ContentsâA decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Bankâs control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, housing supply and demand, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, fires, droughts and other natural disasters particular to California where substantially all of our real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline from the levels at the time of loan origination, the value of our real estate collateral securing the loans could be significantly reduced. The Bankâs ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely that the Bank could suffer losses on defaulted loans.âMulti-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2025, multi-family loans were $423.4 million and commercial real estate loans were $72.8 million, or 41% and 7%, respectively, of loans held for investment. This compares to multi-family loans of $445.2 million and commercial real estate loans of $83.3 million, or 42% and 8%, respectively, of loans held for investment at June 30, 2024. Consistent with its strategy to diversify the composition of loans held for investment, the Bank has emphasized the balance between single-family loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans. During fiscal 2025, the Bank originated $28.9 million in multi-family and commercial real estate loans and did not purchase any loans. This compares to fiscal 2024, when $31.9 million of such loans were originated and no loans were purchased. As of June 30, 2025, the average outstanding loan balance was approximately $713,000 for multi-family loans and approximately $720,000 for commercial real estate loans.âThe multi-family loans originated by the Bank are predominately adjustable-rate loans, including hybrid ARM loans, with terms ranging from 10 to 30 years and amortization schedules of 25 to 30 years. Similarly, the Bankâs commercial real estate loans are mainly adjustable-rate loans, also including hybrid ARM loans, with the same maturity terms and amortization schedules. The interest rates on multi-family and commercial real estate ARM loans generally adjust monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, based on a specific margin over the relevant interest rate index and are subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. At June 30, 2025, $407.1 million, or 96%, of the Bankâs multi-family loans were secured by projects with five to 36 units. The Bankâs commercial real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of loans secured by small office buildings, light industrial buildings, warehouses, and small retail centers. The properties securing these loans are mainly located in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and San Francisco. The Bank typically originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans in amounts ranging from $350,000 to $6.0 million. At June 30, 2025, the Bank had 52 commercial real estate and multi-family loans with principal balances greater than $1.5 million, totaling $114.9 million. Appraisals are obtained for all properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The underwriting process for these loans includes a thorough analysis of the property's cash flows to ensure adequate debt service coverage, as well as an evaluation of the financial resources, experience, and income levels of the borrowers and guarantors.âMulti-family and commercial real estate loans afford the Bank an opportunity to price the loans with higher interest rates than those generally available from single-family mortgage loans. However, loans secured by such properties are generally greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and are more susceptible to default as a result of general economic conditions and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. During both fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on multi-family and commercial real estate loans.Â At June 30, 2025 and 2024, $466,000 and $0, respectively, were non-performing and no multi-family and commercial real estate loans were 30 to 89 days delinquent.Â Non-performing and delinquent loans may increase in the event of a general decline in California real estate markets or if adverse economic conditions prevail.âConstruction Loans. The Bank originates from time to time two types of construction loans: short-term construction loans and construction/permanent loans. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank originated a total of $725,000 and $1.5 million of construction loans (including undisbursed loan funds), respectively. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had construction loans totaling $402,000 and $2.7 million, net of undisbursed loan funds of $529,000 and $435,000, respectively. On these dates, the loans consisted of bridge loans totaling $206,000 and $1.5 million, short-term construction loans totaling $0 and $228,000, and construction/permanent loans totaling $196,000 and $984,000 respectively.8
Table of ContentsâShort-term construction loans include three types of loans: custom construction, tract construction, and speculative construction. The Bank provides construction financing for single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate properties. Custom construction loans are made to individuals who, at the time of application, have a contract executed with a builder to construct their residence. Custom construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 to 18 months, with adjustable or fixed interest rates at the prime lending rate plus a margin and with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. The owner secures long-term permanent financing at the completion of construction. At both June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no custom short-term single-family construction loans. âFrom time to time the Bank makes lot loans to individuals to finance land acquisition prior to the start of construction or tract construction loans to subdivision builders. These subdivisions are usually financed and built in phases. A thorough analysis of market trends and demand within the area are reviewed for feasibility. Tract construction may include the building and financing of model homes under a separate loan.Â At June 30, 2025 and 2024, there was one land loan of $89,000 and 95,000 (reported as other mortgage loans), respectively, and no tract construction loans at both dates.âSpeculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed âspeculativeâ because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed sale contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Bank or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified during or after the construction period. The builder may be required to debt service the speculative construction loan for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until the homebuyer is identified. At both June 30, 2025, the Bank had no speculative construction loans, as compared to one speculative construction loan of $228,000, net of undisbursed loan funds of $32,000 at June 30, 2024.âConstruction/permanent loans automatically roll from the construction to the permanent phase. The construction phase generally lasts 12 to 18 months and the interest rate charged is generally fixed at a margin above prime rate and with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% of the appraised value of the completed property.Â At June 30, 2025, there were $196,000 of construction/permanent loans, net of undisbursed loan funds of $529,000 as compared to $984,000 of construction/permanent loans, net of undisbursed loan funds of $403,000, at June 30, 2024.âConstruction loans under $1.0 million are approved by Bank personnel specifically designated to approve construction loans. The Bankâs Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Senior Vice President â Single-Family Division and Vice President - Loan Administration, approves all construction loans over $1.0 million. Prior to approval of any construction loan, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and the Bank reviews the existing or proposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project, and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on the project. In the case of a tract or speculative construction loan, the Bank also reviews the experience and expertise of the builder. The Bank obtains credit reports, financial statements and tax returns on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent appraisal of the project, and any other expert report necessary to evaluate the proposed project. In the event of cost overruns, the Bank requires the borrower to deposit their own funds into a loan-in-process account, which the Bank disburses consistent with the completion of the subject property pursuant to a revised disbursement schedule.âThe construction loan documents require that construction loan proceeds be disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Disbursements are based on periodic on-site inspections by independent inspectors and/or Bank personnel.Â At inception, the Bank also requires borrowers to deposit funds into a loan-in-process account covering the difference between the actual cost of construction and the loan amount. The Bank regularly monitors the construction loan portfolio, economic conditions and housing inventory.Â The Bankâs property inspectors perform periodic inspections.Â The Bank believes that the internal monitoring system helps reduce many of the risks inherent in its construction loans.âConstruction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than its single-family mortgage loans.Â Construction loans, however, are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family mortgage loans because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a propertyâs value at completion of the project and the cost of the project. The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and monitor. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project.Â If the estimate of value upon completion 9
Table of Contentsproves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. Projects may also be jeopardized by disagreements between borrowers and builders and by the failure of builders to pay subcontractors. Loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan depends on the builderâs ability to sell the property prior to the time that the construction loan matures.Â The Bank has sought to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. In addition, because the Bankâs construction lending is in its primary market area, changes in the local or regional economy and real estate market could adversely affect the Bankâs construction loans held for investment. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on construction loans, and no construction loans were non-performing or 30-89 days delinquent at both June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024.âParticipation Loan Purchases and Sales. To expand production and diversify risk, the Bank purchases loans and loan participations, primarily with collateral located in California, which allows for greater geographic distribution outside of the Bankâs primary lending areas. The Bank typically purchases between 50% and 100% of the total loan amount. When purchasing a participation loan, the lead lender usually retains a servicing fee, which reduces the loan yield to approximately the cost the Bank would incur if it serviced the loan itself. All properties serving as collateral for these loan participations are inspected by either a Bank employee or a third-party inspection service before being approved by the Loan Committee. The Bank uses the same underwriting criteria for these purchases as it does for loans it originates. The Bank did not purchase any loans to be held for investment in fiscal 2025 and 2024, due primarily to concerns over asset quality in light of the current economic climate and fewer loans available for purchase. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were $1.7 million and $1.8 million of loans serviced by other financial institutions, respectively.Â As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, all loans serviced by others were performing according to their original contractual payment terms, except for one loan totaling $362,000 that was classified as non-performing as of June 30, 2024. âThe Bank also sells participating interests in loans when it has been determined that it is beneficial to diversify the Bankâs risk. Participation sales enable the Bank to maintain acceptable loan concentrations and comply with the Bankâs loans to one borrower policy. Generally, selling a participating interest in a loan increases the yield to the Bank on the portion of the loan that is retained. The Bank did not sell any participation loans in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024.âCommercial Business Loans. The Bank has a Business Banking Department that primarily serves businesses located within the Inland Empire. Commercial business loans allow the Bank to diversify its lending and increase the average loan yield. As of June 30, 2025, commercial business loans were $1.3 million, down from $1.4 million at June 30, 2024. These loans represent secured and unsecured lines of credit and term loans secured by business assets.âCommercial business loans are generally made to customers who are well known to the Bank and are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, business equipment and/or other assets. The Bankâs commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above the prime rate and term loans are at a fixed or variable rate. The Bank may also require personal guarantees from financially capable parties associated with the business, based on a review of personal financial statements. Commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are typically approved with a term of one year or less.âCommercial business loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans and involve risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate loans. Real estate loans are generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral value and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets including real estate, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may not be collectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is secondary and oftentimes an insufficient source of repayment. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no non-performing commercial business loans.Â During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on commercial business loans.â10
Table of ContentsConsumer Loans. At June 30, 2025, the Bankâs consumer loans were $57,000, down from $65,000 at June 30, 2024. The Bank offers open-ended lines of credit on an unsecured basis, primarily deposit overdraft lines of credit.âConsumer loans potentially have a greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowerâs ongoing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. The Bank had no non-performing consumer loans at both June 30, 2025 and 2024. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on consumer loans.âLoans Originations, Purchases, Sales and RepaymentsâMortgage loans are primarily originated for investment. Prior to scaling back originations of saleable single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans during fiscal 2019, a large amount of single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans were originated for sale to institutional investors. Mortgage loans sold to investors generally were sold without recourse other than standard representations and warranties.Â Generally, mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were sold on a non-recourse basis and foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the purchaser and not the Bank, except in the case of Federal Housing Administration (âFHAâ) and Veteransâ Administration (âVAâ) loans used to form Government National Mortgage Association pools, which are subject to limitations on the FHAâs and VAâs loan guarantees.âThe following table shows the Bankâs loan originations, purchases, sales and principal repayments during the periods indicated. No loans were purchased during the periods indicated:ââââââââ ââYear Ended JuneÂ 30,Â (In Thousands)Â Â Â Â 2025Â Â Â Â 2024âââââââLoans originated for sale:Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Wholesale originationsâ$ 4,580â$ 5,605Total loans originated for saleâÂ  4,580âÂ  5,605âââââââLoans sold:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Servicing retainedâÂ  (4,580)âÂ  (5,605)Total loans soldâÂ  (4,580)âÂ  (5,605)âââââââLoans originated for investment:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Mortgage loans:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Single-familyâÂ  92,498âÂ  40,920Multi-familyâÂ  25,115âÂ  22,112Commercial real estateâÂ  3,777âÂ  9,757ConstructionâÂ  725âÂ  1,480Commercial business loansââ 550ââ 1,250Total loans originated for investmentâÂ  122,665âÂ  75,519âââââââLoan principal repaymentsâÂ  (133,314)âÂ  (99,915)Increase (decrease) in other items, net (1)âÂ  3,415âÂ  (254)Net decrease in loans held for investmentâ$ (7,234)â$ (24,650)â(1)Includes net changes in undisbursed loan funds, deferred loan fees or costs, ACL, fair value of loans held for investment and advance payments of escrows.ââ11
Table of ContentsLoan ServicingâThe Bank receives fees from a variety of investors in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual loan payments on loans sold by the Bank to such investors. At June 30, 2025, the Bank was servicing $34.4 million of loans for others, slightly lower than the $34.6 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to scheduled principal payments and prepayments, partly offset by new loans sold with servicing retained. Loan servicing includes processing payments, accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes, hazard insurance and other loan-related items such as private mortgage insurance. After the Bank receives the gross mortgage payment from individual borrowers, it remits to the investor a predetermined net amount based on the loan sale agreement for that mortgage.âServicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated net future cash flows consistent with contractually specified servicing fees. The Bank periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment, which is measured as the excess of cost over fair value. This review is performed on a disaggregated basis, based on loan type and interest rate. Generally, loan servicing becomes more valuable when interest rates rise (as prepayments typically decrease) and less valuable when interest rates decline (as prepayments typically increase). In estimating fair values at June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank used a weighted average Constant Prepayment Rate (âCPRâ) of 10.58% and 9.59%, and a weighted average discount rate of 9.04% and 9.06%, respectively.Â The required impairment reserve against servicing assets at June 30, 2025 and 2024 was $151,000 and $170,000, respectively.Â In aggregate, servicing assets had a carrying value of $282,000 and a fair value of $131,000 at June 30, 2025, compared to a carrying value of $272,000 and a fair value of $102,000 at June 30, 2024.âAsset QualityâDelinquent Loans. When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank initiates collection procedures. In most cases, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if the loan remains delinquent on the 120th day for single-family loans or the 90th day for other loans, or sooner if the borrower is chronically delinquent, and after all reasonable means of obtaining the payment have been exhausted, foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law, are initiated. Interest income is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on such loans.âAs of June 30, 2025, total non-performing assets, net of the ACL and fair value adjustments, were $1.4 million, or 0.11% of total assets, which was comprised of seven single-family loans and one multi-family loan.Â As of June 30, 2025, $1.2 million or 86% of the total non-performing loans had a current payment status. As of June 30, 2025, there was one non-performing single-family loan of $198,000 that was in foreclosure process. In comparison, as of June 30, 2024, total non-performing assets, net of the ACL and fair value adjustments, were $2.6 million, or 0.20% of total assets, consisting of 10 single-family loans, of which $1.1 million, or 43%, had a current payment status. As of June 30, 2024, Â there were no non-performing loans in foreclosure process. The Bank had no real estate owned (âREOâ) at June 30, 2025 and 2024.â12

Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, collateral value, the financial condition of the borrower and/or guarantor and current economic conditions. The Bank measures each non-performing loan based on Accounting Standards Codification (âASCâ) 326, âFinancial Instruments â Credit Losses,â establishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance, and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible.âModified Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. We occasionally modify loans to alleviate temporary difficulties in the borrowerâs financial condition and/or constraints on the borrowerâs ability to repay the loan, and to minimize our potential losses. We refer to these modifications as modified loans to troubled borrowers. Modifications may include changes in the amortization terms of the loan, reductions in interest rates, acceptance of interest only payments, and, in very limited cases, reductions to the outstanding loan balance. Such loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when there is doubt concerning the full repayment of principal and interest, when the loan is past due for a 120 days for single-family loans or 90 days for other loans, or sooner if other indicators of credit deterioration occur, such as issuance of a notice of default or chronic borrower delinquency. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all contractual amounts past due have been brought current, and the borrowerâs performance under the modified loan terms, as well as the ultimate collectability of all contractual amounts due, is no longer in doubt. âIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2022-02, âFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.â This ASU provides new guidance on the treatment of troubled debt restructurings (âTDRâ) in relation to the adoption of the current expected credit loss methodology, or CECL model, for the accounting for credit losses (discussed below). Previous accounting guidance related to TDRs is eliminated and new disclosure requirements are adopted in regards to loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties under the assumption that the CECL model will capture credit losses related to TDRs. The required disclosures regarding gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination and loan modifications are presented under Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326, the Bank no longer reports TDRs or classifies loans as TDRs given those loans 13
Table of Contentspreviously recognized as TDRs have been incorporated into the CECL methodology in regard to credit loss reserves as of July 1, 2023. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties at both dates. âForeclosed Real Estate. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as REO until it is sold. When a property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less the estimated cost of sale. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. As of both June 30, 2025 and 2024, there was no REO property.Â In managing the real estate owned properties for quick disposition, the Bank completes the necessary repairs and maintenance to the individual properties before listing for sale, obtains new appraisals and broker price opinions (âBPOâ) to determine current market listing prices, and engages local realtors who are most familiar with real estate sub-markets, among other techniques, which generally results in the quick disposition of real estate owned.âAsset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding the problem assets of savings institutions. The regulations require that each institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of institutions, OCC examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the institution establishes an individually evaluated allowance and may subsequently charge-off the amount of the asset classified as loss. A portion of the ACL established to cover probable losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institutionâs regulatory capital. Assets that do not currently expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and are closely monitored by the Bank.â14

In determining whether the Bankâs assets expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification, the Bank may consider various factors, including the payment history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio, the reserves of the borrower and guarantors, and the debt coverage ratio of the property securing the loan, among other factors. After consideration of these and other factors, the Bank may determine that the asset in question, though not currently delinquent, presents a risk of loss that requires it to be classified or designated as special mention. In addition, the Bankâs loans held for investment may include single-family, commercial and multi-family real estate loans with a balance exceeding the current market value of the collateral which are not classified because they are performing and have borrowers and/or guarantor who have sufficient resources to support the repayment of the loan.âThe Bank has established a formal methodology for determining the provision for credit losses. The methodology is set forth in a written policy and considers the need for a collectively evaluated allowance for groups of homogeneous loans and an individually evaluated allowance for problem loans. The Bankâs methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the ACL consists of several key elements.âThe Bank maintains an allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment in accordance with ASC 326. The allowance is determined using historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, and is reviewed and adjusted quarterly by management. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually, and non-performing loans are charged off when the estimated collectability of principal and interest is in doubt. Management also considers qualitative factors, including changes in lending practices, collateral values, concentrations of credit, and current economic conditions, when assessing the adequacy of the allowance. Management believes the allowance is sufficient to absorb expected losses on the loan portfolio. For additional information regarding the Bankâs allowance for credit losses, the methodology used to estimate expected credit losses, and the composition of non-performing loans, see Note 3 â Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements.15

Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest a portion of their assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities.Â âThe investment policy of the Bank, established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Bankâs Asset-Liability Committee, seeks to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, complement the Bankâs lending activities, and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk or credit risk. Investments are made based on certain considerations, such as credit quality, yield, maturity, liquidity and marketability. The Bank also considers the effect that the proposed investment would have on the Bankâs risk-based capital requirements and interest rate risk sensitivity.âAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bankâs investment securities portfolio was $111.0 million and $131.9 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of federal agency and GSE obligations. During fiscal 2025, the Bank purchased one investment security for $981,000; while during 2024, the Bank did not purchase any investment securities. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bankâs securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States government or its agencies or a GSE.â17

This compares to June 30, 2024, when the Bank reported $15.8 million of unrealized holding losses, all of which were in a loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses on investment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities, which are predominately GSE securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating nature of interest rates, and not related to any potential credit risks within the investment portfolio. The Bank does not currently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale and as such, records the investment security at book value or fair market value as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP."). As a part of the Bankâs monthly risk assessment, it runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized costs basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Bankâs assessment that it has the ability to hold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs is realized and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized costs. There was no ACL on investment securities held to maturity and there was no impairment on investment securities available for sale at June 30, 2025 and 2024.âAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment securities available for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until maturity. As previously discussed, it also determined that it was more likely than not that the Bank would not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis; therefore, no impairment losses were recorded on investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.ââDeposit Activities and Other Sources of FundsâGeneral. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bankâs funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced significantly by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings through the FHLB â San Francisco, Federal Reserve Bank (âFRBâ) of San Francisco and the correspondent bank may be used to mitigate the declines in the availability of funds from other sources.19
Table of ContentsâDeposit Accounts. Many of the Bankâs depositors are residents of the State of California. Deposits are attracted from within the Bankâs market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market and time deposit accounts.Â Deposit account terms vary, differentiated by the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current interest rates, profitability to the Bank, interest rate risk characteristics, competition and its customersâ preferences and concerns. Generally, the Bankâs deposit rates are commensurate with the median rates of its competitors within a given market. The Bank may occasionally pay above-market interest rates to attract or retain deposits when less expensive sources of funds are not available.Â The Bank may also pay above-market interest rates in specific markets in order to increase the deposit base of a particular office or group of offices. The Bank reviews its deposit composition and pricing on a weekly basis.âThe Bank generally offers time deposits for terms not exceeding seven years.Â As illustrated in the following table, time deposits represented approximately 35% of the Bankâs deposit portfolio at June 30, 2025, compared to approximately 31% at June 30, 2024.Â The time deposits included $131.0 million and $131.8 million of brokered certificates of deposit at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.Â At June 30, 2025, the Bank had related party deposits of approximately $8.0 million, compared to $6.3 million at June 30, 2024.

As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB â San Francisco and is authorized to apply for advances using such stock and certain of its mortgage loans and other assets (principally investment securities) as collateral, provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate, maturity, terms and conditions. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB â San Francisco as an alternative to deposits to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to help manage interest rate risk. The FHLB â San Francisco has served as the Bankâs primary borrowing source. âAs of June 30, 2025, the FHLB â San Francisco borrowing capacity was limited to 40% of the Bankâs total assets, amounting to $504.1 million, as compared to $516.0 million at June 30, 2024.Â Advances from the FHLB â San Francisco are typically secured by the Bankâs single-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans. Total mortgage loans pledged to the FHLB â San Francisco were $734.4 million at June 30, 2025 and $774.1 million at June 30, 2024.Â In addition, the Bank pledged investment securities totaling $4.7 million and $3.9 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, to collateralize its FHLB â San Francisco advances under the Securities-Backed Credit (âSBCâ) facility.Â At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had $213.0 million and $238.5 million of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB â San Francisco with a weighted average interest rate of 4.59% and 4.88%, respectively. At June 30, 2025, the outstanding borrowings mature between 2025 and 2028 with a weighted average maturity of 10 months. âIn addition to the borrowings mentioned above, the Bank utilized its borrowing facility for letters of credit and credit enhancement for loans previously sold to the FHLB â San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance (âMPFâ) program which have a recourse liability. The letters of credit are used to collateralize the local agency deposits. The outstanding letters of credit were $8.5 million and $16.0 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024; while the outstanding MPF credit enhancement was $216,000 at both June 30, 2025 and 2024.Â  As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the remaining financing availability through the FHLB â San Francisco was $282.3 million and $261.3 million, with remaining available collateral of $364.9 million and $367.4 million, respectively. âAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank also had secured a discount window facility of $142.5 million and $208.6 million at the FRB of San Francisco, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank deposited $24.8 million of investment securities and $227.0 million of loans held for investment as collateral, compared to a total of $126.6 million of investment securities and $178.6 million of loans held for investment deposited as collateral under the discount window facility at June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility at both dates.âAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank also maintained a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million, maturing on March 31, 2026 and June 30, 2025, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at either date.âAs a member of the FHLB â San Francisco, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB â San Francisco stock. The Bank held the required investment in stock at June 30, 2025 and 2024 of $9.6 million with no excess investment at both dates.âDuring fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank purchased FHLB â San Francisco capital stock totaling $0 and $63,000, respectively, and did not redeem any of the capital stock during both periods. In fiscal 2025 and 2024, the FHLB â San Francisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling $835,000 and $793,000, respectively.ââSubsidiary ActivitiesâFederal savings institutions generally may invest up to 3% of their assets in service corporations, provided that at least one-half of any amount in excess of 1% is used primarily for community, inner-city and community development projects. The Bankâs investment in its service corporations did not exceed these limits at June 30, 2025 and 2024.â23
Table of ContentsThe Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries: PFC, Profed Mortgage, Inc., and First Service Corporation. PFCâs current activities include: (i) acting as trustee for the Bankâs real estate transactions and (ii) holding real estate for investment, if any. Profed Mortgage, Inc and First Service Corporation are currently inactive. In fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank contributed capital of $10,000 and $0 to PFC, respectively. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bankâs investment in all its combined subsidiaries totaled $14,000 and $8,000, respectively.ââREGULATIONâThe following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Corporation and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress (âCongressâ) that may affect the Corporationâs and the Bankâs operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Corporation and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, FDIC, FRB and SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the Corporation and the Bank. The Bank cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.âGeneralâThe Bank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits. The Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws, which must be complied with by the Bank. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate the Bankâs safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements.Â This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for credit losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FRB, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and the Bank and their operations. The Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB, its primary regulator. The Corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. For additional information, see âSavings and Loan Holding Company Regulationsâ below in this Form 10-K.âSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Corporation. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Corporation.âFederal Regulation of Savings InstitutionsâOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federal savings institutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all federal savings institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law.âAll federal savings institutions must pay assessments to the OCC, to fund the agencyâs operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institutionâs total assets, including 24
Table of Contentsconsolidated subsidiaries. The Bankâs OCC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were $167,000 and $179,000, respectively.âThe Bankâs general permissible lending limit for loans to one borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus).Â The Bankâs limit on loans to one borrower, or group of related borrowers, at June 30, 2025 and 2024 was $19.7 million and $20.1 million, respectively. At June 30, 2025, the Bankâs largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of related borrowers consisted of four multi-family loans totaling $4.9 million, which were performing according to their original payment terms.âEffective July 1, 2019, the OCC issued a final rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (âEGRRCPAâ) which permits an eligible federal savings bank with assets of $20.0 billion or less as of December 31, 2017 to elect to operate with the business powers of a national bank, generally subject to the same limitations and restrictions, without converting to a national bank charter. A federal savings bank that makes the so-called âcovered savings associationâ election must divest any activities or investments that are not permitted for a national bank. The Bank had not made such an election as of June 30, 2025.âFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB â San Francisco, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs,Â each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB - San Francisco is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB - San Francisco. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had $213.0 million and $238.5 million of outstanding advances, respectively, from the FHLB â San Francisco with a remaining available credit facility of $282.3 million and $261.3 million, respectively, based on 40% of total assets for both dates, which is limited to available collateral. For additional information, see âBusiness â Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds â Borrowingsâ above in this Form 10-K.âAs a member of the FHLB - San Francisco, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB â San Francisco. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank held $9.6 million of FHLB - San Francisco stock at both dates which were in compliance with this membership requirement. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank was required to purchase $0 and $63,000 of FHLB â San Francisco stock, respectively, and the Bank did not redeem any capital stock during both periods.Â In fiscal 2025 and 2024, the FHLB â San Francisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling $835,000 and $793,000, respectively. There is no guarantee in the future that the FHLB â San Francisco will pay cash dividends or redeem excess stock held by its members.âUnder federal law, the FHLB - San Francisco is required to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. These contributions have in the past adversely affected the level of dividends paid by the FHLB - San Francisco and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB - San Francisco stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bankâs FHLB - San Francisco stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bankâs capital.âInsurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Deposit Insurance Fund (âDIFâ) of the FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per account owner as defined by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. As an insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums in the form of assessments to maintain the DIF and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase its initial base insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points to improve the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF would be restored to at least 1.35% by September 30, 2028. The Bankâs FDIC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were $573,000 and $601,000, respectively.âUnder the FDICâs risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less likely to fail pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion in assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institutionâs failure within three years.â25
Table of ContentsThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.âInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of the Bankâs deposit insurance.âQualified Thrift Lender Test. Like all savings institutions (subject to a narrow exception not applicable to the Bank), the Bank is required to meet a qualified thrift lender (âQTLâ) test to avoid certain restrictions on its operations. This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets, as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. As an alternative, a savings institution may maintain 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (âCodeâ), as amended. Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments.âAny savings institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter, and a savings and loan holding company of such an institution may become regulated as a bank holding company. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank maintained 93.0% and 92.3% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments, respectively, and therefore met the qualified thrift lender test at both dates. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank was in compliance with the QTL test as of each month end.âCapital Requirements.Â Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, including a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets leverage ratio, a common equity Tier 1 (âCET1â) to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio and a total capital to risk-based assets ratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, (ii) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (iii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; and (iv) a total capital ratio of 8%.âMortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are also deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities and interest-only strips. Because of the Bankâs asset size, the Bank was given a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities and interest-only strips in its capital calculations. The Bank elected to exercise this option to opt-out in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels.âThe Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.âIn order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Bank must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and the Bank must not be subject to certain mandates by the OCC requiring it as an individual institution to meet any specified capital level. âEGRRCPA required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a âcommunity bank leverage ratioâ of between 8% and 10% for institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion. Institutions with a capital level at or exceeding the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements, and electing the alternative framework, are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. Final rules issued by the agencies established the community bank leverage ratio at 9% of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in or out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly Call Report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Corporation did not opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework for the year ended June 30, 2025.â26
Table of ContentsThe FASB has issued a new accounting standard, ASC 326, for U.S. GAAP that was adopted by the Corporation on July 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss or CECL requires all entities holding financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the previous method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators (the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. The Bank elected to recognize the full $824,000 adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of CECL on July 1, 2023, instead of over the permitted three-year phase-in option.Prompt Corrective Action. An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it meets the minimum capital ratios described above. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is "critically undercapitalized." OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." Numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. In addition, âsignificantly undercapitalizedâ and âcritically undercapitalizedâ institutions are subject to even more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also may take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.âAs of June 30, 2025, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as âwell capitalizedâ under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âLimitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions and on their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, without regulatory approval. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or in troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the FRB.Â The FRB or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Further restrictions on Bankâs dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation will be limited, which may limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders.âActivities of Savings Associations and Their Subsidiaries. When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the savings institution controls, the savings institution must file a notice or application with the OCC and in certain circumstances with the FDIC and receive regulatory approval or non-objection.Â Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders. With respect to subsidiaries generally, the OCC may determine that investment by a savings institution in, or the activities of, a subsidiary must be restricted or eliminated based on safety and soundness or legal reasons.âTransactions with Affiliates. The Bankâs authority to engage in transactions with âaffiliatesâ is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the FRBâs Regulation W. The term âaffiliatesâ for these purposes generally mean any company that controls or is under common control with an institution except subsidiaries of the institution. The Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions 27
Table of Contentswith affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institutionâs capital. Institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.Â FDIC-insured institutions are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.âCommunity Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (âCRAâ), every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.Â The CRA requires that the OCC assess the Bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, especially low and moderate income neighborhoods. The current CRA evaluation system focuses on three tests: (1) a lending test, to evaluate the institution's record of making loans in its assessment areas; (2) an investment test, to evaluate the institution's record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low income or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (3) a service test, to evaluate the institution's delivery of banking services through its branches, ATM centers and other offices. Â Institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The Bank received a rating of satisfactory when it was last examined for CRA compliance. In 2023, federal banking regulators adopted a final rule to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (âCRAâ). However, in response to legal challenges, including an injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, the federal banking regulators announced in March 2025 their intention to rescind the final rule and reinstate the prior CRA framework. As a result, the Bank does not expect any material impact or significant changes to its operations or compliance obligations. âAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) was signed into law on October 26, 2001. The USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasuryâs Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts, and the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding companyâs effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.âRegulatory and Criminal Enforcement Provisions. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all âinstitution-affiliated parties,â including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease-and-desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can be nearly $2.0 million per day per violation in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.âStandards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.âFederal Reserve System. The FRB requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional 28
Table of ContentsFRB. Interest-bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a bank. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0%, which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.âEnvironmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (âCERCLAâ), is a federal statute, that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this âsecured creditor exemptionâ has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan.âTo the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potentially hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.âPrivacy and Cybersecurity Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customerâs ânon-public personal information,â to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to âopt-outâ of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA"), which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for data security breaches, thereby increasing potential liability associated with a data breach, which has triggered a number of class actions against other companies since January 1, 2020. Although the Bank may enjoy several fairly broad exemptions from the CCPA's privacy requirements, those exemptions do not extend to the private right of action for a data security breach. The CCPA, including any amendments thereto or final regulations implemented thereunder, as well as other similar state data privacy laws and regulations, may require the establishment by the Bank of certain regulatory compliance and risk management controls. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a âcomputer-security incidentâ rising to the level of a ânotification incidentâ has occurred. Â Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organizationâs operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Â Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organizationâs customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the new rule was required by May 1, 2022. Â âIn July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience and to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. The new rules require registrants to disclose on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material and to describe the material aspects of the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the registrant. The Corporation provided disclosures on its cybersecurity risk management and governance on this Form 10-K for fiscal year ended June 20, 2025 (See Part I, Item 1C - Cybersecurity).Non-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.â29
Table of ContentsOther Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (âCFPBâ) exercises broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10.0 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the OCC with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.âThe Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers.Â While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing.Â These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services.Â Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights.âSavings and Loan Holding Company RegulationâGeneral. The Corporation is a unitary savings and loan holding company, subject to the regulatory oversight of the FRB. Accordingly, the Corporation is required to register and file reports with the FRB and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the Bank. The FRB has promulgated regulations implementing the âsource of strengthâ doctrine that require holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. These and other FRB policies, as well as the capital conservation buffer may restrict the Corporationâs ability to pay dividends.âCapital Requirements. For a savings and loan holding company with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets that qualifies as a small bank holding company under the FRBâs Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, such as the Corporation, the capital regulations apply to its savings institution subsidiaries, but not the Corporation, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases. For a description of the capital regulations, see âFederal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirementsâ above.âActivities Restrictions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (âGLBAâ) provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA also specifies, subject to a grandfather provision, that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Corporation qualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Corporation of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Corporation would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to those activities permitted by FRB regulation. Multiple savings and loan holding companies may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, and certain other activities including acting as a trustee under a deed of trust and real estate investments.âIf the Bank were to fail the QTL test, the Corporation must, within one year of that failure, register as, and become subject to the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies. For additional information, see âFederal Regulation of Savings Institutions â Qualified Thrift Lender Testâ in this Form 10-K.âMergers and Acquisitions. The Corporation must obtain approval from the FRB before acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Corporation to acquire control of a savings institution, the FRB would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the 30
Table of ContentsCorporation and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community, including performance under the CRA and competitive factors.âThe FRB may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) supervisory acquisitions and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.âAcquisition of the Corporation. Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a âsavings and loan holding companyâ subject to registration, examination and regulation by the FRB and must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control or more than 5% of a class of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term âcompanyâ includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities. âControlâ of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly of more than 25% of any class of the savings associationâs voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding in certain cases 10% or more of a class of voting securities. Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more other persons. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain FRB approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act.âAccordingly, the prior approval of the FRB would be required:ââbefore any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common stock of the Corporation; andâbefore any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Corporation, and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock.âIn addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the FRB in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association.âFederal Securities Laws. Provident Financial Holdings, Inc.âs common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (âExchange Actâ). The Corporation is subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.âDividends and Stock Repurchases. The FRBâs policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and loan holding companies expresses its view that a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the companyâs net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the companyâs capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.âIn addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. As discussed above, the capital conservation buffer requirements may also limit or preclude dividends payable by the Corporation.31
Table of ContentsTAXATIONâFederal TaxationâGeneral. The Corporation reports its income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bankâs reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Corporation.âTax Bad Debt Reserves. As a result of legislation enacted in 1996, the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves was repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. Due to such repeal, the Bank is no longer able to calculate its deduction for bad debts using the percentage-of-taxable-income or the experience method. Instead, the Bank is permitted to deduct as bad debt expense its specific charge-offs during the taxable year. In addition, the legislation required savings institutions to recapture into taxable income, over a six-year period, their post 1987 additions to their bad debt tax reserves. As of the effective date of the legislation, the Bank had no post 1987 additions to its bad debt tax reserves. As of June 30, 2025, the Bankâs total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes was approximately $9.0 million. Under current law, a savings institution will not be required to recapture its pre-1988 bad debt reserve unless the Bank makes a ânon-dividend distributionâ as defined below. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes.âDistributions. In the event that the Bank makes ânon-dividend distributionsâ to Provident that are considered as made from the reserve for losses on qualifying real estate property loans, to the extent the reserve for such losses exceeds the amount that would have been allowed under the experience method or from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans (âExcess Distributionsâ), then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bankâs taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bankâs current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bankâs current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bankâs bad debt reserve. Thus, any dividends to Provident that would reduce amounts appropriated to the Bankâs bad debt reserve and deducted for federal income tax purposes would create a tax liability for the Bank. The amount of additional taxable income attributable to an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a ânon-dividend distribution,â then approximately one and one-half times the amount distributed will be included in taxable income for federal income tax purposes. For additional information, see "Regulation - Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Limitations on Capital Distributionsâ in this Form 10-K for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve. During fiscal 2025, the Bank declared and paid $9.0 million of cash dividends to Provident, while Provident declared and paid $3.8 million of cash dividends to shareholders.âExcise Tax on Stock Repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a one percent excise tax on the value of corporate share repurchases (net of issuance). On June 28, 2024, the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Services issued the final regulation that provide guidance on how to report and pay the excise tax on stock repurchases. The excise tax is a non-deductible tax of one percent of the fair market value of the Corporationâs stock repurchases, net of restricted stock distributions, stock option exercises, ESOP repurchases and contributions and other qualified activities, occurring after December 31, 2022 in excess of $1.0 million. The excise tax on the stock repurchases in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was $43,000 and $26,000, respectively. Â  âTax Effect from Stock-Based Compensation. During fiscal 2025, 23,825 shares of restricted common stock vested and were distributed to employees. No non-qualified stock options were exercised, and no incentive stock options exercised as disqualifying dispositions. During the fiscal year, 197,168 shares of non-qualified stock options expired or forfeited, and 25,675 shares of restricted stock were forfeited. âOther Matters.Â The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bankâs income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporationâs income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporationâs income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal years thereafter remain subject to 32
Table of Contentsfederal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal 2022 and fiscal years thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities. On April 7, 2025, the California Francise Tax Board sent a tax examination letter for fiscal 2021 and 2022, and as of June 30, 2025, all of the requested documents have been provided.âState TaxationâCalifornia. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the Bank equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally, plus an âin lieuâ rate of 2%, which is approximately equal to personal property taxes and business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the Corporation). At June 30, 2025, the Corporationâs net state tax rate was 8.6%. Bad debt deductions are available in computing California franchise taxes using the specific charge-off method. The Bank and its California subsidiaries file California franchise tax returns on a combined basis. The Corporation will be treated as a general corporation subject to the general corporate tax rate. âDelaware. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Corporation is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax, but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.Â During fiscal 2025, the Corporation paid franchise taxes of $200,000.ââEmployees and Human CapitalâAs of June 30, 2025, the Bank had 163 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 95 full-time, 90 prime-time and no part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and management believes that its relationship with employees is good.âTo facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make the Bank an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by market-based compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. At June 30, 2025, approximately 69.8% of our workforce was female and 30.2% male, and our average employee tenure was approximately 8.5 years, up slightly from an average employee tenure of 8.3 years at June 30, 2024. The ethnicity of our workforce was 36.5% White, 44.8% Hispanic or Latino, 7.8% African American or Black, 5.2% Asian, 3.6% two or more races, 0.5% American Indian or Alaskan Native and 1.6% Not Specified. As part of our compensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market competitive compensation programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to strong base wages, additional programs include quarterly or annual bonus opportunities, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, a Corporation-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, accrued vacation and sick time, family leave, and an employee assistance program. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. In support of our commitment, we provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status; and that offer choice, where possible, so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. A core value of our talent management approach is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and dedication in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our commitment to our communities, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our average employee tenure of over eight years reflects the engagement of our employees in this talent management philosophy. Turnover for employees, as measured by terminated employees to the average total employees, was 24.3% in fiscal 2025, up slightly from 23.3% in fiscal 2024.âââ33

Risk FactorsâWe assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business. In addition to the risk factors described below, other risks and uncertainties not specifically mentioned, or that are currently known to, or deemed by, management to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and/or cash flows. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. If any of the circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur, the value of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.âRisks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsâOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which we depend.âAs of June 30, 2025, approximately 64% of our real estate loans were secured by collateral and made to borrowers located in Southern California, with the balance located predominantly throughout the rest of California. Accordingly, our financial performance is closely tied to economic conditions in these areas. A downturn in local or regional economic conditions, as a result of inflation, rising interest rates, unemployment, recessions, natural disasters, or other adverse events, could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.âChanges in U.S. immigration policies, particularly those that could lead to mass deportations, may disrupt key industries in our region such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. These disruptions could exacerbate labor shortages, reduce productivity, and cause financial instability among affected businesses, impairing the repayment abilities of borrowers in these sectors.âGlobal geopolitical tensions, including international conflicts, sanctions, trade disputes, and tariffs, could further disrupt manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation in our markets, leading to higher costs, reduced investment, supply chain delays, and lower credit demand. Such instability may also increase cybersecurity threats, including those from state-sponsored actors, heightening operational and reputational risk.âA deterioration in economic conditions in our market areas could result in:ââhigher loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures;âan increase in our ACL;âthe slowing of sales of foreclosed assets;âa decline in demand for our products and services;âa decline in the value of collateral for loans may in turn reduce customers' borrowing power, and the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;âthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; andâa decrease in the amount of our low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits.âBecause our loan portfolio is more geographically concentrated than those of larger financial institutions, adverse changes in Californiaâs economy, including those tied to immigration policy shifts, may have a greater impact on our earnings and capital. Any deterioration in real estate markets could significantly affect borrowersâ repayment capabilities and collateral values. Real estate values are influenced by a range of factors, including economic conditions, regulatory changes, natural disasters (such as fires, droughts, earthquakes, and flooding), and trade-related issues affecting construction costs and 35
Table of Contentsmaterial availability. If we must liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.âMonetary policy, inflation, deflation, and other external economic factors could adversely impact our financial performance and operations.Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the FRB. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the FRB, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. Higher U.S. tariffs on imported goods could exacerbate inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of goods and materials for businesses and consumers. This may particularly affect small to medium-sized businesses, as they are less able to leverage economies of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, our business customers may experience increased financial strain, reducing their ability to repay loans and adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to us to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and as a result, interest rates tend to have a more significant impact on our performance than general levels of inflation or deflation. However, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services, creating additional uncertainty in the economic environment.Risks Related to our Lending ActivitiesâOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.âAt June 30, 2025, $544.4 million, or 52% of our loans held for investment, were secured by single-family residential real property.Â This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Jumbo single-family loans which do not conform to secondary market mortgage requirements for our market areas are not immediately saleable in the secondary market and may expose us to increased risk because of their larger balances. Higher market interest rates, recessionary conditions or declines in the volume of single-family real estate sales and/or the sales prices as well as elevated unemployment rates, may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial condition and business operations.âA few of our legacy residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated a first mortgage with an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a concurrent second mortgage for a combined loan-to-value ratio of up to 100% or because of a decline in home values in our market areas. Residential loans with high loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses.âOur multi-family and commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.âWe originate multi-family and commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by residential and non-residential properties. At June 30, 2025, we had $496.2 million or 48% of total loans held for investment in multi-family and commercial real estate loans. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a single-family residential loan. Repayment on these loans typically is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower's project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by single-family residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as single-family residential real estate. In addition, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon 36
Table of Contentspayments upon maturity, which would require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property to make the balloon payment at maturity, thus increasing the risk of default or non-payment. âA secondary market for many types of multi-family and commercial real estate loans is not readily liquid, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we foreclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a single-family residential mortgage loan because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs on multi-family and commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred within the single-family residential loan portfolio.âWe occasionally purchase loans in bulk or âpools.â We may experience lower yields or losses on loan âpoolsâ because the assumptions we use when purchasing loans in bulk may not prove correct.âIn order to achieve our loan growth objectives and/or improve earnings, we may purchase loans, either individually, through participations, or in bulk. We did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2025 and 2024. When we determine the purchase price we are willing to pay to purchase loans in bulk, management makes certain assumptions about, among other things, how fast borrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market, our ability to collect on loans successfully and, if necessary, our ability to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. In addition, when we purchase loans, we perform certain due diligence procedures and typically require customary limited indemnities. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change, the purchase price paid for âpoolsâ of loans may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For example, if we purchase pools of loans at a premium and some of the loans are prepaid before we modeled, we will earn less interest income on the purchase than expected. Our success in growing our loan portfolio through purchases of loan âpoolsâ depends on our ability to price loan âpoolsâ properly and on the general economic conditions within the geographic areas where the underlying properties of the purchased loans are located.âAcquiring loans through bulk purchases may involve acquiring loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may not have substantial prior experience. We may be exposed to a greater risk of loss to the extent that bulk purchases contain such loans.âOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.âOur business relies significantly on the creditworthiness of our customers. To account for potential defaults and nonperformance in our loan portfolio, we maintain an ACL on loans using the CECL methodology. This allowance represents management's best estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:âour collective allowance, for loans evaluated on a pool basis with similar risk characteristics based on our and peer life of loan historical loss experience, certain qualitative factors consisting of macroeconomic conditions and external factors as regulatory requirements, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relating to managementâs expectations of future events; andâour individual allowance, for evaluation of individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics based on the present value of the expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral, less selling costs.âThe determination of the appropriate ACL involves a significant degree of subjectivity, relying on substantial estimates of both current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to potential material changes. Inaccuracies in our estimations could lead to an insufficient ACL, necessitating increases through provisions for credit losses, adversely impacting our recorded net income. Â âIncluded in our single-family residential loan portfolio, which comprised 52% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2025, were $16.9 million or 2% of total loans held for investment that were non-traditional single-family loans, which include negative amortization and more than 30-year amortization loans, stated income loans and low FICO score loans, all of which have a higher risk of default and loss than conforming residential mortgage loans. Additionally, as we acknowledge the potential impact of significant portfolio growth, new loan products, and refinancing activities, these actions may result in portfolios consisting of unseasoned loans that may not perform as anticipated, elevating the risk of an inadequate 37
Table of Contentsallowance to absorb losses without additional provisions. A material decrease in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, significant changes in the risk profile of markets, industries, or customer groups, or inadequacy in the ACL could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations.âWildfires in California, including those that began in January 2025 and more recent events in other regions of the state, present ongoing risks to our loan portfolio. Borrowers in affected areas may experience financial hardship, which could increase loan defaults, reduce repayment capacity, and impair collateral values. Inadequate insurance coverage or denied claims may further limit recovery efforts. In addition, local economic disruptions, such as business closures and job losses, may adversely affect borrowersâ ability to meet financial obligations. Given the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires associated with climate change, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses. While we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover actual losses resulting from wildfire-related events.âBank regulatory agencies also periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Â âIf charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we may need additional provisions to increase the ACL. Â Any increases in the ACL will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital.âNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.âNon-performing assets, consisting of non-performing loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure, adversely affect our earnings in various ways. We reverse accrued interest on non-performing loans and do not record interest income on foreclosed assets. Additionally, non-performing loans increase our loan administration costs, including increased costs related to the improvement, maintenance and repairs of the foreclosed assets. Upon foreclosure or similar proceedings, we record the repossessed asset at the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, which may result in a write-down or loss. A significant increase in the level of non-performing assets from current levels would also increase our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the increased risk profile. While we attempt to reduce problem assets through various means such as collection efforts, asset sales, workouts and modifications, a decline in the value of the underlying collateral or in the borrowerâs performance or financial condition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets often requires a significant time commitment from management, diverting their attention from other aspects of our operations.âRisks Related to Market and Interest Rate ChangesâFluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability.âOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income, which is significantly affected by interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and policies set by governmental and regulatory bodies, particularly the FRB. Â Increases in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, weaken the housing market by reducing refinancing activity and home purchases, and negatively affect the broader U.S. economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or recessionary conditions.We principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.âA sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. As is the case with many financial institutions, we attempt to increase our proportion of deposits comprising either no or relatively low interest-bearing accounts, which has been challenging over the last couple of years. At June 30, 2025, we had $278.3 million in time deposits that mature within one year, $83.6 million in noninterest-bearing checking accounts and $492.9 million in interest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a 38
Table of Contentsrising interest rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings. âIn addition, most of our mortgage loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment.âChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our securities portfolio available for sale. Generally, the fair value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholdersâ equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholdersâ equity.âWhile we employ asset and liability management strategies to mitigate interest rate risk, unexpected, substantial, or prolonged rate changes could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our interest rate risk models and assumptions may not fully capture the impact of actual rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates on our loan portfolio, see Item 7A, âQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Riskâ of this Form 10-K.âCertain hedging strategies that we may use to manage investment in mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity.We may use derivative instruments to economically hedge mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments to offset changes in fair value resulting from changing interest rate environments. Our hedging strategies are susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. In addition, hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings.âWe may incur losses on our securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates.Factors beyond our control can significantly impact the fair value of securities within our portfolio, potentially leading to adverse changes in their value. These factors include, but are not limited to, actions taken by rating agencies regarding the securities, defaults by the issuer, adverse events affecting either the issuer or the underlying securities, and shifts in market interest rates along with continued instability in the capital markets. These influences could result in impairments that are not just temporary, leading to realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods. Such developments could also lead to declines in other comprehensive income, thereby potentially affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations in a significant manner. Â We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for expected credit losses based on ASC 326, âFinancial Instruments â Credit Losses,â since the adoption on July 1, 2023. The process usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Despite our efforts to evaluate these factors, there can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in credit losses on these assets. Â Such credit losses could lead to accounting charges that might materially impact our net income and capital levels.âRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance MattersâWe are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability. âOur business operations are significantly influenced by the extensive body of accounting regulations in the United States, which are subject to periodic updates and changes. Regulatory bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, periodically issue new guidance or alter existing accounting rules and reporting requirements, which can substantially impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements. These changes may require us to adopt new accounting standards, leading to potential adjustments in how we report our financial position, performance, and risk exposures. Additionally, such 39
Table of Contentsregulatory changes could necessitate retrospective application, which might result in the restatement of prior period financial statements.âOne such significant change in fiscal 2024 was the implementation of the CECL model, which we adopted on July 1, 2023. Â Under the CECL model, financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, are presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This forward-looking approach in estimating expected credit losses contrasts starkly with the prior, "incurred loss" model, which delays recognition until a loss is probable. CECL mandates considering historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts affecting collectability, leading to periodic adjustments of financial asset values. However, this forward-looking methodology, reliant on macroeconomic variables, introduces the potential for increased earnings volatility due to unexpected changes in these indicators between periods. An additional consequence of CECL is an accounting asymmetry between loan-related income, recognized periodically based on the effective interest method, and credit losses, recognized upfront at origination. This asymmetry might create the perception of reduced profitability during loan expansion periods due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Conversely, periods with stable or declining loan levels might seem relatively more profitable as income accrues gradually for loans where losses had been previously recognized.âNon-compliance with the USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions.âThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasuryâs Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Additionally, any perceived or actual failure to prevent money laundering or terrorist financing activities could significantly damage our reputation. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.âIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.âOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze, and control the types of risk to which we are subject to. These risks include, among others, liquidity, credit, market, interest rate, operational, legal and compliance, and reputational risk. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies, and procedures.Â While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances,Â or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as they may exist, or develop in the future, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.âClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect our business and results of operations.The effects of climate change continue to raise significant concerns about the state of the environment. However, under the current administration, federal policy has shifted to reduce emphasis on climate change initiatives and environmental regulations. This includes scaling back federal involvement in international agreements like the Paris Agreement and easing regulatory pressures on businesses, including banks, to address climate-related risks. Legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at combating climate change may face increased scrutiny or reduced priority under this administration.The lack of empirical data regarding the financial and credit risks posed by climate change still makes it difficult to predict its specific impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, the physical effects of climate change, 40
Table of Contentssuch as more frequent and severe weather disasters, could directly affect us. For instance, such events may damage real property securing loans in our portfolios or reduce the value of that collateral. If our borrowers' insurance is insufficient to cover these losses or if insurance becomes unavailable, the value of the collateral securing our loans could be negatively affected, potentially impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, climate change may adversely affect regional and local economic activity, harming our customers and the communities in which we operate. Regardless of changes in federal policy, the effects of climate change and their unknown long-term impacts could still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our litigation related costs may increase.âWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the Bank's business. Our involvement in litigation may increase significantly. The expenses of some legal proceedings will adversely affect our results of operations until they are resolved. Further, there can be no assurance that loan workouts and other activities will not expose us to additional legal actions, including lender liability or environmental claims. âRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and FraudâWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.âOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, fraudulent or unauthorized access, denial or degradation of service attacks, misuse, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.âFurther, our cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third party processing services. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third partyâs information systems or their payment processors. Such a data security breach could compromise our customerâs account information. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customersâ card accounts, as well as costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. We may also incur other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts or credit monitoring services. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs.âBreaches of information security may also occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems, our customersâ or counterpartiesâ confidential information, including employees. We are continuously working to install new, and upgrade our existing, information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around ransomware, phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to further protect the Corporation against cyber risks and security breaches.âThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats 41
Table of Contentsare increasingly a concern for companies, including ours. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft, debit and card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.âSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions. Any compromise of our security could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Although we have developed and continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could result in losses to us or our customers, our loss of business and/or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, our inability to grow our online services or other businesses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.âOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. While we select our third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher transaction volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches or if we otherwise have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delays and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. We cannot ensure that such breaches, failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches, system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.âOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.âWe are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customerâs information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.ââ42
Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business and Industry GenerallyâIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.âLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the California markets in which our loans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities on acceptable terms could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See âItem 7. Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations â Liquidity and Capital Resourcesâ of this Form 10-K.âWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.âWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide products and services necessary for our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. If a vendor fails to meet its contractual obligations due to changes in its organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, or any other reason, our operations could be disrupted, potentially causing a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if a vendor agreement is not renewed or is renewed on terms less favorable to us. Regulatory agencies also require financial institutions to remain accountable for all aspects of vendor performance, including activities delegated to third parties. Additionally, disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems supporting our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches involving networks, systems, or devices used by our customers to access our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines or penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or compensation costs, and increased compliance expenses. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.âManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.âThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.âOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be exceedingly high.âWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may dilute the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.43
Table of ContentsâThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete.âThe financial services market is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.âEarthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters in our primary market area may result in material losses because of damage to collateral properties and borrowers' inability to repay loans.âSince our geographic concentration is in California, we are subject to earthquakes, fires, mudslides, droughts and other natural disasters. A major earthquake or other natural disaster may disrupt our business operations for an indefinite period of time and could result in material losses, although we have not experienced any losses in many years as a result of earthquake damage or other natural disaster. Although we are in an earthquake prone area, we and other lenders in the market area may not require earthquake insurance as a condition of making a loan. In addition to possibly sustaining damage to our own properties, if there is a major earthquake, fire, mudslide, or other natural disaster, we face the risk that many of our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.âAny breach of representations and warranties made by us to our loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales may require us to repurchase or substitute such loans we have sold.âWe have previously engaged in bulk loan sales pursuant to agreements that generally require us to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by us to the loan purchaser. Any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or, in some cases, upon any fraud or early payment default on such mortgage loans, may require us to repurchase or substitute loans. Any claims asserted against us in the future by one of our loan purchasers may result in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank did not repurchase any loans. Additionally, the Bank did not have any claims or settlements for previously sold loans during fiscal 2025 and 2024. âHaving net deferred tax asset or liability, the full value of which we may not be able to realize.âWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2025, the net deferred tax liability was approximately $832,000, as opposed to the net deferred tax asset of $606,000 at the prior fiscal year end. The net deferred tax asset or liability results primarily from (1) deferred loan costs, (2) provision for credit losses recorded for financial reporting purposes, which were in the past significantly larger than net loan charge-offs deducted for tax reporting purposes and (3) deferred compensation, among others.âWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income. We believe the recorded net deferred tax liability at June 30, 2025 is fully realizable based on our expected future earnings; however, expected future earnings may not be realized, which could impact the deductibility of our deferred tax assets.â44
Table of ContentsRegulatory changes to diversity, equity and inclusion (âDEIâ) and environmental, social and governance (âESGâ) practices could impact our reputation, compliance costs, and operations.In March 2025, the federal government issued an executive order titled âEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,â rescinding prior directives that promoted DEI initiatives, including Executive Order 11246 applicable to federal contractors. This order signals a shift in regulatory priorities, directing agencies to scrutinize DEI practices for consistency with federal nondiscrimination laws. The evolving regulatory environment may materially affect financial institutions, though the scope and enforcement approach remain uncertain.As a financial services provider, we face ongoing scrutiny from regulators, investors, and the public regarding ESG and DEI commitments. Changes in federal policy may prompt reassessment of our employment practices, vendor policies, training programs, and disclosures. Institutions engaged in government contracting or federal programs could face increased compliance risks. Any required changes to our DEI or ESG strategies, could increase operational complexity and legal exposure. Moreover, some states continue to enforce affirmative action or diversity reporting requirements, adding compliance challenges.Failure to adapt effectively to these shifting requirements could lead to reputational harm, regulatory investigations, litigation, or limitations on federal program participation. Conversely, reducing DEI commitments could negatively affect our reputation with investors, ratings agencies, employees, and communities. ESG ratings downgrades may also impact our cost of capital and access to funding. Given the unsettled regulatory landscape, we continuously monitor developments and strive to align our practices with legal obligations and stakeholder expectations. However, uncertainty remains, and misalignment could adversely affect our brand, employee morale, client relationships, and financial results.âWe rely on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level.âWe are an entity separate and distinct from our principal subsidiary, the Bank, and derive substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level in the form of dividends from that subsidiary. Accordingly, we are, and will continue to be, dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, to satisfy our other cash needs, to pay for share buybacks and to pay dividends on our common stock. The Bank's ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or conduct share buybacks. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. In fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank paid cash dividends to its holding company totaling $9.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively.ââItem 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsâNone.ââItem 1C.

The Corporation employs a variety of processes, risk assessments, and controls to assess, identify, and manage these risks. This includes estimating the likelihood and potential impact of cybersecurity incidents. To manage these risks, the Corporation designs, documents, and implements controls, which are then tested through compliance assessments and internal and external audits. In some cases, the Corporation also transfers risk, either wholly or partially, through insurance and other methods. When an incident occurs, the Corporation responds by remediating the incident while complying with regulatory obligations, and then evaluates the remediationâs effectiveness. Communication about risk management matters is conducted through documented policies and procedures, management and Board committee reporting, and employee training and communications. For a detailed description of how cybersecurity risks may materially affect the Corporationâs business strategy or results, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors.ââ45
Table of ContentsThe Corporationâs information technology risk management department consists of professionals with experience and expertise in cybersecurity, including specialists in identity and access management, cyber defense operations, security engineering, and information technology governance, risk, and compliance. This department is led by the Chief Information Officer (âCIOâ), who has a bachelor of science in information technology and many certifications such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Cloud Security Professional and Certified Information Privacy Professional, and the Information Security Officer (âISOâ), who has a bachelor of science in computer science and has over 19 years of experience in cybersecurity risk management. The ISO reports to the CIO, and the CIO reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the Corporation engages third-party experts as needed to assess, manage, and respond to cybersecurity risks through various methods, including risk assessments, IT audits based on different frameworks, penetration and vulnerability testing, social engineering, incident response, threat intelligence, education, and managed security services.âThe Corporation also monitors risks from third parties, such as service providers, through efforts like monitoring, information sharing, risk assessments, audits, contractual due diligence, and adherence to third-party security standards. Senior management governs risk management and is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and mediation of cybersecurity incidents. This is facilitated through working review committees, on which the ISO and/or CIO serve. These committees receive risk management reports appropriate to their scope of review, covering assessment results, risk ratings, and critical issues. They report significant matters to enterprise-wide risk committees, which oversee the broader scope of risk management for the enterprise. Through these efforts, senior management makes decisions and sets priorities for allocating resources to address risk management issues.âThe Corporationâs Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, oversees all risk management policies, procedures, and practices, including those related to cybersecurity. Senior management generally reports quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, to the Enterprise Risk Committee on technology risks, including those from cybersecurity threats. The Boardâs Audit Committee and the Board of Directors receive these reports as part of their risk management oversight responsibilities. Board members have direct access to senior management and other relevant personnel and may direct questions and request further information as needed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities.ââItem 2. PropertiesâAt June 30, 2025, the net book value of the Corporationâs properties (including land and buildings) and its furniture, fixtures and equipment was $9.3 million.Â The Corporationâs home office is located in Riverside, California. Including the home office, the Corporation has 13 retail banking offices, 12 of which are located in Riverside County in the cities of Riverside (5), Moreno Valley, Hemet, Sun City, Rancho Mirage, Corona, Temecula and Blythe. One office is located in Redlands, San Bernardino County, California.Â The Corporation owns six of the retail banking offices and has seven leased retail banking offices. The lease term maturity dates range from 2026 to 2029, some of which have remaining extension options. In the opinion of management, all properties are adequately covered by insurance, are in a good state of repair and are appropriately designed for their present and future use.ââItem 3. Legal ProceedingsâPeriodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the Corporationâs business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the Corporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. âThe Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.ââ46
Table of ContentsItem 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresâNot applicable.âPART IIâItem 5. Market for Registrantâs Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesâMarket Information and HoldersâThe common stock of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol âPROV.âÂ At August 18, 2025, there were 405 shareholders of record, and there were approximately 1,953 investors that hold stock in nominee or âstreet nameâ accounts with brokers.âDividendsâThe Corporationâs cash dividend payout policy is reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has declared quarterly cash dividends on the Corporationâs common stock for consecutive quarters since September 30, 2002. Future declarations or payments of dividends will be subject to the consideration of the Corporationâs Board of Directors, which will take into account the Corporationâs financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, legal restrictions, economic conditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared. No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods. Â Dividends on common stock from Provident depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is Providentâs predominant source of income. Managementâs projections show an expectation that cash dividends will continue for the foreseeable future.âPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated PurchasersâOn January 23, 2025, the Corporationâs Board of Directors announced a stock repurchase plan, authorizing the purchase of up to 334,773 shares of the Corporationâs outstanding common stock over a one-year period. In connection with this January 2025 plan, the previously extended September 2023 stock repurchase plan, which was extended for an additional year on September 26, 2024, and had 21,691 shares remaining available for repurchase as of January 23, 2025, was canceled effective January 24, 2025.âThe Corporation may purchase the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations.ââ47

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this document or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this document might not occur, and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These factors could cause our actual results for fiscal 2026 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect the Corporationâs consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations as well as its stock price performance.âGeneralâProvident, a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of the Bank upon the Bankâs conversion completed on June 27, 1996. Provident is regulated by the FRB. At June 30, 2025, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of $1.25 billion, total deposits of $888.8 million and total stockholdersâ equity of $128.5 million. Â Provident has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries.âThe Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, the insurer of its deposits. The Bankâs deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System since 1956.âThe Corporation operates in a single business segment through the Bank. The Bank's activities include attracting deposits, offering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and, to a lesser extent, other mortgage, commercial business and consumer loans. Deposits are collected primarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California.Â Loans are primarily originated and purchased in Southern and Northern California to be held for investment.Â There are various risks inherent in the Corporationâs business including, among others, the general business environment, interest rates, the California real estate market, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the repurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary market conditions to sell loans, competitive conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks.âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying selected Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.â50
Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesâThe discussion and analysis of the Corporationâs financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Corporationâs consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the reporting date. The estimates we consider most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations are those that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and that could materially change from period to period if different assumptions were used or if actual results differ from our assumptions.âFor the Corporation, these critical estimates primarily relate to:ââthe allowance for credit losses on loans and investment securities, andâthe provision for income taxes.âThese estimates involve significant uncertainty and are based on historical experience, current conditions, and other factors management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and discuss them with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1âSummary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.âAllowance for Credit Losses. The ACL involves significant judgment and assumptions by management, which has a material impact on the carrying value of financial assets. The Corporation adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2023 are presented under CECL.âAs required by ASC 326,Â onÂ July 1, 2023Â the Corporation implemented CECL and recognized a $1.2 million one-time increase to its ACL and a net of tax charge of $824,000 to retained earnings. Under ASC 326,Â the ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loanâs amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.âManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses on the Corporationâs loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporationâs control.Provision for Income Taxes. Management accounts for income taxes by estimating future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Corporationâs Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, management is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the Corporationâs income tax exposures, including judgments in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in managementâs subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations.âExecutive Summary and Operating StrategyâProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business 51
Table of Contentsoperations as Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, PFC. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank, consist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the Bank.âCommunity banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Bankâs full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Also, to a lesser extent, the Bank originates construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The primary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Additionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others.âThe Corporation plans to enhance its community banking business by moderately increasing its total assets, focusing on expanding single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, and commercial business loans. Additionally, the Corporation aims to reduce the percentage of retail time deposits in its deposit base while increasing the proportion of lower-cost checking and savings accounts. To diversify its deposit funding base, the Corporation will consider utilizing brokered certificates of deposit and public funds, subject to market conditions and funding needs. Â This strategy is designed to improve core revenue by achieving a higher net interest margin and, combined with the Corporationâs growth, ultimately increase net interest income. While the Corporationâs long-term strategy targets moderate growth, management acknowledges that this growth may be influenced by general economic conditions and other factors.âInvestment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to the Bankâs depositors. Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage to gross revenue.âPFC performs trustee services for the Bankâs real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment.âThere are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the Corporationâs control, including: changes in accounting principles, laws, regulation, interest rates and the economy, among others. The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. âThe California economic environment presents heightened risk to the Corporation, particularly with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Because the majority of the Corporationâs loans are secured by real estate located in California, significant declines in California property values could limit the Corporationâs ability to recover on defaulted loans through the sale of the underlying collateral. Within commercial real estate, the office sector continues to face elevated risk, driven by higher vacancy rates, slower leasing activity, and downward pressure on rental rates in certain California markets. These trends may negatively affect collateral values and the repayment capacity of borrowers. In response, the Bank has evaluated its existing loans collateralized by office properties for outsized concentrations and has implemented tighter underwriting standards for such collateral. At June 30, 2025, our commercial real estate portfolio totaled $72.8 million, of which $39.5 million, or 54.2%, was secured by various types of office properties, representing 3.8% of the total loan portfolio. While current credit performance within the office segment remains satisfactory, management continues to monitor the portfolio closely in light of evolving market conditions.The January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles, California did not have a material direct impact on the Bankâs customers or collateral in our market area. However, those events, along with more recent wildfires in other regions of the state, underscore the ongoing risks wildfires present to our loan portfolio. Potential indirect impacts include increased insurance premiums, stricter underwriting standards, shifts in property values, and localized economic disruptions such as business closures and job losses, all of which could elevate credit risk. Borrowers in affected areas may face financial hardship that could reduce repayment capacity and impair collateral values, particularly where insurance coverage is inadequate or claims are denied. Given the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires associated with climate change, these events could require higher provisions for loan losses. The Corporation remains committed to prudent risk management practices to mitigate potential impacts and support customers in navigating any related financial challenges.52
Table of ContentsâFor further details on risk factors and uncertainties, see âSafe-Harbor Statementâ included above in this Item 7, and Item 1A, "Risk Factors.ââComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2025 and 2024âTotal assets decreased $26.6 million, or 2%, to $1.25 billion at June 30, 2025 from $1.27 billion at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in investment securities and loans held for investment.âTotal cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the FRB of San Francisco, increased $1.7 million, or 3%, to $53.1 million at June 30, 2025 from $51.4 million at June 30, 2024.Â The increase was consistent with the Corporationâs strategy of adequately managing credit and liquidity risk.âTotal investment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased $20.9 million, or 16%, to $111.0 million at June 30, 2025 from $131.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on investment securities.Â During fiscal 2025, the Bank purchased $981,000 of investment securities and did not sell any investment securities; while during fiscal 2024, the Bank did not purchase or sell any investment securities. For additional information on investment securities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âLoans held for investment, net decreased $7.2 million, or 1%, to $1.05 billion at June 30, 2025 as compared to June 30, 2024. Â Total loan principal payments in fiscal 2025 were $133.3 million, up 33% from $99.9 million in fiscal 2024, while the Bank originated $122.7 million of loans held for investment in fiscal 2025, up 62% from $75.5 million in fiscal 2024. In both years these loans consisted primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The Bank did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2025 or 2024. Management attributes the increase in loan originations to the decision to increase or maintain the total balance of loans held for investment in response to higher loan prepayments in fiscal 2025. The balance of multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans, net of undisbursed loan funds, decreased $34.7 million, or 7%, to $497.9 million at June 30, 2025, from $532.6 million at June 30, 2024, representing 48% and 51% of loans held for investment, respectively. The balance of single-family loans held for investment increased $26.3 million, or 5%, to $544.4 million at June 30, 2025, from $518.1 million at June 30, 2024. There was no REO in fiscal 2025 and 2024. Â For additional information on loans held for investment, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âFHLB â San Francisco stock and other equity investments increased $190,000, or 2%, to $10.3 million at June 30, 2025, from $10.1 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a higher fair value adjustment of other equity investments, which consist solely of 1,297 shares of VISA Class C stock. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the fair value of these other equity investments was $730,000 and $540,000, respectively. The Bank did not purchase additional FHLB - San Francisco stock during fiscal 2025, while in fiscal 2024, the Bank purchased $63,000 of FHLB - San Francisco stock.âTotal deposits increased to $888.8 million at June 30, 2025 from $888.3 million at June 30, 2024. Transaction accounts decreased $38.0 million, or 6%, to $576.5 million at June 30, 2025 from $614.5 million at June 30, 2024, while time deposits increased $38.4 million, or 14%, to $312.3 million at June 30, 2025 from $273.9 million at June 30, 2024. Time deposits included brokered certificates of deposit of $131.0 million as of June 30, 2025, down slightly from $131.8 million at June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the percentage of transaction accounts to total deposits was 65% and 69%, respectively. Total retail deposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased to $757.8 million at June 30, 2025 from $756.5 million at June 30, 2024. This increase was due primarily to the increase in retail time deposits, which was largely offset by the decline in transaction account balances as some customers sought higher interest rates elsewhere. For additional information on deposits, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âBorrowings, consisting primarily of FHLB â San Francisco advances, decreased $25.4 million, or 11%, to $213.1 million at June 30, 2025 from $238.5 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to scheduled maturities that were not fully renewed. The weighted average maturity of the Corporationâs FHLB â San Francisco advances was approximately 10 months at June 30, 2025, down from 13 months at June 30, 2024. For additional information on borrowings, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.53
Table of ContentsâTotal stockholdersâ equity decreased $1.4 million, or 1%, to $128.5 million at June 30, 2025 from $129.9 million at June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of stock repurchases (see Part II, Item 5, âMarket for Registrantâs Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securitiesâ of this Form 10-K) and quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders, partly offset by net income and the amortization of stock-based compensation in fiscal 2025.ââComparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024âGeneral. The Corporation recorded net income of $6.3 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, down $1.1 million, or 15%, from $7.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a $2.3 million increase in non-interest expense and a $410,000 decrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a $666,000 recovery of credit losses recorded during fiscal 2025 as compared to a $63,000 recovery of credit losses during fiscal 2024, and a $546,000 increase in net interest income. The Corporation's efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, increased to 79% in fiscal 2025 from 73% in fiscal 2024 due primarily to an increase in non-interest expenses. Return on average assets in fiscal 2025 was 0.50% compared to 0.57% in fiscal 2024, and return on average stockholders' equity in fiscal 2025 was 4.79%, compared to 5.62% in fiscal 2024.âNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $546,000, or 2%, to $35.5 million in fiscal 2025 from $34.9 million in fiscal 2024. This increase reflects higher loan yields and the repricing of adjustable-rate loans, which outpaced increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Â The net interest margin increased 15 basis points to 2.93% in fiscal 2025 from 2.78% in fiscal 2024. Â The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $42.2 million, or 3%, to $1.21 billion in fiscal 2025 from $1.25 billion in fiscal 2024. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $39.4 million, or 3%, to $1.10 billion during fiscal 2025 as compared to $1.14 billion during fiscal 2024.âInterest Income. Total interest income increased $1.9 million, or 3%, to $56.6 million in fiscal 2025 from $54.7 million in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of interest income on loans receivable.âInterest income on loans receivable increased $2.3 million, or 5%, to $52.5 million in fiscal 2025 from $50.2 million in fiscal 2024. The increase was attributable to a higher average loan yield, partly offset by a lower average loan balance. The weighted average loan yield during fiscal 2025 increased 31 basis points to 5.00% from 4.69% in fiscal 2024, reflecting new loans being originated at higher interest rates and adjustable rate loans repricing higher due to overall higher market interest rates. The average balance of loans receivable decreased $18.2 million, or 2%, to $1.05 billion during fiscal 2025 from $1.07 billion during fiscal 2024. âInterest income on investment securities decreased $202,000, or 10%, to $1.9 million in fiscal 2025 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2024, due to a decrease in the average balance, partly offset by an increase in the average yield. The average balance of investment securities decreased $23.1 million, or 16%, to $121.4 million in fiscal 2025 from $144.5 million in fiscal 2024 mainly as a result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on investment securities increased 10 basis points to 1.53% for fiscal 2025 from 1.43% for fiscal 2024. The increase in the average yield of investment securities was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization resulting from lower principal payments. The total premium amortization in fiscal 2025 was $374,000, down $158,000, or 30%, from $532,000 in fiscal 2024.âDuring fiscal 2025, the Bank received $845,000 of cash dividends from the FHLB - San Francisco and other equity investments, an increase of $43,000, or 5%, from the $802,000 of cash dividends received in fiscal 2024, resulting in an average yield of 8.27% during fiscal 2025 compared to 8.35% during fiscal 2024. The average balance of these investments was $10.2 million during fiscal 2025, up 6% from $9.6 million during fiscal 2024. âInterest income on interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the FRB of San Francisco, decreased $296,000, or 18%, to $1.4 million in fiscal 2025 from $1.7 million in fiscal 2024, due to a lower average yield and, to a lesser extent, a lower average balance. The average yield decreased 69 basis points to 4.69% in fiscal 2025 from 5.38% in fiscal 2024, resulting from decreases in the targeted federal funds interest rates during fiscal 2025. The average balance of interest-earning deposits decreased $1.6 million, or 5%, to $29.0 million in fiscal 2025 from $30.6 million in fiscal 2024.54
Table of ContentsâInterest Expense. Total interest expense for fiscal 2025 was $21.2 million compared to $19.8 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $1.4 million or 7%.Â This increase was primarily attributable to a higher interest expense on deposits, particularly time deposits, partly offset by a lower interest expense on borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.93% during fiscal 2025, up 19 basis points from 1.74% during fiscal 2024, while the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was $1.10 billion during fiscal 2025, down $39.4 million, or 3%, from $1.14 billion during fiscal 2024. âInterest expense on deposits for fiscal 2025 was $11.2 million compared to $9.7 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $1.5 million or 16%. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of time deposits and modestly higher rates on time deposits and savings accounts. The average balance of time deposits increased $34.6 million, or 14%, to $282.5 million in fiscal 2025 from $247.9 million in fiscal 2024, while the average balance of transaction accounts decreased $69.0 million, or 10%, to $599.2 million in fiscal 2025 from $668.2 million in fiscal 2024. The time deposits include brokered certificates of deposit. The average balance of brokered certificates of deposit in fiscal 2025 was $134.0 million with the average cost of 4.65% compared to the average balance of $118.8 million with the average cost of 5.17% in fiscal 2024. The average cost of time deposits (including brokered certificates of deposit) in fiscal 2025 was 3.73%, up seven basis points, from 3.66% in fiscal 2025, while the average cost of transaction accounts was 0.12% in fiscal 2025, up three basis points from 0.09% in fiscal 2024. The average cost of all deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased 21 basis points to 1.27% in fiscal 2025 from 1.06% in fiscal 2024.
âInterest expense on borrowings, consisting primarily FHLB - San Francisco advances, for fiscal 2025 decreased $212,000, or 2%, to $9.9 million as compared to $10.1 million in fiscal 2024.Â The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was due to a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average cost. The average balance of borrowings decreased $5.1 million, or 2%, to $216.3 million during fiscal 2025 from $221.4 million during fiscal 2024 and the average cost of borrowings was 4.59% in fiscal 2025, up one basis point from 4.58% in fiscal 2024.âProvision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses. During fiscal 2025, the Corporation recorded a recovery of credit losses of $666,000, compared to a recovery of $63,000 during fiscal 2024. The increase in the recovery of credit losses in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to improved qualitative factors related to the single-family residential loans and lower historical loss rates, partially offset by an increase in the balance of single-family loans.âAt June 30, 2025, the ACL on loans held for investment was $6.4 million, comprised of all collectively evaluated allowances, down 9% from $7.1 million at June 30, 2024. The ACL on loans as a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 0.62% at June 30, 2025, compared to 0.67% at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the ACL on loans was due primarily to the recovery of credit losses recorded in fiscal 2025.â55
Table of ContentsThe following chart quantifies the factors contributing to the changes in the ACL on loans held for investment (âLHFIâ) for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.âââManagement believes, based on currently available information, that the ACL is sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in loans held for investment at June 30, 2025 and 2024. The ACL is determined in accordance with ASC 326, which requires the recognition of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans, considering historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For additional information, see Item 1, âBusiness - âAsset Qualityâ in this Form 10-K.âNon-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was $3.5 million in fiscal 2025, a decrease of $410,000 or 10% from $3.9 million in fiscal 2024, due primarily to decreases in card and processing fees and other non-interest income.âLoan servicing and other fees increased $82,000, or 24%, to $419,000 in fiscal 2025 from $337,000 in fiscal 2024, due primarily to higher late fees on loans. âDeposit account fees decreased $42,000, or 4%, to $1.1 million in fiscal 2025 from $1.2 million in fiscal 2024, due primarily to lower non-sufficient funds fees, associated with fewer transactions.56
Table of ContentsâCard and processing fees decreased $119,000, or 9%, to $1.3 million in fiscal 2025 from $1.4 million in fiscal 2024, due primarily to fewer debit card transactions.âOther non-interest income decreased $331,000, or 31%, to $735,000 in fiscal 2025 from $1.1 million in fiscal 2024. The prior year included a $540,000 net gain on other equity investments from the VISA share conversion, partly offset by a $190,000 positive fair value adjustment on the VISA equity investment in fiscal 2025. âNon-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense was $30.8 million in fiscal 2025, an increase of $2.3 million or 8% from $28.5 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, equipment expense and other non-interest expenses.âSalaries and employee benefits increased $1.4 million, or 8%, to $19.0 million in fiscal 2025 from $17.6 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily attributable to increases in compensation costs, incentive compensation, group insurance costs and executive search costs. âEquipment expense increased $233,000, or 18%, to $1.5 million in fiscal 2025 from $1.3 million in fiscal 2024, due primarily to higher software license and maintenance costs. âOther non-interest expenses increased $594,000, or 20%, to $3.6 million in fiscal 2025 from $3.0 million in fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to higher litigation settlement expenses, debit card operation costs, deposit related costs and other operating costs. During fiscal 2025, the Bank recognized a $232,000 expense related to the settlement of wage and hour claims under Californiaâs Private Attorneys General Act filed by former employees. The claims, which were previously stayed pending mediation, were resolved through a global settlement agreement in February 2025. No litigation reserve had been established prior to the settlement, which does not include any admission of liability and remains subject to court approval.âProvision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and bank-owned life insurance policies, among others.Â Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before taxes.âThe provision for income taxes was $2.6 million for fiscal 2025, representing an effective tax rate of 29.5%, down $418,000 or 14% from $3.0 million in fiscal 2024, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%. The decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was due primarily to a lower income before the provision for income taxes.âThe Corporationâs effective tax rate may differ from the estimated tax rates described above due to discrete items such as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets or liabilities, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items. The Corporation determined that the above tax rates meet its estimated income tax obligations.

For purposes of calculating volume, rate and rate/volume variances, non-performing loansÂ were included in the weighted average balance outstanding.âLiquidity and Capital ResourcesâThe Bankâs primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities, proceeds from FHLB - San Francisco advances, access to the discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco and access to the correspondent bankâs federal funds facility. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.âThe primary investing activity of the Bank has been the origination and, to a lesser extent, purchase of loans held for investment. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank originated loans held for investment of $122.7 million and $75.5 million, respectively.Â The Bank did not purchase any loans held for investment from other financial institutions in fiscal 2025 or 2024. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had loan origination commitments totaling $6.1 million and $9.4 million, with undisbursed loan funds of $582,000 and $435,000, respectively. The Bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments.âThe Bank's primary financing activity is gathering deposits, which include both retail and brokered certificates of deposit. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the net increase in deposits was $424,000, compared to the net decrease of $62.2 million during fiscal 2024. On June 30, 2025, time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less were $278.3 million.Â Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant percentage of its time deposits as they mature by adjusting deposit rates based upon the current interest rate environment.âThe Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At June 30, 2025, total cash and cash equivalents were $53.1 million, or 4.3% of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products and FHLB - San Francisco advances, the Bank may continue to rely on FHLB - San Francisco advances for part 59
Table of Contentsof its liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2025, the remaining financing availability at the FHLB - San Francisco was $282.3 million and the remaining available collateral was $364.9 million.Â In addition, the Bank has a $142.5 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco, collateralized by $24.8 million of investment securities and $227.0 million of loans held for investment.Â The Bank also has a federal funds facility with a correspondent bank for $50.0 million which matures on March 31, 2026.Â As of June 30, 2025, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or the federal funds facility with the correspondent bank. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources was approximately $474.8 million at June 30, 2025.âRegulations require the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank's average liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 decreased to 8.9% from 16.6% during the same quarter ended June 30, 2024.Â The decrease in the liquidity ratio was due primarily to the decrease in average qualifying liquid assets which exceeded the decrease in average deposits and borrowings during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 in comparison to the quarter ended June 30, 2024.Â Despite the decrease, the Bank continues to maintain sufficient liquidity, supported by borrowing capacity at the FHLB â San Francisco, the FRB of San Francisco, and its correspondent bank, and management believes the current liquidity position is adequate to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements. Management believes that, given these sources and ongoing liquidity management practices, the Bank is well-positioned to meet funding requirements. Management will continue to adjust the balance of liquid assets and funding sources as necessary to maintain adequate liquidity and support the Bankâs operations and lending activities.âWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations.âBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2026 we project expenditures ranging from $532,000 to $1.1 million for capital investment in premises and equipment. For additional information regarding our commitments, see Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.âProvident is a separate legal entity from the Bank and, on a stand-alone level, must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses, cash dividends and stock repurchases. Providentâs primary sources of funds consist of capital raised through dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. During fiscal 2025, the Corporation purchased 285,170 shares of the Corporationâs common stock with a weighted average cost of $15.04 per share. As of June 30, 2025, there are 217,028 shares available for purchase under the Corporationâs existing stock repurchase plan. The Corporation purchases the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. In addition, we currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.14 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a substantial portion of our cash flow to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal 2026 at this rate of $0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $921,000 based on the number of our current outstanding shares as of June 30, 2025. At June 30, 2025, Provident (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of approximately $3.4 million. âThe Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the OCC. Under the OCC's capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bankâs assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bankâs capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. In addition, 60
Table of ContentsProvident Financial Holdings, Inc., as a savings and loan holding company registered with the FRB, is required by the FRB to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the OCC requirements. Since the holding company has less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the FRB expects the holding companyâs subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.âAt June 30, 2025, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Under the prompt corrective action provisions, minimum ratios of 5.0% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital, 6.5% for CET1 Capital, 8.0% for Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and 10.0% for Total Risk-based Capital are required to be deemed âwell capitalized.â As of June 30, 2025, the Bank exceeded the capital ratios needed to be considered well capitalized with Tier 1 Leverage Capital, CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and Total Risk-based Capital ratios of 10.1%, 19.5%, 19.5% and 20.5%, respectively.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskâQuantitative Aspects of Market Risk. The Corporation does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it purchase high-risk derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Corporation is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. The primary market risk that the Corporation faces is interest rate risk. For information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the Corporation's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, see âInterest Rate Riskâ below and Item 1, âBusiness - Lending Activities - Maturity of Loans Held for Investment,â â- Investment Securities Activities,â and â- Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Time Deposits by Remaining MaturityâÂ in this Form 10-K.âInterest Rate Risk. One of the Corporation's principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The Corporation, through the Corporation's Asset-Liability Committee, has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation's interest-earning assets by retaining new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions. The Corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing brokered certificates of deposit and FHLB - San Francisco advances as secondary sources of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered certificates of deposit, reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to seven years. For additional information, see Item 7, âManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ in this Form 10-K.âThrough the use of an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the change in net portfolio value (âNPVâ) over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations. The calculation is intended to illustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -300, -200, -100, +100, +200 and +300 basis points (âbpâ) with no effect given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movement. As of June 30, 2025, the targeted federal funds rate range was 4.25% to 4.50%.ââ61

The increase of the NPV ratios was primarily attributable changes in asset and liability balances, interest rates, and portfolio composition. The sensitivity measure increased to 98 basis points at June 30, 2025 from 95 basis points at June 30, 2024.âAs with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation.âThe Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity "gap" analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest rates. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual repricing or scheduled maturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits) that have no contractual 62

Management views noninterest-bearing deposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term funding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity for savings and money market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances are assumed to be subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15% per year, savings deposits at 20% per year and money market deposits at 50% in the first and second years.â63
Table of ContentsThe gap results presented above are based on specific assumptions and represent a static view of interest rate risk at a point in time. Actual experience may vary if assumptions differ or if customersâ behaviors and market conditions change.âThe impact of changes in prevailing interest rates on the Corporationâs net interest margin will depend on how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities adjust to rate changes. Rates on certain assets or liabilities may lag behind market rates, and factors such as loan prepayments or early deposit withdrawals can further affect cash flows. Management believes the results of the interest rate sensitivity analysis reflect the Corporationâs current asset-liability positioning, but the projected changes in net interest income assume immediate and sustained shifts in market rates and do not include any actions management might take in response. Actual results could differ materially due to variations in customer behavior, market conditions, and competitive pressures.âThe Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items:ââThe Corporationâs current balance sheet and repricing characteristics;âForecasted balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan;âCurrent interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates;âEmbedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps;âRepricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments;âLoan, investment security, deposit and borrowing cash flows;âLoan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; andâImmediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of +300, +200 +100, and -100, -200 and -300 bp.âThe following table describes the results of the analysis at June 30, 2025 and 2024:âââââââââAt JuneÂ 30,Â 2025âAt JuneÂ 30,Â 2024Â Basis Point (bp)âChangeÂ inâBasisÂ PointÂ (bp)âChangeÂ inÂ  Change in RatesâNetÂ InterestÂ IncomeâChangeÂ inÂ RatesâNetÂ InterestÂ IncomeÂ +300 bpÂ Â Â Â -1.35%â+300 bpÂ Â Â Â -8.12%â+200 bpÂ +2.01%â+200 bpÂ -3.45%â+100 bpÂ +2.23%â+100 bpÂ -0.51%â-100 bpÂ -1.80%â-100 bpÂ -0.67%â-200 bpÂ -3.24%â-200 bpÂ -1.15%â-300 bpâ-6.38%â-300 bpâ-1.86%ââAt June 30, 2025, the Corporation was asset sensitive as its interest-earning assets are expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12-month period; while at June 30, 2024, the Corporation was close to neutral with regard to the sensitivity of net interest income as projected net interest income declines slightly under rising or declining interest rates during the subsequent 12-month period. âTherefore at June 30, 2025, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period, except at the +300 basis point scenario. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period.âManagement believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable. However, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore, the model results that the Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporationâs current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve.ââ64

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureâNone.ââItem 9A. Controls and Proceduresâa)An evaluation of the Corporationâs disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âActâ)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporationâs Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer) and the Corporationâs Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the Corporationâs disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporationâs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporationâs disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2025 are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporationâs management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms.âb)There have been no changes in the Corporationâs internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporationâs internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(the "Corporation"), Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. which is subject to Part 363 in the statement of management's responsibilities; the report on management's assessment of compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; and the report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting.âManagement of the Corporation is responsible for preparing the Corporationâs annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP); and for complying with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions. The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.âTo comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Corporation designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting was also conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), which include controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP).âBecause of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP), is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).âManagement of the Corporation has assessed the Corporation's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions during the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2025. Management has concluded that the Corporation complied with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions during the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2025.ââDate: August 29, 2025âÂ âÂ /s/ Donavon P.

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmâTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc.âOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and subsidiary (the âCorporationâ) as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholdersâ equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related (collectively referred to as the âfinancial statementsâ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporationâs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporationâs financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporationâs internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.â75
Table of ContentsAllowance for Credit Losses related to Qualitative Factors for Single Family Mortgage, Multifamily Mortgage, and Commercial Real Estate - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the Financial StatementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionManagement estimates the Corporationâs allowance for credit losses (âACLâ) Management calculates the quantitative portion of the collectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an average charge-off methodology. The Corporation primarily utilizes historical loss rates for the ACL based on its own specific historical losses and/or with peer loss history where applicable. Management considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loans may be warranted, given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. The qualitative portion of the Corporationâs allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using management judgment, to determine risk categorizations in each of the qualitative factors. The amount of qualitative allowance is also contingent upon the relative weighting of the qualitative factors according to managementâs judgment.Auditing the collectively evaluated loans of the Corporationâs ACL, specifically managementâs qualitative loss factors for certain single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans, involved significant judgment. Given the management judgments required for the determination of risk categorization and relative weighting of qualitative factors, performing audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative factors in the ACL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the ACL included the following, among others:âWe performed inquiries and examined documentation to understand managementâs methodology and process in determining the qualitative factors in the ACL, including the key assumptions and relevant data utilized.âWe involved our credit specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the qualitative methodologies applied by management.âWe tested the design and implementation of controls over the (i) selection of the risk categorizations and relative weighting in each of the qualitative factors used as an input to the model and (ii) overall calculation and disclosure.âWe evaluated the reasonableness of the ACL inputs, including managementâs judgments and assumptions used in the development of the qualitative factors, including the directional consistency and magnitude of the qualitative factors applied, and the reasonableness of the period selected for the forecast and the associated economic factors identified by management.âWe compared the Corporationâs ACL with benchmark data obtained independently to assess whether the ACL is within a reasonable range for specific loan categories.ââ/s/Deloitte & Touche LLPâCosta Mesa, CaliforniaAugust 29, 2025âWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 2001.âââ76

Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNoteÂ 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesâBasis of presentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Holdings,Â Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (collectively, the âCorporationâ). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.âProvident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the âBankâ) converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank effective, JuneÂ 27, 1996. Provident Financial Holdings,Â Inc., a Delaware corporation organized by the Bank, acquired all of the capital stock of the Bank issued in the conversion; the transaction was recorded on a book value basis.âThe Corporation has determined that it operates in one business segment through the Bank. The Bank's activities include attracting deposits, offering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and other mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business and consumer loans held for investment. Deposits are collected primarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. Additional activities may include originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first mortgages. Loans are primarily originated and purchased in California.âUse of estimatesThe accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (âGAAPâ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of investment securities, deferred tax assets (liabilities), and deferred compensation costs.âThe following accounting policies, together with those disclosed elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements, represent the significant accounting policies of Provident Financial Holdings,Â Inc. and the Bank.âCash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and due from banks, as well as overnight deposits placed at the FRB â San Francisco and correspondent banks.âInvestment securitiesThe Corporation classifies its qualifying investments as available for sale or held to maturity. The Corporation classifies investments as held to maturity when it has the ability and it is managementâs positive intent to hold such securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized historical cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. Fair value generally is determined based upon quoted market prices. Changes in net unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Gains and losses on sale or dispositions of investment securities are included in non-interest income and are determined using the specific identification method. Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized over the expected average life of the securities using the effective interest method.âThe Corporation evaluates individual investment securities quarterly for impairment based on Accounting Standards Codification (âASCâ) 326, âFinancial Instruments â Credit Losses.â As a part of the Corporationâs monthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Corporationâs assessment that the Corporation has the ability to hold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs is realized and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized costs.â82
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsLoans held for investmentLoans held for investment primarily consist of long-term, fixed- and adjustable-rate loans secured by single-family residences, as well as multi-family and commercial real estate loans secured by multi-family and commercial properties, and loans secured by land and other residential properties. The Corporation intends to hold these loans for the foreseeable future. They are generally offered to customers and businesses located in California.âNet loan origination fees and certain direct origination expenses are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. Amortization is discontinued for non-performing loans. Interest receivable primarily represents the current monthâs interest, which will be included as a part of the borrowerâs next monthly loan payment. Interest receivable is accrued only if deemed collectible. Generally, a loan is placed on non-performing status when it becomes 90Â days past due as to principal or interest or after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrowerâs financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. When a loan is placed on non-performing status, interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income. Interest income on non-performing loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible. If the principal balance is not deemed collectible, the entire payment received (principal and interest) is applied to the outstanding loan balance. Non-performing loans that become current as to both principal and interest are returned to accrual status after demonstrating satisfactory payment history (usually six consecutive months) and when future payments are expected to be collectible.âAllowance for credit lossesThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management, which has a material impact on the carrying value of financial assets. The Corporation adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. âNon-performing loansThe Corporation assesses loans individually and classifies them as non-performing when the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans have been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties or management has serious doubts about the future collectability of principal and interest, even though the loans may currently be performing. Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The Corporation measures each non-performing loan based on ASC 326, establishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance, and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible. Loans identified to be individually evaluated may have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the collateral, less selling costs or discounted cash flow with an appropriate default factor.âReal estate ownedReal estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the fair value of the real estate acquired, less estimated selling costs. Subsequent to foreclosure, the Corporation charges current earnings for estimated losses if the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value. Gains or losses on the sale of real estate are recognized upon disposition of the property. Costs relating to improvement, maintenance and repairs of the property are charged to operations as incurred.âImpairment of long-lived assetsThe Corporation reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets include buildings, land, fixtures, furniture and equipment. An asset is considered impaired when the expected discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life are less than the net book value. When impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment loss is the excess of the net book value over its fair value.â83

Depreciation is computed primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:ââââBuildingsÂ Â Â Â 10 to 40 yearsFurniture and fixturesâ3 to 10 yearsAutomobilesâ3 to 5 yearsComputer equipmentâ3 to 5 yearsâLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their respective lease terms or the useful life of the improvement, which ranges from one to 10 years. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred.âIncome taxesThe Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, âIncome Taxes.âÂ Â ASC 740 requires the affirmative evaluation that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a tax position, that an enterprise is entitled to economic benefits resulting from positions taken in income tax returns. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.âASC 740 requires that when determining the need for a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset, management must assess both positive and negative evidence with regard to the realizability of the tax losses represented by that asset. To the extent available, if sources of taxable income are insufficient to absorb tax losses, a valuation allowance is necessary. Sources of taxable income for this analysis include priorÂ yearsâ tax returns, the expected reversals of taxable temporary differences between book and tax income, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, and future taxable income. The deferred income tax asset related to the allowance for credit losses will be realized when actual charge-offs are made against the allowance. Based on the availability of loss carry-backs and projected taxable income during the periods for which loss carry-forwards are available, management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will realize the deferred tax assets (liabilities). The Corporation continues to monitor the deferred tax assets or liabilities on a quarterly basis for a valuation allowance. The future realization of these tax benefits primarily hinges on adequate future earnings to utilize the tax benefit. Prospective earnings or losses, tax law changes or capital changes could prompt the Corporation to reevaluate the assumptions which may be used to establish a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2025, the estimated net deferred tax liability was $832,000 and is included in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities in Â the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition; while, at June 30, 2024, the estimated net deferred tax asset was $606,000 and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets. The Corporation maintains the net deferred tax asset or liability for deductible temporary tax differences, such as loss reserves, deferred compensation, non-accrued interest and unrealized gains or losses, among other items. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Corporationâs net deferred tax position changed from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. This change was primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax assets previously recognized in connection with accrued Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan obligations, which were settled during the year, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities associated with unrealized gains on other equity investments, which are recorded through net income and result in taxable temporary differences. The Corporation did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefit at June 30, 2025 or 2024.âBank owned life insurance ("BOLI")ASC 715-60-35, "Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements," requires an employer to recognize obligations associated with endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements that extend into the participantâs post-employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or based on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement. The Corporation adopted ASC 715-60-35 using the latter option, i.e., based on the future death benefit. The Bank purchases BOLI policies on the lives of certain executive officers while they are employed by the Bank and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. The Bank invests in BOLI to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. The Bank records these BOLI policies within prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at each policyâs respective cash surrender value, with net changes recorded in other non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.â84
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsCash dividendA declaration or payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Corporationâs Board of Directors, who take into account the Corporationâs financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, economic conditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the current fiscalÂ year and/or the preceding fiscalÂ year in which the dividend is declared. For additional information, see NoteÂ 19 of the NotesÂ to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the subsequent event related to the cash dividend.âStock repurchasesThe Corporation repurchased 285,170 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $15.04 per share during fiscal 2025 pursuant to its publicly announced stock repurchase plans. As of June 30, 2025, 217,028 shares, or 65% of the shares authorized for repurchase, remained available under the Corporationâs existing repurchase plan, which is set to expire on January 23, 2026.âEarnings per common share (âEPSâ)Basic EPS represents net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period excluding any potential dilutive effects. Diluted EPS gives effect to any potential issuance of common stock that would have caused basic EPS to be lower as if the issuance had already occurred. Accordingly, diluted EPS reflects an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the assumed exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. The computation of diluted EPS does not assume exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock that would have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS.âStock-based compensationASC 718, âCompensationÂ â Stock Compensation,â requires companies to recognize in the Consolidated Statements of Operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and directors. Stock-based compensation, inclusive of restricted stock expense, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for theÂ fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was $543,000 and $240,000, respectively.âEmployee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP")The Corporation recognizes compensation expense when the Bank contributes funds to the ESOP for the purchase of the Corporationâs common stock to be allocated to the ESOP participants. Since the contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be estimated.âRestricted stockThe Corporation recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period of the shares awarded, equal to the fair value of the shares at the award date. A total of $472,000 and $203,000 of restricted stock expense was amortized during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.âPost-retirement benefitsThe estimated obligation for post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits is determined based on an actuarial computation of the cost of current and future benefits for the eligible (grandfathered) retirees and employees. The post retirement benefit liability is included in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Effective JulyÂ 1, 2003, the Corporation discontinued the post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits to any employee not previously qualified (grandfathered) for these benefits, unless included within an employment agreement. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the accrued liability for post-retirement benefits was $741,000 and $450,000, respectively.âComprehensive incomeUnder ASC 220, âComprehensive Income,â comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, including unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and interest-only strips. Accumulated comprehensive income (loss) is reported as a separate component of the stockholdersâ equity section of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Stockholdersâ Equity.85
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsAccounting Standard Updates (âASUâ)ASU 2024-03:In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Topic 220): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. ASU 2024-03 requires public business entities (âPBEsâ) to disclose disaggregated information about specific natural expense categories underlying certain income statement expense line items that are considered relevant expense captions because they include one or more of the five natural expense categories identified in this ASU. Such disclosures must be made on an annual and interim basis in a tabular format in the footnotes to the financial statements. The ASU requires entities to disaggregate any relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations into the following required natural expense categories, as applicable: (1) inventory purchases, (2) employee compensation, (3) depreciation, (4) intangible asset amortization, and (5) depreciation, depletion and amortization recognized as part of oil- and gas-producing activities or other depletion expenses. The ASU does not affect the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement. Rather, it requires additional disaggregation of those captions into specified natural expense categories in the financial statement footnotes. This ASU is effective for all PBEs for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.âASU 2023-09:In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires PBEs to annually (a) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (b) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold of equal to or greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing the impact of this ASU and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. âASU 2023-07:In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments include: (a) introducing a new requirement to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision makerâ¯(âCODMâ), (b) extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods, (c) clarifying that single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, (d) permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and (e) requiring disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. This ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Corporation operates as a single segment and reporting unit; therefore, the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Corporationâs consolidated financial statements but resulted in expanded disclosures within Note 17 on Segment Reporting.â86

The unrealized losses on investment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities, which are predominately U.S. government sponsored enterprise (âGSEâ) securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have 88
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsa long history of no credit losses. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating nature of interest rates, and not related to any potential credit risks within the investment portfolio. The Bank does not currently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale and as such, records the investment security at amortized cost or fair market value as prescribed by GAAP. As a part of the Corporationâs monthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Corporationâs assessment that the Corporation has the ability to hold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized costs are realized and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized costs.âIn order to maintain adequate liquidity, the Bank has established borrowing facilities with various counterparties. The Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of $282.3 million as of June 30, 2025 at the FHLB of San Francisco.Â In addition, the Bank has secured an estimated $142.5 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by single-family loans held for investment totaling $227.0 million and investment securities totaling $24.8 million as of June 30, 2025.Â As of June 30, 2025, the Bank also has an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under the Federal Reserve discount window or correspondent bank facility as of June 30, 2025. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately $474.8 million at June 30, 2025.âAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of $261.3 million at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition, the Bank had secured an estimated $208.6 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by single-family loans held for investment totaling $178.6 million and investment securities totaling $126.6 million at June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank also had an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under the Federal Reserve discount window or the correspondent bank facility as of June 30, 2024. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately $519.9 million at June 30, 2024.âAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment securities available for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until maturity. It also determined that it was more likely than not that the Corporation would not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis; therefore, no impairment losses were recorded on investment securities available for sale for fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. In addition, no allowance for credit losses were recorded on investment securities held to maturity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.â89

Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsThe following table sets forth information at June 30, 2025 regarding the dollar amount of loans held for investment that are contractually repricing during the periods indicated, segregated between adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans. Fixed-rate loans comprised 10% of loans held for investment at both June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Adjustable-rate loans with no stated repricing date that reprice when the index to which they are tied to reprices (e.g. prime rate index) and checking account overdrafts are reported as repricing within oneÂ year, subject to periodic and maximum rate caps.

The two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper ACL levels are individually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. The collectively evaluated allowance is based on a pooling method for groups of homogeneous loans sharing similar loan characteristics to calculate an allowance which reflects an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans identified to be individually evaluated may have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the collateral, less selling costs, or discounted cash flow with an appropriate default factor.The Corporation adopted an internal risk rating policy which categorizes all loans held for investment into risk categories of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades with respect to credit quality of each loan is as follows:âPassÂ â A pass loan ranges from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The likelihood of loss is considered remote.âSpecial MentionÂ - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected, may result in a loss. While concerns exist, the Corporation is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and not imminent.âSubstandardÂ - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.âDoubtfulÂ - A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.âLossÂ - A loss loan is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Corporation is not warranted.93

Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsAs required by ASC 326Â onÂ July 1, 2023,Â the Corporation implemented CECL and recognized a $1.2 million one-time increase to its ACL. Under ASC 326,Â the ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loansâ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Corporationâs ACL is calculated quarterly, with any difference between the calculated ACL and the recorded ACL adjusted through an entry to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses. Management calculates the quantitative portion of the collectively evaluated allowance for all loan categories using an average charge-off or loss rate methodology, and generally evaluates collectively evaluated loans by Call Report code to group and determine portfolio loan segments with similar risk characteristics. The Corporation primarily utilizes historical loss rates for the ACL calculation based on its own specific historical losses and/or with peer loss history, where applicable. âThe expected loss rates are applied to expected monthly loan balances estimated through the consideration of contractual repayment terms and expected prepayments. The prepayment assumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual life of the loans are estimated based on historical and bank-specific experience and the consideration of current and expected conditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptionsÂ mayÂ be updated by management in the event that changing conditions impact managementâs estimate or additional historical data gathered has resulted in the need for a reevaluation.âFor its reasonable and supportable forecasting of current expected credit losses, the Corporation utilizes a regression model using forecasted economic metrics and historical loss data. The regression model utilized upon implementation of CECLÂ and as ofÂ June 30, 2025 and 2024,Â based on reasonable and supportable 12-month forecasts of the National Unemployment Rate and change in the Real Gross Domestic Product, after which it reverts to a historical loss rate. Management selected the National Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic Product as the drivers of the forward looking component of the collectively evaluated allowance, primarily as a result of high correlation coefficients identified in regression modeling, the availability of forecasts (including the quarterly Federal Open Market Committee forecast), and the widespread familiarity of these economic metrics.âManagement recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in the quantitative portion of allowance on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditionsÂ mayÂ vary compared with conditions over the historical lookback period, which is utilized in the calculation of the quantitative allowance, management considers whether additional or reduced allowance levels on collectively evaluated loansÂ mayÂ be warranted, given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. The following qualitative factors (âQ-factorsâ) considered by management reflect the regulatory guidance on the Q-factors:ââChanges in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.âChanges in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.âThe existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.âChanges in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.âThe effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio.âChanges in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-performing loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans.âChanges in the quality of the Corporationâs loan review system.âChanges in the nature, volume and terms of loans in the portfolio.âChanges in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.Â The qualitative portion of the Corporationâs allowance on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using managementâs judgment to determine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative allowance is also contingent upon the relative weighting of the Q-factors, as determined by managementâs judgment.Â 96
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsLoans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that foreclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting date, less selling costs. âAccrued interest receivable for loans is included in accrued interest receivable in the Â Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.Â The Corporation electedÂ notÂ to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse accrued interest income on loans that are placed on non-performing status.Â Generally, a loan is placed on non-performing status when it becomes 90Â days past due as to principal or interest or after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrowerâs financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. The Corporation believes this policy results in the timely reversal of potentially uncollectible interest.âPursuant to ASU 2022-02, âTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,â the CorporationÂ mayÂ agree to different types of modifications, including principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extension, significant payment delay or any combination of modifications noted above. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, there wereÂ noÂ loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.âManagement believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses on the Corporationâs loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporationâs control.Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. This generally occurs after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were previously modified from their original terms, re-underwritten and identified as modified loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. In cases where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the ACL. For modified loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the ACL is segregated into: (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their modification period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component; or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for modified loans) or collateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required. A non-performing loan can be restored to accrual status when a borrower is current in payments for six consecutive months. Â 97

Generally, a loan is placed on non-performing status when it becomes 90Â days past due as to principal or interest or after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrowerâs financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current, the borrower(s)Â has demonstrated sustained payment performance and futureÂ monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected on a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance have been (a) collectively evaluated using a pooling method analysis or (b) individually evaluated using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less costs to sell, to establish realizable value. This analysis may identify a specific allowance amount needed or may conclude that no allowance is needed.âââââââââââââââââââââââââAtÂ orÂ ForÂ the Year Ended JuneÂ 30,Â 2025ââUnpaidâââââââNetâAverageâInterestââPrincipalâRelatedâRecordedâââRecordedâRecordedâIncome(In Thousands)Â Â Â Â BalanceÂ Â Â Â Charge-offsÂ Â Â Â InvestmentÂ Â Â Â ACL(1)Â Â Â Â InvestmentÂ Â Â Â InvestmentÂ Â Â Â RecognizedââââââââââââââââââââââMortgage loans:âââââââââââââââââââââSingle-family:Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â With a related allowanceâ$ 560â$ ââ$ 560â$ (7)â$ 553â$ 1,158â$ 95Without a related allowance(2)âÂ  420âÂ  (25)âÂ  395âÂ  ââÂ  395âÂ  631âÂ  106Total single-family loansâÂ  980âÂ  (25)âÂ  955âÂ  (7)âÂ  948âÂ  1,789âÂ  201ââââââââââââââââââââââMulti-family:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Without a related allowance(2)âÂ  466âÂ  ââÂ  466âÂ  ââÂ  466âÂ  156âÂ  5Total multi-family loansâÂ  466âÂ  ââÂ  466âÂ  ââÂ  466âÂ  156âÂ  5ââââââââââââââââââââââCommercial real estate:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Without a related allowance(2)âÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  149âÂ  36Total commercial real estate loansâÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  149âÂ  36ââââââââââââââââââââââTotal non-performing loansâ$ 1,446â$ (25)â$ 1,421â$ (7)â$ 1,414â$ 2,094â$ 242â(1)ACL, specifically assigned to the individual loan.(2)There was no related ACL because the loans were charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral was higher than the loan balance.â99

The Corporation records payments on non-performing loans utilizing the cash basis or cost recovery method of accounting during the periods when the loans are on non-performing status. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Corporation received $242,000 in interest payments from non-performing loans, all of which was recognized as interest income under cash basis and none was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method. In comparison, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Bank received $119,000 in interest payments from non-performing loans, all of which was recognized as interest income under cash basis and none was applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method. âSince the implementation of ASC 326, the Bank includes the off-balance sheet reserve for unfunded loan commitments within the provision for (recovery of) credit losses.âThe following table provides information regarding the unfunded loan commitment reserve for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:ââââââââââYear Ended ââJuneÂ 30,Â (In Thousands)Â Â Â Â 2025Â Â Â Â 2024Balance, beginning of the yearâ$ 57â$ 42(Recovery of) provision for credit lossesâÂ  (25)âÂ  15Balance, end of the yearâ$ 32â$ 57âThe method for calculating the unfunded loan commitment reserve is based on a historical funding rate applied to the undisbursed loan amount to estimate an average outstanding amount during the life of the loan commitment. The Corporation applies the same assumptions and methodologies to both unfunded loan commitments and funded loans held for investment, grouped by loan category, to determine the reserve rate and allowance.

During fiscal 2025 and 2024, there were no related-party loan transactions and as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no outstanding related-party loans.âââNoteÂ 4: LeasesâThe Corporation accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842, which requires the Corporation to record liabilities for future lease obligations as well as assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets. The Corporation's leases primarily represent future obligations to make payments for the use of buildings, space or equipment for its operations. Liabilities to make future lease payments are recorded in accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities for operating leases, and borrowings for finance leases, while right-of-use assets are recorded in premises and equipment in the Corporationâs Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation's leases were classified as operating leases and finance leases; and the Corporation did not have any operating or finance leases with an initial term of 12 months or less ("short-term leases"). Liabilities to make future lease payments and right-of-use assets are recorded for operating leases and finance leases and do not include short-term leases. These liabilities and right-of-use assets are determined based on the total contractual base 101
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsrents for each lease, which include options to extend or renew each lease, where applicable, and where the Corporation believes it has an economic incentive to extend or renew the lease. Since lease extensions are not reasonably certain, the Corporation generally does not recognize payments occurring during option periods in the calculation of its right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities. The Corporation utilizes the FHLB â San Francisco rates as a discount rate for each of the remaining contractual terms at the adoption date as well as for future leases if the discount rate is not stated in the lease. For leases that contain variable lease payments, the Corporation assumes future lease payment escalations based on a lease payment escalation rate specified in the lease or the specified index rate observed at the time of lease commencement. Liabilities to make future lease payments are accounted for using the interest method, being reduced by periodic contractual lease payments net of periodic interest accretion. Right-of-use assets for operating leases are amortized over the lease term in amounts that represent the difference between straight-line lease expense and interest accretion on the related liability. For finance leases, right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the underlying asset, while interest accretion on the lease liability is recognized as interest expense in the Corporationâs Consolidated Statements of Operations.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, expenses associated with the Corporationâs leases totaled $774,000, and $927,000, respectively. Expenses associated with the Corporationâs leases are recorded in either premises and occupancy or equipment expense for operating leases; while for finance leases, expenses are recorded in equipment expense and interest expense on borrowings, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.â102

If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. Management has determined that there were no unrecognized tax benefits to be reported in the Corporationâs consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.âUnder GAAP, the Corporation uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. â107
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Corporationâs effective tax rate may differ from the estimated statutory tax rates described above due to discrete items such as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets and liabilities, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items.âUnder the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. âThe provision for income taxes for the years indicated consisted of the following:ââââââââââYear Ended JuneÂ 30,Â (In Thousands)Â Â Â Â 2025Â Â Â Â 2024âââââââCurrent:Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Federalâ$ 709â$ 2,161StateâÂ  479âÂ  1,278ââÂ  1,188âÂ  3,439Deferred:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â FederalâÂ  948âÂ  (238)StateâÂ  482âÂ  (165)ââÂ  1,430âÂ  (403)Provision for income taxesâ$ 2,618â$ 3,036âThe Corporationâs tax expense from non-qualified stock-based compensation recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09 for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was $2,000 and $0, respectively.âThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to net income before income taxes as a result of the following differences for the years indicated:âââââââââââââââYear Ended JuneÂ 30,Â ââ2025â2024â(In Thousands)Â Â Â Â AmountÂ Â Â Â TaxÂ RateÂ Â Â Â AmountÂ Â Â Â TaxÂ RateÂ Â Â Â ââââââââââââFederal income tax at statutory rateâ$ 1,863Â  21.00%Â Â $ 2,181Â  21.00%Â Â State income tax, net of federal income tax benefitâÂ  759Â  8.55%Â Â Â  880Â  8.48%Â Â Changes in taxes resulting from:âÂ Â Â Â ââÂ Â Â Â ââBank-owned life insuranceâÂ  (39)Â  (0.44)%Â Â Â  (39)Â  (0.38)%Â Â Non-deductible expensesâÂ  28Â  0.31%Â Â Â  12Â  0.12%Â Â Non-deductible stock-based compensationâÂ  2Â  0.02%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Shortfall on stock-based compensationâÂ  1Â  0.02%Â Â Â  âÂ  â%Â Â Return to provision adjustmentââ 2â 0.03%Â Â â (1)â (0.01)%Â Â OtherâÂ  2Â  0.02%Â Â Â  3Â  0.02%Â Â Effective income taxâ$ 2,618Â  29.51%Â Â $ 3,036Â  29.23%Â Â â108

The Corporation analyzes the deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required based on the more-likely-than-not criteria that such assets will be realized principally through future taxable income or expense. This criteria takes into account the actual earnings and the estimates of future profitability. The Corporation may carryback net federal tax losses to the preceding five taxableÂ years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxableÂ years. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation had no federal and state net tax loss carryforwards. Based on managementâs consideration of historical and anticipated future income before income taxes, as well as the reversal period for the items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities, a valuation allowance was not considered necessary at June 30, 2025 and 2024 and management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will realize its deferred tax assets (liabilities).âRetained earnings at June 30, 2025 and 2024 include approximately $9.0 million (pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes) for which federal income tax of $3.1 million has not been provided. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for federal income tax purposes are later used for purposes other than for bad debt losses, including distribution in liquidation, they will be subject to federal income tax at the then-current corporate tax rate. If those amounts are not so used, they will not be subject to tax even in the event the Bank were to convert its charter from a thrift to a bank.âThe Corporation files income tax returns for the United States and California jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bankâs income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board (âCFTBâ) has audited the 109
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsBank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporationâs income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the CFTB completed a review of the Corporationâs income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal years 2023 and thereafter remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal years 2022 and thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities. In April 2025, the CFTB initiated a tax examination of the Corporationâs returns for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. As of June 30, 2025, all requested documents have been provided to the CFTB, and the Corporation is currently in discussions regarding the potential outcome of this examination. While the Corporation believes that its tax positions are fully supported, any adjustment resulting from ongoing audits or reviews could have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Corporation continues to evaluate the potential outcomes of the audits and related exposure to uncertain tax positions. âIt is the Corporationâs policy to record any penalties or interest charges arising from federal or state taxes as a component of income tax expense. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no tax penalties and no interest charges arising from federal or state taxes.ââNoteÂ 9: CapitalâThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. These capital regulations define the types of capital that qualify for meeting these requirements. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements may trigger certain mandatory actions, and possibly additional discretionary actions, by regulators. Such actions, if taken, could materially affect the Corporationâs financial condition and results of operations. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must comply with specific capital guidelines that are based on quantitative measures of the Bankâs assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Additionally, the Bankâs capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative assessments by regulators, who evaluate factors such as component composition, risk weightings, and other relevant considerations.âFor a bank holding company such as the Corporation with less than $3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis. The FRB expects the holding companyâs subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Corporation was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies at June 30, 2025, it would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.âThe Bank is subject to capital regulations that establish minimum required capital ratios for Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1 (âCET1â), Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital. Additionally, a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% is required above the minimum capital ratios for the CET1, Tier 1 risk-based, and total risk-based capital ratios. Failure to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 2.5% may result in limitations on the Corporationâs ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases, and pay discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.â110

The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" at June 30, 2025 under the regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (âOCCâ).âThe ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Provident Financial Holdings. Provident Financial Holdings and the Bank may not declare or pay cash dividends on or repurchase any of its shares of common stock, if the effect would cause stockholdersâ equity to be reduced below applicable regulatory capital maintenance requirements or if such declaration and payment would otherwise violate regulatory requirements.âGenerally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that are well-capitalized before and after the proposed distribution may make capital distributions during any calendarÂ year up to 100% of net income for theÂ year-to-date plus retained net income for the two precedingÂ years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or classified as troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed the net income-based limitations, it must obtain the FRBâs and OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a capital distribution with the FRB and OCC. The FRB or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Additional restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the Qualified Thrift Lender test. In fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank declared and paid cash dividends of $9.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, to its parent, Provident Financial Holdings.ââNoteÂ 10: Benefit PlansâThe Corporation has a 401(k) defined-contribution plan covering all employees meeting specific age and service requirements. Under the plan, employees may contribute to the plan from their pretax compensation up to the limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Corporation makes matching contributions up to 3% of a participantsâ pretax 111
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementscompensation. Participants vest immediately in their own contributions with 100% vesting in the Corporationâs contributions occurring after six years of credited service. The Corporationâs expense for the plan was approximately $276,000 and $303,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.âThe Corporation has a multi-year employment agreement and a post-retirement compensation agreement with one executive officer. In addition, the Corporation has a transition agreement with the previous executive officer (currently the non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors). At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the accrued liabilities of the post-retirement compensation agreements were $3.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively, with any costs (or recoveries) Â being accrued and expensed quarterly. In July 2024, the Corporation paid the post-retirement compensation benefit to the previous executive officer. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, the accrued expense (or recovery) for these liabilities was $178,000 and $85,000, respectively. The current obligation for these post-retirement benefits was fully funded consistent with contractual requirements and actuarially determined estimates of the total future obligation. The Corporation invests in BOLI to provide sufficient funding for these post-retirement obligations. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the total outstanding cash surrender value of the BOLI was $8.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, total BOLI non-taxable income, net of mortality cost, was $184,000 and $186,000, respectively.âEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (âESOPâ)The Corporation established an ESOP on JuneÂ 27, 1996 for all employees who are age 21 or older and have completed oneÂ year of service with the Corporation during which they have served a minimum of 1,000 hours.âThe Corporation recognizes compensation expense when the Corporation contributes funds to the ESOP for the purchase of the Corporationâs common stock to be allocated to the ESOP participants. The Corporation's contribution to the ESOP plan is discretionary. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, there were 40,000 shares for each year that were purchased in the open market to fulfill the annual discretionary allocation. Since the annual contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be estimated.âBenefits generally become 100% vested after six years of credited service. Vesting accelerates upon retirement, death or disability of the participant or in the event of a change in control of the Corporation. Forfeitures are reallocated among remaining participating employees in the same proportion as contributions. Benefits are payable upon death, retirement, early retirement, disability or separation from service.âThe net expense related to the ESOP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, was $592,000 and $540,000, respectively. Shares and cash contributions, if any, are allocated at the end of each calendar year. For the calendar years 2024 and 2023, the total ESOP allocation was 40,000 shares for each period. Â ââNoteÂ 11: Incentive PlansâAs of June 30, 2025, the Corporation had four share-based compensation plans: the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (â2022 Planâ); the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (â2013 Planâ); the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (â2010 Planâ); and the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (â2006 Planâ), collectively, the âPlansâ. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the compensation cost for the Plans was $543,000 and $240,000, respectively.âEquity Incentive Plans. The Corporation established the Plans, which were all approved by shareholders for directors, advisory directors, directors emeriti, officers and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiary. The 2022 Plan authorizes 175,000 stock options and 200,000 shares of restricted stock. The 2022 Plan also provides that no person may be granted more than 35,000 stock options or 30,000 shares of restricted stock in any one year. The 2013 Plan authorizes 300,000 stock options and 300,000 shares of restricted stock. The 2013 Plan also provides that no person may be granted more than 60,000 stock options or 45,000 shares of restricted stock in any one year. The 2010 Plan authorized 586,250 stock options and 288,750 shares of restricted stock. The 2006 Plan authorized 365,000 stock options and 185,000 shares of restricted stock. As of June 30, 2025, equity awards may be granted only from the 2022 Plan, while no new equity awards can be granted from the 2013 Plan, 2010 Plan and 2006 Plan.âEquity Incentive Plans - Stock Options. Under the Plans, options may not be granted at a price not less than the fair market value at the date of the grant. Options typically vest over a five-year or shorter period as long as the director, 112
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsadvisory director, director emeritus, officer or employee remains in service to the Corporation. The options are exercisable after vesting for up to the remaining term of the original grant. The maximum term of the options granted is 10 years.âThe fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions as of the grant date for the periods indicated. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from historical common stock closing prices for the prior 84 months. The expected dividend yield is based on the most recent quarterly dividend on an annualized basis. The expected term is based on the historical experience of all fully vested stock option grants and is reviewed annually. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury note rate with a term similar to the underlying stock option on the particular grant date.ââââââââÂ Â Â Â Fiscal 2025Â Â Â Â Fiscal 2024Â Â Â Â Expected volatilityÂ 23.4% - 23.6%â21.6% - 22.9%âWeighted average volatilityÂ  23.5%Â Â  22.5%Â Â Expected dividend yieldÂ 3.4% - 3.7%â 4.5%Â Â Expected term (in years)Â  7.3Â  7.4Â Risk-free interest rateÂ 4.3% - 4.5%â 4.3%Â Â âAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were 45,000 options and 77,000 options available for future grants under the 2022 Plan, respectively. âThe following tables summarize the stock option activity in the Plans during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.âââââââââââââÂ Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Â ââÂ Â Â Â WeightedÂ Â Â Â ââââââWeightedâAverageâAggregateââââAverageâRemainingâIntrinsicââââExerciseâContractualâValueOptionsâSharesâPriceâTermÂ (Years)â($000)Outstanding at JuneÂ 30,Â 2023Â  434,500â$ 16.04Â Â Â âÂ Â Â GrantedÂ  98,000â$ 12.44Â Â Â âÂ Â Â ExercisedÂ  ââ$ âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â ForfeitedÂ  (5,000)â$ 14.52Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Expiredâ (47,500)â$ 15.71âââââOutstanding at JuneÂ 30,Â 2024Â  480,000â$ 15.35Â  3.29â$ âVested and expected to vest at JuneÂ 30,Â 2024Â  475,950â$ 16.36Â  3.25â$ âExercisable at JuneÂ 30,Â 2024Â  355,000â$ 16.18Â  1.14â$ ââââââââââââOutstanding at JuneÂ 30,Â 2024Â  480,000â$ 15.35Â Â Â âÂ Â Â GrantedÂ  32,000â$ 15.72Â Â Â âÂ Â Â ExercisedÂ  ââ$ âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â ForfeitedÂ  (41,000)â$ 19.31Â Â Â âÂ Â Â Expiredâ (242,000)â$ 14.59âââââOutstanding at JuneÂ 30,Â 2025Â  229,000â$ 15.51Â  6.99â$ 20Vested and expected to vest at JuneÂ 30,Â 2025Â  226,450â$ 15.51Â  7.00â$ 18Exercisable at JuneÂ 30,Â 2025Â  82,000â$ 19.10Â  3.87â$ 10âAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there was $266,000 and $231,000 of unrecognized compensation expense, respectively, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements with respect to stock options issued under the Plans. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.7 years and 3.5 years, respectively. The forfeiture rate during both fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 15%, and was calculated by using the historical forfeiture experience of all fully vested stock option grants which is reviewed annually.âEquity Incentive Plans â Restricted Stock.

This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years and 3.5 years, respectively. Similar to stock options, a forfeiture rate of 15% was applied to the restricted stock compensation expense calculations in both fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the fair value of shares vested and distributed was $315,000 and $24,000, respectively.ââNoteÂ 12: Earnings Per ShareâBasic earnings per share (âEPSâ) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Corporation.âAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were outstanding options to purchase 229,000 shares and 480,000 shares of the Corporationâs common stock, of which 99,000 shares and 382,000 shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS computation as their effect was anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were outstanding restricted stock awards of 144,650 shares and 176,650 shares, respectively.â114

These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the Corporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.âThe Corporation conducts a portion of its operations in leased facilities and has maintenance contracts under non-cancelable agreements classified as operating or finance leases, which include leases recorded under ASC 842 on liabilities for future lease obligations as well as assets representing the right-to-use the underlying leased assets (See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). âThe following is a schedule of the Corporationâs lease and operating commitments:ââââââÂ Â Â Â AmountYear Ending JuneÂ 30,Â â(InÂ Thousands)ââââ2026â$ 2,1412027âÂ  1,1532028âÂ  6412029âÂ  1412030âÂ  11ThereafterâÂ  âTotal minimum payments requiredâ$ 4,087âFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the lease and operating commitment expense was approximately $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.â115
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Bank sold single-family mortgage loans to unrelated third parties with standard representation and warranty provisions in the ordinary course of its business activities. Under these provisions, the Bank is required to repurchase any previously sold loan for which the representations or warranties of the Bank prove to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. In the event of a borrower default or fraud, pursuant to a breached representation or warranty, the Bank may be required to reimburse the investor for any losses suffered. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Bank did not repurchase any loans. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank maintained a non-contingent recourse liability related to these representations and warranties of $17,000 and $18,000, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintained a recourse liability of $6,000 and $8,000, respectively, for loans sold to the FHLB â San Francisco under the MPF program.âIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into contracts with third parties under which the third parties provide services on behalf of the Corporation. In many of these contracts, the Corporation agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnity vary from contract to contract and the amount of the indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined. The Corporation also enters into other contracts and agreements; such as, loan sale agreements, litigation settlement agreements, confidentiality agreements, loan servicing agreements, leases and subleases, among others, in which the Corporation agrees to indemnify third parties for acts by the Corporationâs agents, assignees and/or sub-lessees, and employees. Due to the nature of these indemnification provisions, the Corporation cannot calculate its aggregate potential exposure.ââNoteÂ 14: Derivative and Other Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet RisksâThe Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale commitments to third parties and option contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporationâs exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation had commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment of $6.1 million and $9.4 million, respectively.âThe following table provides information at the dates indicated regarding undisbursed loan funds, undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of credit with the Corporation and commitments to originate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below:âââââââââÂ Â Â Â JuneÂ 30,Â Commitmentsâ2025â2024(In Thousands)Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Undisbursed loan funds â Construction loansâ$ 529â$ 435Undisbursed loan funds â Single-family loans(1)âÂ  53âÂ  âUndisbursed lines of credit â Mortgage loansââ 8ââ âUndisbursed lines of credit â Commercial business loansâÂ  2,208âÂ  2,936Undisbursed lines of credit â Consumer loansâÂ  320âÂ  341Commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investmentâÂ  6,061âÂ  9,387Totalâ$ 9,179â$ 13,099â(1)Consists of undisbursed loan funds of previously reported construction loans that were converted to single-family loans based on their contractual terms.âââNoteÂ 15: Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsâThe Corporation adopted ASC 820, âFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,â and elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825, âFinancial Instrumentsâ on single-family loans originated for sale. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 825 permits entities to 116
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementselect to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the âFair Value Optionâ) at specified election dates. At each subsequent reporting date, an entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items in earnings for which the fair value option has been elected. The objective of the Fair Value Option is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The Corporation elected the fair value option on loans held for investment that were previously originated for sale, as well as for other equity investments.âThe following table describes the difference at the dates indicated between the fair value and the unpaid loan principal balance and other equity investment base cost:âââââââââââââââââââââââââââNetââââUnpaid PrincipalâUnrealized(In Thousands)Â Â Â Â FairÂ ValueÂ Â Â Â or Base CostÂ Â Â Â (Loss) GainAs of JuneÂ 30,Â 2025:âââââââââLoans held for investment, at fair valueâ$ 1,018â$ 1,158â$ (140)Other equity investments, at fair valueâ$ 730â$ ââ$ 730ââââââââââAs of JuneÂ 30,Â 2024:âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Â Loans held for investment, at fair valueâ$ 1,047â$ 1,200â$ (153)Other equity investments, at fair valueâ$ 540â$ ââ$ 540âASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:Level 1-Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date.Level 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include the use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.Level 3-Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporationâs estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.âASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation.âThe Corporationâs financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale, loans held for investment at fair value, other equity investments and interest-only strips; while loans with individually evaluated allowances and mortgage servicing assets (âMSAâ) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.âInvestment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and private issue CMO. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the private issue CMO (Level 3).âLoans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale. The fair value is determined by management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan, in addition to the quoted secondary-market prices which account for the interest rate characteristics of each loan (Level 3).â117
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsLoans with individually evaluated allowances that are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or of the collateral pledged. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The fair value of a loan with an individually evaluated allowance is determined based on the discounted cash flow or current appraised value of the underlying collateral. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on managementâs historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or managementâs expertise and knowledge of the collateral. For commercial real estate loans with an individually evaluated allowance, the fair value is derived from the appraised value of its collateral. Loans with an individually evaluated allowance are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above (Level 3). This loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), but rather as a component in determining the overall adequacy of the ACL. These adjustments to the estimated fair value of loans with an individually evaluated allowance may result in increases or decreases to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses recorded in current earnings.âThe fair value of other equity investments is derived from quoted prices in active markets for the equivalent or similar investments (Level 2).âThe Corporation uses the amortization method for its MSA, which amortizes the MSA in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assesses the MSA for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the MSA is derived using the present value method; which includes a third partyâs prepayment projections of similar instruments, weighted average coupon rates, estimated servicing costs and discount interest rates (Level 3).âThe fair value of interest-only strips is derived using the same assumptions that are used to value the related MSA (Level 3).âThe Corporationâs valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Corporationâs valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.âThe following fair value hierarchy tables present information at the dates indicated about the Corporationâs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:ââââââââââââââââFairÂ ValueÂ MeasurementÂ atÂ JuneÂ 30,Â 2025 Using:(In Thousands)Â Â Â Â LevelÂ 1Â Â Â Â LevelÂ 2Â Â Â Â LevelÂ 3Â Â Â Â TotalAssets:ââââââââââââInvestment securities - available for sale:ââââââââââââU.S. government agency MBSâ$ ââ$ 1,082â$ ââ$ 1,082U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBSâÂ  ââÂ  446âÂ  ââÂ  446Private issue CMOâÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  79âÂ  79Investment securities - available for saleâÂ  ââÂ  1,528âÂ  79âÂ  1,607âââââââââââââLoans held for investment, at fair valueâÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  1,018âÂ  1,018Other equity investments, at fair valueââ âââ 730ââ âââ 730Interest-only stripsâÂ  ââÂ  ââÂ  6âÂ  6Total assetsâ$ ââ$ 2,258â$ 1,103â$ 3,361âââââââââââââLiabilities:â$ ââ$ ââ$ ââ$ âTotal liabilitiesâ$ ââ$ ââ$ ââ$ ââ118

A decrease to the unobservable input would have the opposite effect. Significant changes in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.âThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporationâs assets and liabilities include the following: prepayment rates, discount rates and broker quotes, among others. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The various unobservable inputs used to determine valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, there were no significant changes to the Corporation's valuation techniques and inputs that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.ââ120

For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i)Â discounting the estimated future cash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which such loans would be made to borrowers, or (ii)Â quoted market prices.âInvestment securitiesÂ - held to maturity: The investment securitiesÂ - held to maturity consist of U.S. SBA securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO. For the U.S. SBA securities and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement (Level 2).âFHLBÂ â San Francisco stock is carried at cost/par value and represents its fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock.âDeposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based upon observable inputs, including rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand.âBorrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on such borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.âThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation generally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily utilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. âWhile the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a 121
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsdifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For the fiscalÂ year ended June 30, 2025, there were no significant changes to the Corporationâs valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.ââNoteÂ 16: Revenue From Contracts With CustomersâIn accordance with ASC 606, revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to the customer in exchange for the consideration the Corporation expects to be entitled to receive. The largest portion of the Corporationâs revenue is from interest income, which is not in the scope of ASC 606. All the Corporationâs revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606 is recognized in non-interest income.âIf a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Corporation recognizes revenue as it satisfies a performance obligation. Payments from customers are generally collected at the time services are rendered, monthly, or quarterly. For contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is either earned at a point in time or revenue is earned over time. Examples of revenue earned at a point in time are automated teller machine ("ATM") transaction fees, wire transfer fees, overdraft fees and interchange fees. Revenue is primarily based on the number and type of transactions that are generally derived from transactional information accumulated by the Corporationâs systems and is recognized immediately as the transactions occur or upon providing the service to complete the customer's transaction. The Corporation is generally the principal in these contracts, with the exception of interchanges fees, in which case the Corporation is acting as the agent and records revenue net of expenses paid to the principal. Examples of revenue earned over time, which generally occur on a monthly basis, are deposit account maintenance fees, investment advisory fees, merchant revenue, trust and investment management fees and safe deposit box fees. Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by its systems or those of third-parties and is recognized as the related transactions occur or services are rendered to the customer.âDisaggregation of Revenue:âThe following table includes the Corporation's non-interest income disaggregated by type of services for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:ââââââââââYear Ended JuneÂ 30,Â Type of ServicesÂ Â Â Â 2025Â Â Â Â 2024(In Thousands)Â âÂ Â Â âÂ Â Loan servicing and other fees(1)â$ 419â$ 337Deposit account feesââ 1,112ââ 1,154Card and processing feesââ 1,265ââ 1,384Other(2)âÂ  735âÂ  1,066Total non-interest incomeâ$ 3,531â$ 3,941â(1)Not within the scope of ASC 606.(2)Includes income on BOLI of $184 thousand and $186 thousand, net loss on sale of loans of $60 thousand and $66 thousand and net unrealized gain on other equity investments of $190 thousand and $540 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which are not within the scope of ASC 606.âFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, substantially all the Corporationâs revenues within the scope of ASC 606 were for performance obligations satisfied at a specified date.âRevenue recognized within the scope of ASC 606:âDeposit account fees: Fees are earned on the Bank's deposit accounts for various products offered to or services performed for the Bank's customers. These fees include business account fees, non-sufficient fund fees, ATM fees and others. Fees are recognized concurrently with the related event and are recorded on a daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of service.â122
Table of ContentsPROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsCard and processing fees: Debit interchange income represents fees earned when a debit card issued by the Bank is used. The Bank earns interchange fees from cardholder transactions through a third-party payment network. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are earned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholders' debit card. Certain expenses directly associated with the debit cards are recorded on a net basis with the interchange income.âOther fees: Includes asset management fees, stop payment fees, wire services fees, safe deposit box fees and other fees earned on other services, such as merchant services or occasional non-recurring type services, are recognized at the time of the event or the applicable billing cycle. Asset management fees are variable, since they are based on the underlying portfolio value, which is subject to market conditions and amounts invested by customers through a third-party provider. Asset management fees are recognized over the period that services are provided and when the portfolio values can be determined or reasonably estimated at the end of each month. These fees are recognized concurrently with the related event and are recorded on daily, monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the type of services.âNoteÂ 17: Segment ReportingâThe Corporation operates as a single reportable segment, providing a broad range of banking and financial services to individuals, businesses, and institutional clients. These services include primarily commercial and consumer lending, deposit products, and to a lesser extent, loan servicing and wealth management services. The commercial and consumer lending primarily consists of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage lending and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, other mortgage and consumer lending. The Corporationâs chief operating decision maker (âCODMâ) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM relies on the Senior Management Committee, which includes the Senior Vice President â Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President â Chief Lending Officer, Senior Vice President â Retail Banking, Senior Vice President â Single Family, and others, to provide detailed financial and operational reports. The CODM regularly evaluates the financial performance of the Corporation and allocates resources accordingly.
