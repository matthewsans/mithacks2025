PART IV, ITEM 3
The Registrant anticipates higher sales and higher
net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, as compared to net sales and operating results for the prior year. However,
inasmuch as the Registrant has not yet completed its financial statements, at this time the Registrant is unable to definitively quantify
its results of operations.
