BUSINESS OVERVIEW We were incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our original business plan was to operate photo booth rentals. On April 3, 2015, a change in control occurred by virtue of our company’s largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split adjusted) of our common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represented 71.77% of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of our company’s Board of Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of our company.  On April 16, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held. Our Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77% of our issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015. Effective April 29, 2015 we changed our name to America Resources Exploration Inc. by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name. On June 10, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby we issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the “Leases”). The acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement was completed on June 1, 2015. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of our company’s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns our company’s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at $160,000 and valuing our company’s stock at $0.04 per share. At the completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the oil and gas industry. On June 11, 2015, we entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests (“ORR’s”) as set out in the table below. From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of such oil and gas leases and ORR’s, whereby we issued a total of 6,500 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zheng. Assignment DateName of The PropertyType of PropertyLocationJune 11th, 2015Ellis CountyOverriding Royalty Int.OklahomaJune 11th, 2015Hemphill CountyOverriding Royalty IntTexasJune 11th, 2015Madison CountyWellbore InterestTexasJune 11th, 2015Shelby CountyWellbore InterestTexasJune 11th, 2015Emergy CountyLease PurchaseUtah On August 13, 2015 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereby our company acquired a 78% net revenue interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78% net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas.  4Table of Contents On January 20, 2016, we changed our name to PetroGas Company, by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name. In addition, we amended our Articles of Incorporation for a reverse stock split by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio one (1) new for one hundred (100) old shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by our directors and shareholders holding 68.65% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on January 13, 2016 and the reverse stock split became effective with FINRA on March 7, 2016. The change of name resulted in a change of trading symbol to “PTCO”. On September 13, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. Our Board of Directors approved the Amendment on July 21, 2017 and Shareholders holding 75.95% of our company’s shares approved the Amendment via written consent executed on July 21, 2017, with an effective date of October 5, 2017. On February 20, 2019 a majority of our shareholders and our board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) new for 100 old basis. The reverse split was approved by FINRA with an effective date of March 19, 2019. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 30,099,230 to 300,993 shares of common stock. Our authorized capital remained unchanged. Our principal executive offices are located at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 4100, Houston, Texas 77056. Our telephone number is (832) 899-8597. We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. We hold a 94% interest in Seabourn Oil Company, LLC, a Texas LLC. CURRENT INVESTMENTS On June 12, 2015, we acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford Shale formation - the Jane Burns “C” (“Burns”), the Theo Rogers “C”, and the Theo Rogers “A” & “D” (“Rogers”) Leases. We acquired a 99.5% working interest (74.625% net revenue interest) in each lease. The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas. The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although our company’s management and industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that our company could double or triple previous production on these wells, depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture. On November 30, 2016, we acquired various royalty interests in Texas for $10,485. On December 14, 2016, we acquired two oil and gas leases in Ohio for $2,705. On January 1, 2017, our company acquired the lease for three oil and gas properties for $4,975. On February 6, 2024, we acquired an oil and gas lease in Tarrant County, Texas. The lease covers 12.1 acres of land located in the Robert R Ramey Survey and is for a period of 1.5 years. Future Operations We are actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones. We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come.  5Table of Contents In the current climate, our company believes that there are a very large number of oil & gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and that we can strategically position our company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating shareholder value. We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil. Lease Data Burns Lease Acreage: 160 Working Interest: 99.5%; Net Revenue Interest: 74.625% Depth of wells is from 3,550 to 3,639 ft. Field: Kyote; Zone: Olmos “D” Reservoir. Inventory: 2 pumping units, 2 oil tanks, 1 separator, 2 wells w/tubing & rods downhole, 2 downhole pumps in wells, 3 packers in wells; 2 wells w/electrical connection; 2 propane motors; 1 propane tank; 1 unused well head. Rogers Lease Acreage: 355 Working Interest: 99.5%; Net Revenue Interest: 74.625% Depth of wells is from 3,518 to 3,590 ft. Field: Kyote; Zone: Olmos “D” Reservoir. Inventory: 1 pumping unit, 1 oil tank (400 bbls), 1 well w/tubing & rods downhole, 1 downhole pump in well, 1 well w/electrical connection. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Oil and Gas Operations If our exploration and development programs prove unsuccessful, we may not be able to continue operations. An investment in our company should be considered highly speculative due to the nature of our involvement in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Oil and gas exploration involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Exploratory drilling is subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost to drill, complete and operate wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors including unexpected drilling conditions, abnormal pressures, equipment failures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, sour gas releases, fires, spills or other accidents, as well as weather conditions, compliance with governmental requirements, delays in receiving governmental approvals or permits, unexpected environmental issues and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. Our inability to drill wells that produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  6Table of Contents Future oil and gas acquisitions or exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after exploration, drilling, operating and other costs. Completion of wells does not ensure a profit on the investment or recovery of exploration, drilling, completion and operating costs. Drilling hazards or environmental damage could greatly increase the cost of operations, and various field operating conditions may adversely affect production. Adverse conditions include delays in obtaining governmental approvals or consents, shut-ins of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions, insufficient storage or transportation capacity or other geological and mechanical conditions. Fluctuations in commodity prices could have a material impact on our revenues, which would affect our profitability. Commodity price risk related to conventional crude oil prices could become our most significant market risk exposure if we achieve oil and natural gas production. Crude oil prices are influenced by such worldwide factors as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries actions, political events and supply and demand fundamentals. At this time, we cannot accurately predict these fluctuations because we do not know when we will commence generating revenues from our oil and gas operations. Furthermore, we cannot estimate, at this time, the impact of commodity price fluctuations until we can predict the level of revenues. Application, interpretation and enforcement of government tax and other legislation is inconsistent making it difficult for us to ensure that we are compliant which could lead to penalties. The tax environment in the United States is subject to change, inconsistent application, interpretation and enforcement. Non-compliance with US laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of penalties and interest. We intend to make every effort to conform to these laws and regulations. However, our interpretations and those of our advisors may not be the same as those of government officials, which could lead to penalties and interest. We face competition which could adversely affect our ability to significantly penetrate the oil and gas market in the U.S., which may make it difficult to attain profitability. The oil and gas market in the U.S. is highly competitive. Most of the competitors are major international energy industry operators. These competitors have various advantages over us, including: -Substantially greater financial resources, which gives them greater access to the types of distressed properties that we are targeting and flexibility when developing their exploration and drilling programs; -greater recognition in the industry, which influences a potential partners’ decision to participate in programs; -larger operations, which provides economies of scale and operating efficiencies not available to us; -longer operating histories; and -more established relationships with strategic partners. We may be unable to successfully compete with these established competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to acquire additional properties and thus impact our ability to generate revenue. Compliance, interpretation and enforcement with evolving environmental laws and regulations may impact our expenses in a negative manner, which would directly impact our profit margins. Extensive national, regional and local environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. will affect our operations. These laws and regulations set various standards regulating certain aspects of health and environmental quality which provide for user fees, penalties and other liabilities for the violation of these standards and establish, in some circumstances, obligations to remediate current and former facilities and off-site locations. We believe we are currently in compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations. However, as new environmental laws and legislation are enacted and the old laws are repealed, interpretation, application and enforcement of the laws may become inconsistent. Compliance in the future could require significant expenditures, which would directly impact our profit margins. Drilling, exploring for and producing oil is a high risk activity with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our drilling, exploration and production activities. These activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in economic oil production or increases in reserves. Many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled development projects, including:  7Table of Contents ·decline in oil prices;·compliance with governmental regulations, which may include limitations on hydraulic fracturing, access to water or the discharge of greenhouse gases;·inadequate capital resources;·inability to attract and retain qualified personnel;·unavailability or high cost of drilling and completion equipment, services or materials;·unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents;·adverse weather conditions;·surface access restrictions;·mechanical difficulties. Oil prices are volatile, and a decline in oil prices could significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial commitments. Our revenues, profitability and cash flow will depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil. The markets for this commodity are volatile, and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth. Prices for oil fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as: ·domestic and foreign supply of oil;·domestic and foreign consumer demand for oil;·overall United States and global economic conditions;·price and availability of alternative fuels;·governmental regulations; ·technological advances affecting oil consumption. Further, oil prices continue to be volatile. Advanced drilling and completion technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have resulted in increased investment by oil and gas producers in developing U.S. shale gas and, more recently, tight oil projects. The results of higher investment in the exploration for and production of oil and gas and other factors, such as global economic and financial conditions discussed below, may cause the price of oil to fall. Lower oil prices may not only cause our revenues to decrease but also may reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically. Continue depressed oil prices have resulted is us having to impair our estimated proved reserves and has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if oil prices significantly decline for an extended period of time, we may, among other things, be unable to have any borrowing capacity, repay future debt or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can affect the value of our common stock. Future economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. and other world economies continue to experience the after-effects of a global recession and credit market crisis. More volatility may occur before a sustainable growth rate is achieved either domestically or globally. Even if such growth rate is achieved, such a rate may be lower than the U.S. and international economies have experienced in the past. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower, future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our oil production and lower commodity prices, and consequently reduce our revenues, cash flows from operations and our profitability. We are subject to complex governmental laws and regulations that may adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business. Our oil drilling, production and gathering operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and approvals from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations apply to our operations. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including any evolving interpretation and enforcement by government authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  8Table of Contents Environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our oil operations due to the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and generated wastes, the occurrence of air emissions and water discharges from work-related activities and the legacy of pollution from historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. We may incur joint and several or strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in connection with spills, leaks or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities, some of which have been used for exploration, production or development activities for many years and by third parties not under our control. In particular, the number of private, civil lawsuits involving hydraulic fracturing has risen in recent years. Since late 2009, multiple private lawsuits alleging ground water contamination have been filed in the U.S. against oil and gas companies, primarily by landowners who leased oil and gas rights to defendants, or by landowners who live close to areas where hydraulic fracturing has taken place. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Our business requires significant capital expenditures and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through a combination of private or public equity financings. We may not be able to obtain equity financing on favorable terms or at all. The failure to obtain financing could cause us to scale back our exploration and development operations, which in turn could lead to loss of properties. Currently, all of our properties are located in eleven (11) counties, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having our production concentrated in a small area. All of our properties are concentrated in fourteen (14) counties comprised of seven (7) counties in Texas (Atascosa, Frio, Hemphill, Madison, Shelby, Callahan and Roberts Counties), four (4) counties in Oklahoma (Ellis, Payne, Cleveland, and Harper Counties), one (1) county in Utah (Emergy County), and two (2) counties in Ohio (Monroe and Washington Counties). As a result of this concentration, we are disproportionately exposed to the natural decline of production from these fields as well as the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells, which could be caused by significant governmental regulation, transportation capacity constraints, curtailments of production, service delays, natural disasters or other events that impact this area. Market conditions or transportation and infrastructure impediments may hinder our access to oil markets or delay our production or sales. Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil processing and transportation services and infrastructure may hinder our access to oil markets or delay our production or sales. The availability of a ready market for our oil production depends on a number of factors, including market demand and the proximity of any producing wells that we may operate in the future to pipelines or trucking and rail terminal facilities. In addition, the amount of oil that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. As a result, we may not be able to sell, or may have to transport by more expensive means, the oil that we produce, or we may be required to shut in oil wells or delay initial production until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are available. Any significant curtailment in gathering system, transportation, pipeline capacity or significant delay in construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  9Table of Contents The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, materials, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our drilling and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of equipment, oilfield services and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling and completion crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production will increase the demand for oilfield services, and the costs of these services may increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. If the availability of equipment, crews, materials and services in counties in which our properties are located is particularly severe, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected because our properties are located solely in those counties. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, and most of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours. We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties, marketing oil and securing equipment and skilled personnel. Most of our competitors are major and large independent oil and gas companies that have financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to develop and operate our current projects, acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions and in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing oil and raising additional capital. Operating hazards or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities, for which we do not have insurance. The oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of gas, oil or well fluids, fires, surface and subsurface pollution and contamination, and releases of toxic gas. The occurrence of one of the above may result in injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, environmental damage and remediation and/or governmental investigations and penalties. We do not currently have insurance and if we do acquire insurance at the commencement of operations, then consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, we expect that our insurance policies will provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences. Our insurance, when acquired, might be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years. Insurance costs are expected to continue to increase over the next few years, and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our results are subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could be negatively impacted in the future as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal variations in oil prices, variations in levels of production, if an when production commences, and the completion of development projects. Risks Relating to an Investment in our Securities If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted.  10Table of Contents In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, or disclosure of our public accounting firm’s attestation to or report on management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. For example, on January 30, 2009, the SEC adopted rules requiring companies to provide their financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language, or XBRL. We currently have to comply with these rules. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. Because of the early stage of development and the nature of our business, our securities are considered highly speculative. Our securities must be considered highly speculative, generally because of the nature of our business and the early stage of its development. We have not generated any revenues nor have we realized a profit from our -operations to date and there is little likelihood that we will generate any revenues or realize any profits in the short term. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon our ability to market the products developed under our licensing agreement and to source other acquisitions in the industry we have chosen either additional technologies or exploration projects. Since we have not generated any revenues, we will have to raise additional monies through the sale of our equity securities or debt in order to continue our business operations. We may, in the future, issue additional common shares that would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value. The future issuance of common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common shares issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common shares for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the common shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common shares. Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they are considered penny stocks and are subject to the penny stock rules thereby potentially limiting the liquidity of our shares. Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on NASD broker-dealers who make a market in “penny stocks”. A penny stock generally includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our shares are quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace. NASD broker-dealers who act as market makers for our shares generally facilitate purchases and sales of our shares. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor” (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt.  11Table of Contents In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer’s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks. Our common stock may experience extreme rises or declines in price, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price paid. Our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including (but not necessarily limited to): (i) the trading volume of our shares; (ii) the number of securities analysts, market-makers and brokers following our common stock; (iii) changes in, or failure to achieve, financial estimates by securities analysts; (iv) actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; (v) conditions or trends in our business industries; (vi) announcements by us of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (vii) additions or departures of key personnel; (viii) sales of our common stock; and (ix) general stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-trading and particularly, microcap companies. Investors may have difficulty reselling shares of our common stock, either at or above the price they paid for our stock, or even at fair market value. The stock markets often experience significant price and volume changes that are not related to the operating performance of individual companies, and because our common stock is thinly traded it is particularly susceptible to such changes. These broad market changes may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of how well we perform as a company. In addition, there is a history of securities class action litigation following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. Although there is no such shareholder litigation currently pending or threatened against the Company, such a suit against us could result in the incursion of substantial legal fees, potential liabilities and the diversion of management’s attention and resources from our business. Moreover, and as noted below, our shares are currently traded on the OTC Pink Marketplace and, further, are subject to the penny stock regulations. Price fluctuations in such shares are particularly volatile and subject to manipulation by market-makers, short-sellers and option traders. A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, or convertible debt instruments, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY We have implemented cybersecurity risk management procedures, in accordance with our risk profile and business size. We rely on our information technology to operate our business. As such, we have policies and processes designed to protect our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, and resolve issues in a timely manner in the event of a cybersecurity threat or incident. We have designed our business applications to minimize the impact that cybersecurity incidents could have on our business and have identified back-up systems where appropriate. We seek to further mitigate cybersecurity risks through a combination of monitoring and detection activities, use of anti-malware applications, employee training, quality audits and communication and reporting structures, among other processes. We have a trained group of people to carry out the activities of monitoring and detection of cybersecurity threats and respond to any cybersecurity threats or incidents. The Head of IT department is responsible for oversight of cybersecurity risks and addressing potential cybersecurity risks to business programs, employees, clients, vendors and partners. The Head of IT Department reports to our Chief Executive Officer who reports to the Audit Committee at the board-level, as appropriate. As of March 31, 2025, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.  12Table of Contents  ITEM 2.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are listed for quotation on the Pink sheets of the OTC Markets under the trading symbol “PTCO”. Trading in stocks quoted on the Pink Sheets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects. Pink Sheet securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Pink Sheet securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Pink Sheet issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. Holders As of June 10, 2025, we had 9 shareholders of record of our common stock with 22,996,680 shares of common stock outstanding. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. Equity Compensation Plans Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the company has limited cash resources at this time, it may issue shares or options to or enter into obligations that are convertible into shares of common stock with its employees and consultants as payment for services or as discretionary bonuses. Recent Sales of unregistered securities None Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There were no repurchases of common stock for the year ended March 31, 2025.  ITEM 6.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “we believe,” “management believes” and similar language. Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere in this current report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The factors listed in the section captioned “Risk Factors,” as well as any cautionary language in this current report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events after the date of this current report on Form 10-K.  14Table of Contents Overview We intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. Our company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated revenue from operations, we will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management of our company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable our company to reach profitable operations. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our company’s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and accompanying notes appended thereto that are included in this annual report. Results of Operations     Year  Year     Ended  Ended     March 31,  March 31,     2025  2024  Changes           Operating Expenses $24,692  $38,040  $(13,348 )Other Income (Expense)  $33,670  $(52,548) $86,218 Net Income (Loss) $8,978  $(90,588 ) $99,566  We did not recognize any revenue during the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The Company recognized net income of $8,978 during the year ended March 31, 2025 while incurred net loss of $90,588 during the year ended March 31, 2024.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going ConcernThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statement, the Company have an accumulated deficit of $(142,283,195), and a negative working capital of $(790,250). The Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from related and unaffiliated parties to execute its plans and continue operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Going Concern Uncertainty – See also Going Concern Uncertainty explanatory paragraph aboveAs described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had no significant revenues from the inception, and has accumulated deficit, and a working capital deficiency. The Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from related party and unaffiliated parties to execute its plans and continue operations These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. We determined the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding the Company’s available capital and the risk of bias in management’s judgments and assumptions in their determination. The procedures performed to address the matter included.  ·We inquired of executive officers, and key members of management, of the Company regarding factors that would have an impact on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, ·We evaluated management’s plan for addressing the adverse effects of the conditions identified, including assessing the reasonableness of forecasted information and underlying assumptions by comparing to actual results of prior periods and actual results achieved to date, and utilizing our knowledge of the entity, its business and management in considering liquidity needs and the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow, ·We assessed the possibility of raising additional debt or credit, ·We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of disclosures in the financial statements.  /S/ Boladale LawalBoladale Lawal & CO (PCAOB ID 6993) We have served as the Company's auditor since 2024Lagos, NigeriaJune 30, 2025  F-2Table of Contents  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Stockholders ofPETROGAS COMPANY. Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Petrogas Company (the ‘Company’) as of March 31, 2024, and 2023, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going ConcernThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $142,292,173, net loss of $90,558 and a negative working capital of $715,648. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. /s/Olayinka OyebolaOLAYINKA OYEBOLA & CO. (5968)(Chartered Accountants)Lagos, Nigeria We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.June 24, 2024  F-3Table of Contents PETROGAS COMPANYBALANCE SHEETS   March 31,  March 31,   2025  2024 ASSETS      Total Current Assets $-  $-          TOTAL ASSETS $-  $-          LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT        Current Liabilities        Bank indebtedness $322  $322 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  18,818   24,068 Accrued interest  347,896   297,986 Advances from related party  173,283   143,341 Convertible promissory notes, net of debt discount  200,286   200,286 Promissory note  6,962   6,962 Promissory note - related party  42,683   42,683 Total Current Liabilities  790,250   715,648          Asset retirement obligations  -   83,580    -   83,580          TOTAL LIABILITIES  790,250   799,228          SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT        Common stock: 300,000,000 authorized; $0.001 par value 22,996,680 shares issued and outstanding  22,997   22,997 Additional paid in capital  141,469,948   141,469,948 Accumulated deficit  (142,283,195)  (142,292,173)TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT  (790,250)  (799,228)         TOTAL LIABILITIES & SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT $-  $-  The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-4Table of Contents PETROGAS COMPANYSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS   Year Ended   March 31,   2025  2024        OPERATING EXPENSES      Oil exploration cost $-  $900 Professional fees  24,692   37,140 Total operating expenses  24,692   38,040          Loss from Operations  (24,692)  (38,040)         OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)        Gain on asset retirement obligations  83,580   - Interest expense  (49,910)  (52,548) Total other income (expense)  33,670   (52,548)          NET INCOME (LOSS) $8,978 $(90,588)         BASIC NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE $0.00 $(0.00)DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE $0.00  $-          BASIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING  22,996,680   22,455,001 DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING  43,025,218   -  The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-5Table of Contents PETROGAS COMPANYSTATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICITFOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025 AND 2024   Common Stock  Additional     Total   Number of Shares  Amount  Paid inCapital  AccumulatedDeficit  Stockholder'sDeficit                 Balance - March 31, 2023  21,048,440  $21,048  $141,452,414  $(142,201,585) $(728,123)Issuance of common stock for note conversion  1,948,240   1,949   17,534   -   19,483 Net loss  -   -   -   (90,588)  (90,588)Balance - March 31, 2024  22,996,680  $22,997  $141,469,948  $(142,292,173) $(799,228)Net income  -   -   -   8,978  8,978Balance - March 31, 2025  22,996,680  $22,997  $141,469,948  $(142,283,195) $(790,250) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-6Table of Contents PETROGAS COMPANYSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS   Year Ended   March 31,   2025  2024        CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES      Net Income (Loss) $8,978 $(90,588)Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash used in operating activities:        Gain on asset retirement obligations  (83,580)  - Changes in operating assets and liabilities:        Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  (5,250)  (4,126)Accrued interest  49,910   52,547 Net cash used in Operating Activities  (29,942)  (42,167)         CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES        Advances from related party  29,942   42,167 Net cash provided by Financing Activities  29,942   42,167          Net changes in cash and cash equivalents  -   - Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period  -   - Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $-  $-          Supplemental cash flow information        Cash paid for interest  -   - Cash paid for taxes  -   -          Non-cash transactions:        Conversion of convertible notes into common shares $-  $19,483  The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-7Table of Contents PETROGAS COMPANYNOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMARCH 31, 2025 NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PERSENTATION Organization and nature of business PetroGas Company (Formerly America Resources Exploration Inc. (the “Company”)), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 24, 2014. The Company was incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April 17, 2015. Subsequently, on January 20, 2016, the Company changed its name to PetroGas Company. On June 12, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain oil & gas properties. All share amounts in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this stock split. NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN The Company had no significant revenues from the inception through March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $142,283,195. We will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans. NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. The estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the Company’s assets. Any estimates during the period have had an immaterial effect on earnings. Oil and Gas Properties – Full Cost Method The Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on nonproducing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to operations. The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable oil and gas reserves.  F-8Table of Contents The costs associated with unevaluated and unproved properties, initially excluded from the amortization base, relate to unproved leasehold acreage, wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of the existence of proved reserves, together with capitalized interest costs for these projects. Unproved leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well once a determination of the existence of proved reserves has been made or upon impairment of a lease. Costs associated with wells in progress and completed wells that have yet to be evaluated are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry wells are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful. All items classified as unproved property are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization. Under full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the “cost ceiling”) equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves, based on current prices and operating conditions, discounted at ten percent (10%), plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to operations. For purposes of the ceiling test calculation, current prices are defined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices are adjusted for basis or location differentials. Unless sales contracts specify otherwise, prices are held constant for the productive life of each well. Similarly, current costs are assumed to remain constant over the entire calculation period. Revenue Recognition Oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by the Company in oil and gas properties and royalty revenues. Sales of oil and gas produced from oil and gas operations are recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and title transfers to the purchaser. Charges for gathering and transportation are included in production expenses. Revenue from royalties is recognized as they are earned when collection is reasonably assured. Royalty revenue is recorded in the same period as the sales that generate the royalty payment. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company records a liability for asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with its oil and gas wells when those assets are placed in service. The corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset and included in the carrying amount of oil and gas properties and is depleted over the useful life of the properties. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value. Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  F-9Table of Contents Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. Level 2 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information. The carrying value of all assets and liabilities approximated their fair values as March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Earnings or Loss Per Share In accordance with ASC Topic 280 – “Earnings Per Share”, the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. For the year ended March 31, 2024, net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:    March 31,    2024   (Shares) Convertible notes payable  20,028,538  Income Tax Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. (See Note 10) Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have evaluated all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that these accounting pronouncements will have any material impact on our financial statements or disclosures upon adoption.  F-10Table of Contents Recently adopted accounting standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.” The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a CCF and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). With the adoption of ASU 2020-06, entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature these debts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures.  In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments in this update expand segment disclosure requirements, including new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment among other disclosure requirements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.The adoption of ASU 2023-07 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures.  NOTE 4 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS The Company has asset retirement obligations for any wells that are permanently removed from service. The primary obligations involve the removal and disposal of surface equipment, plugging and abandoning the wells and site restoration. For the purpose of determining the fair value of ARO incurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company used the following assumptions. Inflation Rate  3%Estimated asset life 20 years Credit adjusted risk free interest rate  18% As at March 31, 2016, the Company determined to fully impair its shut in wells given a lack of production over a period in excess of two years, and the uncertainty in returning the wells to production in the future. As a result, the Company has recorded a long term liability equal to the full value of the ARO. During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company determined that the asset has no expectation of future economic benefit. As a result, the asset retirement obligation liability was derecognized and gain on asset retirement obligations of $83,580 was recorded in the statement of operations. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, a total of $0 and $83,580 was recorded as asset retirement obligations, respectively. NOTE 5 – PROMISSORY NOTE – RELATED PARTY On December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note with a majority shareholder, Rise Fast Limited, for an amount of $240,683.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not Applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our company’s management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management has employed a framework consistent with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), to evaluate internal control over financial reporting described below. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management, including our principal executive officer Mr. Huang Yu who is also our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment, Mr. Huang Yu concluded that, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of the year ended March 31, 2025.  17Table of Contents The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our company’s management considered to be material weaknesses under COSO and SEC rules were: (1) lack of a majority of independent directors on the Company’s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) limited number of staff, not allowing for complete segregation of incompatible duties; and (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company’s management in connection with the preparation of our financial statements as of March 31, 2025. Management believes that the appointment of one or more independent directors, will remedy the lack of a majority of outside directors on our company’s Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of IFRS and SEC disclosure requirements. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result in proper segregation of duties.  Any effort to increase the size of the Board of Directors, appoint independent directors or personnel is conditional upon our company raising additional capital. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report. During the Company’s last fiscal quarter there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on June 10, 2025. As of June 10, 2025, there were 22,996,680 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future.
