This Annual
Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” Forward-looking statements reflect
our current view about future events. When used in this Report, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions,
as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements
contained in this Report relating to our business strategy, our future operating results and liquidity and capital resources outlook.
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future
conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in
circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.
They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying
on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements include, without limitation, our ability to raise capital to fund continuing operations; our ability to protect our intellectual
property rights; the impact of any infringement actions or other litigation brought against us; competition from other providers and products;
our ability to develop and commercialize products and services; changes in government regulation; our ability to complete capital raising
transactions; and other factors (including the risks contained in the section of this Annual Report entitled “Risk Factors”)
relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations. Actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended or planned.
Factors
or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of
them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including
the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.
Except
as otherwise indicated, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “Splash”, “SBG” and
the “Company” refer to Splash Beverage Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Splash is a portfolio company managing
multiple brands across several growth segments within the consumer beverage industry. Splash has built organizational capabilities and
an infrastructure enabling it to incubate and/or acquire brands with the intention of efficiently accelerating them to higher volume and
sales revenue. The management team has proven capabilities in building consumer franchises and marketing and distributing multiple brands
of beverages within the non-alcoholic and alcoholic segments. Manufacturing is typically outsourced to third party co-packers and distillers,
or in select cases for a brand such as Copa DI Vino® wines, performed within our own facility in Oregon.
We believe the distribution landscape
in the beverage industry is changing rapidly as tech-enabled e-commerce business models are thriving. Direct to consumer, office or home
solutions are projected to continue to gain traction in the future. Recognizing this opportunity Splash continues to shape its operating
model to be vertically integrated with our e-commerce platform, Qplash, which purchases local and regional brands for developing a direct
line of sales to boutique retail stores and consumers.
Splash’s wholly owned subsidiary, Splash Beverage Group II, Inc. was originally
incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name TapouT Beverages, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring the rights under a license agreement
with TapouT, LLC (Authentic Brands Group). In Q1 2024 the relationship between TapouT LLC and the Company was terminated.
1
In December 2020, Splash Beverage
Group Inc. purchased the key assets of the Copa DI Vino® single serve wine company. The operations and IP for Copa DI Vino®
are wholly owned by Splash and incorporated in the state of Nevada under the name Copa DI Vino® Wine Group Inc.
In addition, Splash has a joint
venture with SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila and Pulpoloco sangria that comes in a biodegradable can.
The Company’s leadership
understands the importance of infusing beverage brands with strong popular culture and lifestyle elements that drive trial, belief and,
most importantly, repeat purchases.
Our management team led by Robert
Nistico has over 28 years of experience in all levels of the three-tier distribution system used in the beverage industry working with
brands such as Red Bull and companies such as Gallo Winery and Republic National Distributing Company (RNDC Texas). Our President &
CMO, Bill Meissner, has led major beverage brands including Sparkling Ice, Fuze, Sweet Leaf Tea and Jones Soda. Our CFO, William Devereux,
has over 15 years of experience in finance, with an emphasis on investing, fundraising, corporate strategy, and mergers and acquisitions.
Our Senior Vice President of Sales, James Allred, has over 25 years’ experience in the beverage industry, predominately with Anheuser-Busch.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to combine the
traditional approach of manufacturing, distributing, and marketing of beverages, with early-stage brands that have a reasonable level
of pre-existing brand awareness and market presence, or have attributes that we believe to be purely innovative. We believe this allows
us to break through the clutter of numerous brand introductions and dilute risk. We apply this philosophy regardless of whether the brand
is 100% owned or a joint venture.
For acquisition or joint venture
consideration, we prefer to work with brands that already have one or more of the following in place:
●
Some level of preexisting brand awareness.
●
Regional presence that can be expanded.
●
Licensing an existing brand name.
●
Add to an underdeveloped and/or growing category capitalizing on consumer trends.
●
Innovation to an existing attractive category (such as flavored tequila).
●
A near term clear path to profitability.
We believe this platform model
provides us with two paths to success: one, developing our wholly owned core brands and two, the ability to tap into high growth, early-stage
brands ready to scale. This platform allows us to limit risk, and significantly reduce development expenses while simultaneously increasing
efficiencies for all brands in our portfolio.
Our management team has over 80
years of combined experience in the beverage industry, including decades of successful brand introductions by our management team (Gallo,
Red Bull, Bacardi, Diageo, Sparkling Ice, Coca-Cola, FUZE Beverage, NOS Energy, PepsiCo, SoBe Beverages, AB InBev, Muscle Milk, Marley
Beverages), we believe our ability to break through the distribution and retail bottlenecks makes us an attractive joint venture partner
to many new brand owners.
Splash has the ability to fully
own a brand or be flexible to engage in business ventures structured with a revenue split, or an equity position.
The benefit to Splash in these
shared brand ownerships is the ability to avoid the development costs for new products. This model spreads our risk over several brands,
contributes to our economies of scale, improves our relationship with distributors and reduces the overall cost of infrastructure.
2
The Company also believes the distribution
landscape in the beverage category is changing rapidly. Tech-enabled business models are thriving and direct to consumer, office and home
solutions are projected to continue to gain traction as beverage alcohol regulations evolve. A core strategy for us is to optimize the
early success we’re seeing with the Qplash online platform, our consumer-packaged goods retail division and our first entry point
into the growing e-commerce channel.
Products
During fiscal year 2024 we produced, distributed and marketed SALT Naturally Flavored
Tequila (“SALT”), a 100% agave 80 proof line of flavored tequilas, Copa DI Vino® single serve wine by the glass,
and also import Pulpoloco Sangria in 3 flavors.
The following is a description
of these products.
SALT Flavored Tequila
We oversee production, distribute,
and market the following flavors under the brand name SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila:
●
Citrus flavor
●
Berry flavor
●
Chocolate flavor
Vodka, rum, and brown spirits have
experienced significant growth when flavors are introduced, and we expect this growth of flavors to continue, as the tequila category
continues to rapidly expand.
SALT is currently being distributed
by various Anheuser-Busch & Miller-Coors distributorships, and other distributors in multiple U.S. states. Additionally, SALT is for
sale in Mexico. SALT has also launched in Guatemala and Japan and efforts continue to grow the brand’s international presence.
SALT is a business venture between
the Company and SALT USA, LLC. All aspects of manufacturing, logistics, distribution and marketing are our responsibility.

TapouT License Agreement
We have the rights under a License
Agreement with ABG TapouT (the “License Agreement”) to produce, market, sell and distribute TapouT sports beverages in North
America (including US Territories and Military Bases), United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Scandinavia, Peru, Colombia, Chile
and Guatemala. The beverages covered by the License Agreement include sports drinks, energy drinks, energy shots, electrolyte chews, energy
bars, water, protein, and teas.
We pay a 6% royalty of net sales
or a guaranteed minimum annual royalty of $660,000, whichever is greater. The License Agreement will expire on December 31, 2025, with
a renewal option through December 31, 2028 at which time it will be reviewed and renegotiated if necessary.
We have the right to use the TapouT brand to market, advertise and promote
for sale our TapouT beverages and branded products. As part of the alliance, Splash commits to investing 2% of sales in marketing to the
TapouT Performance Brand. TapouT provides marketing collateral for advertising and promotion and has influential relationships with select
celebrities and athletic talent. TapouT agrees to use reasonable efforts to request its retained celebrities and/or athletes be present
at autograph signings, tradeshows and other similar events. In Q1 2024 the relationship between TapouT LLC and the Company
was terminated.
Copa DI Vino® Wine Group, Inc. (CdV)
and Related Financing
On December 24, 2020, the Company
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CdV, pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities
that comprise the CdV business for a total purchase price of $5,980,000, payable in the combination of $2,000,000 in cash, a $2,000,000
convertible promissory note to CdV and a variable number of shares of the Company’s common stock based on an attainment of revenue
hurdles.
4
In conjunction with the acquisition,
the Company also entered into a Revenue Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) by and among the Company,
Robert Nistico, additional guarantor and each of the subsidiary guarantors from time-to-time party thereto (each a “Guarantor”,
and, collectively, the “Guarantors”), and Decathlon Alpha IV, L.P. (the “Lender”). The Loan and Security Agreement
provided for a revenue-based credit facility of $1,578,237 (the “Gross Amount”) with the Lender (the “Credit Facility”).
Copa DI Vino® Wine Group, Inc.
Copa DI Vino® is
the leading producer of premium wine by the glass in the United States. The Copa DI Vino® product line is highly innovative
as a ready to drink wine glass capable of going anywhere without the need for a bottle, corkscrew or glass. The company also has a growing
keg wine business for on-premises restaurants and bars.
Through our acquisition of Copa
DI Vino® Corporation, we are now able to offer nine varietals of wine: Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot, Chardonnay, White
Zinfandel, Moscato, Red Blend, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition to its wine varietals, Copa DI Vino®
also procures Pulpoloco, a sangria which is encased in an eco-friendly fiber based can from Spain. The rights to utilize this packaging
for multiple categories were conveyed to SBG in conjunction with the distribution rights.
E-commerce
“Qplash” is a wholly
owned division of Splash. It is our first entry point into the growing e-commerce channel. The division sells beverages online through
www.qplash.com, and third-party storefronts such as Amazon.com. Inside of the division, there are two primary customer groups:
business to business retailers, which in turn offer the products to their customers, and business to consumer, selling direct to end users.
The business-to-business program allows businesses to control inventory, order with payment terms, and offer the convenience of delivery
directly to each store.
During fiscal year 2024, Qplash
offered over 1,500 listings and has warehouses that ship from both California and Pennsylvania.
5
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths
contribute to the Company’s success and differentiate us from our competitors:
●
An established distribution network through global sales channels;
●
A hybrid distribution model that leverages multiple routes to market, including national chains, independent local markets, regional chains, and specialty food and C-Stores
●
Long-term relationships with retailers and the establishment of chains;
●
Premium customer service;
●
Dynamic and sustainable product offerings of natural quality and freshness with health benefits;
●
A highly experienced management team;
●
Strategically selected, dedicated sales professionals;
●
Qplash, our e-commerce platform, which provides us an integrated distribution platform for our non-alcoholic brands;
●
Ability to execute and distribute across many geographies on behalf of our licensed brand portfolio;
●
Strong brand awareness through partnerships and acquisitions of brands with pre-existing brand awareness, or viewed as truly innovative; and
●
Celebrity and professional athlete endorsement of our brands.
Manufacturing and Co-packing
We are responsible for the manufacturing
of Copa DI Vino® and SALT. The Copa DI Vino® product line is bottled at our manufacturing facility in The
Dalles, Oregon. Pulpoloco is imported from Spain as a finished product.
Although we are responsible for
manufacturing SALT, we do not directly manufacture these products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to third party bottlers and
contract packers and distillers.
SALT products are manufactured
in Mexico, under separate arrangements. Our co-packaging arrangements are terminable upon request and do not obligate us to produce any
minimum quantities of products within specified periods.
We purchase concentrates, flavors,
dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, and other components and ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which
are delivered to our manufacturing operations and various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies
may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or packers add
filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into
our approved containers in accordance with our formulas.
6
Distribution
For our beverage-alcohol products,
we operate within what is referred to as a “Three Tier Distribution System” where manufacturers are not permitted to sell
directly to retailers, but instead contract for local and regional distribution with independent distributors. These distributors typically
have geographic rights to distribute major beverage brands and call on every store in a given area such as major cities or regions. Our
management team has extensive experience working within this channel and believes that we will be successful in building a strong network
of these distributors.
In addition to working with these
independent distributors, we also have distribution arrangements with national retail accounts to distribute some of our products directly
through their warehouse operations. Most notably, SBG executed a distribution agreement with AB-InBev, for distribution with their own
operations, AB ONE. This provides SBG very effective distribution capabilities.
Intellectual Property
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we
were granted a trademark for Copa DI Vino®. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the trademark on March
12, 2024, providing our company exclusive rights to use the trademark in connection with the product categories specified in this Form
10-K.
Employees
We have 21 full-time employees,
including non-officer employees and our executive officers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced
any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Listing on the NYSE American
Our common stock and warrants are
listed on the NYSE American exchange under the ticker symbols “SBEV” and “SBEV WT,” respectively.

2025.
On April 16, 2025, the Company, received
an official notice of noncompliance (the “NYSE American Notice”) from NYSE Regulation stating that the Company is not in compliance
with NYSE American continued listing standards (the “Filing Delinquency Notification”) due to the failure to timely file the
Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Delinquent Report”) by the filing due date of April 15,
2025 (the “Filing Delinquency”).
On June 9, 2025, the Company filed
a Certificate of Designation (the “Certificate of Designation” and, collectively with the Subscription Agreement, the “Issuance
Documents”) classifying and designating the Series A Preferred Shares with the Secretary of State of Nevada, which Certificate of

On June 10, 2025, the Company entered
into a Subscription and Investment Representation Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Robert Nistico, the Company’s

an effort to regain compliance with the shareholder equity requirements of the NYSE American. This debt exchange is one key step in meeting
the NYSE American continued listing requirements. The other key step is filing its tardy Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024
and Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31 2025.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
Risks Related to our Business
Our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph
in their opinion regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities
will have little or no value.
Rose, Snyder & Jacobs LLP,
our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, has included an explanatory paragraph in
their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, indicating
that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve
our liquidity position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.
We have sustained recurring
losses and we have had working capital and stockholders’ equity deficits. These prior losses and expected future losses have
had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, continued operations and our ability to
continue as a going concern may be dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing in the near future and thereafter, and
there are no assurances that such financing will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on
reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If
we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through sales of our products, financing or from other sources or
transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our
shareholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.
9
Management recognizes that it may
be required to obtain additional resources via issuances of indebtedness or equity to successfully execute its business plans. No assurances
can be given that management will be successful in raising additional capital, if needed, or on acceptable terms. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting may cause us to fail to timely and accurately report our financial results or result in
a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements.
A significant deficiency
and material weakness exists over our financial reporting. We continue to implement and evaluate the
effectiveness of additional policies and procedures to address identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of
our internal control over financial reporting, as further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report
(“Controls and Procedures”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified a material weakness
in the Company’s internal controls related to dedicated services billing and revenue recognition, and has taken actions in
2025 to have the material weakness remediated. To note, the significant deficiency and material weakness over our financial
reporting or the discovery of additional significant deficiencies or a material weakness and their possible effect on our results,
could have material and adverse effect on our stock price.
We have experienced recurring losses from operations
and negative cash flows from operating activities and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses in the future.
We have experienced recurring losses
from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to our
ongoing operations and generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The size of our losses will depend, in part, on the rate
of future expenditures, our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy and our ability to generate revenues. We incurred a net loss
of $23.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our accumulated deficit increased to $155.8
million as of December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year’s deficit of $133.3
million.
We may encounter unforeseen expenses,
difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. Our prior losses and
expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If our products do not achieve
sufficient market acceptance and our revenues do not increase significantly, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability
in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease
the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue
our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.
If we are not able to successfully execute on
our future operating plans and objectives, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected, and
we may not be able to continue as a going concern.
It is important that we meet our
sales goals and increase sales going forward as our operating plan already reflects prior significant cost containment measures and may
make it difficult to achieve top-line growth if further significant reductions become necessary. If we do not meet our sales goals, our
available cash and working capital will decrease and our financial condition will be negatively impacted.
In order to be successful, we believe
that we must, among other things:
●
increase the sales volume and gross margins for our products and those that we will acquire;
●
maintain efficiencies in operations;
●
manage our operating expenses to sufficiently support operating activities;
●
maintain fixed costs at or near current levels; and
●
avoid significant increases in variable costs relating to production, marketing and distribution.
We may not be able to meet
these objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have incurred significant operating
expenses in the past and may do so again in the future and, as a result, will need to increase revenues in order to improve our
results of operations. Our ability to increase sales will depend primarily on success in expanding our current markets, improving
our distribution base, entering into Direct-To-Retail (DTR) arrangements with national accounts, and introducing new brands,
products or product extensions to the market. Our ability to successfully enter new distribution areas and obtain national accounts
will, in turn, depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the continued demand
for our brands and products in target markets, the ability to price our products at competitive levels, available positions within
the retailer’s planograms, the ability to establish and maintain relationships with distributors in each geographic area of
distribution and the ability in the future to create, develop and successfully introduce one or more new brands, products, and
product extensions.
10
Our
strategic initiatives including acquisitions and divestitures may not be successful and may divert our management’s attention away
from operations and could create general customer uncertainty.
Our
growth strategy is based in part on growth through strategic initiatives including both acquisitions and divestitures, which poses a number
of risks. We may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, achieving targeted values as part of a disposition,
consummating an acquisition or divestiture on satisfactory terms, integrating any newly acquired or expanded business with our current
operations, or separating a divested business or commingled operation effectively. We may issue additional equity, incur long-term or
short-term indebtedness, spend cash or use a combination of these for all or part of the consideration paid in future acquisitions or
expansion of our operations, which may not be available to us on terms we find advantageous or acceptable, if at all. In addition, subject
to any requirements in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we may have significant discretion in how we employ the
consideration received in a divestiture and our management may not apply such consideration in a way that is ultimately accretive to our
business.
The execution of our strategic
initiatives could entail repositioning or similar actions that in turn require us to record impairments, restructuring and other charges.
Any such charges would reduce our earnings. We cannot guarantee that any future business acquisitions or divestitures will be pursued
or that any acquisitions or divestitures that are pursued will be consummated.
Additionally, any acquisition
or disposition (including the successful integration and separation of operations, products and personnel) may place a significant burden
on our management and other internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention, and any difficulties encountered in such
a process, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, our customers may, in response to the announcement
or consummation of a transaction, delay or defer purchasing decisions. If our customers delay or defer purchasing decisions, our revenues
could materially decline or any anticipated increases in revenue could be lower than expected.
Failure to Successfully Integrate Acquired
Businesses, Its Products and Other Assets into the Company, or If Integrated, Failure to Further the Company’s Business
Strategy, May Result in the Company’s Inability to Realize Any Benefit from Such Acquisition.
The consummation and integration of any acquired
business, product or other assets into the Company may be complex and time-consuming and, if such businesses and assets are not
successfully integrated, the Company may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Furthermore,
these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further the Company’s business strategy
as anticipated, expose the Company to increased competition or other challenges with respect to the Company’s products
or geographic markets, and expose the Company to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, technology
or other asset or arrangement. When the Company acquires cannabis businesses, it may obtain the rights to applications for licenses
as well as licenses; however, the procurement of such applications for licenses and licenses generally will be subject to governmental
and regulatory approval. There are no guarantees that the Company will successfully consummate such acquisitions, and even if the Company
consummates such acquisitions, the procurement of applications for licenses may never result in the grant of a license by any state or
local governmental or regulatory agency and the transfer of any rights to licenses may never be approved by the applicable state and/or
local governmental or regulatory agency.
Demand for our products
may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate, market or distribute our products
effectively, and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our beverage portfolio is comprised
of a number of unique brands with reputations and consumer imagery that have been built over time. Our investments in marketing as well
as our strong commitment to product quality are intended to have a favorable impact on brand image and consumer preferences. If we do
not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer and economic trends, health concerns and product preferences, our
financial results could be adversely affected.
Additionally, failure to introduce
new brands, products or product extensions into the marketplace as current ones mature and to meet the changing preferences of consumers
could prevent us from gaining market share and achieving long-term profitability. Product lifecycles can vary and consumer preferences
and loyalties change over time. Although we try to anticipate these shifts and innovate new products to introduce to our consumers, we
may not succeed. Consumer preferences also are affected by factors other than taste, such as health and nutrition considerations and obesity
concerns, shifting consumer needs, changes in consumer lifestyles, increased consumer information and competitive product and pricing
pressures. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by negative publicity associated with these issues. If we do not adequately
anticipate or adjust to respond to these and other changes in consumer preferences, we may not be able to maintain and grow our brand
image and our sales may be adversely affected.
Volatility in the price or availability of the
inputs we depend on, including raw materials, packaging, energy and labor, could adversely impact our financial results.
The principal raw materials we
use include glass bottles, aluminum cans, PET, fiber-board, labels and cardboard cartons, flavorings and sweeteners. These component and
ingredient costs are subject to fluctuation. If there were to be substantial increases in the prices of our ingredients, raw materials
and packaging materials, to the extent that they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would
increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. If our supply of these raw materials is impaired or if prices increase
significantly, it could affect the affordability of our products and reduce sales.
11
If we are unable to secure sufficient
ingredients or raw materials including glass, sugar, and other key supplies, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.
International trade disputes, including U.S.
trade tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, could adversely impact our business.
International trade disputes, including
threatened or implemented tariffs by the United States and threatened or implemented tariffs by foreign countries in retaliation, could
adversely impact our business. Many of our tenants sell imported goods and tariffs or other trade restrictions could increase costs for
these tenants. To the extent our tenants are unable to pass these costs on to their customers, our tenants could be adversely impacted.
In addition, international trade disputes, including those related to tariffs, could result in inflationary pressures that directly
impact our costs, such as costs for steel, lumber and other materials applicable to our redevelopment projects. Trade disputes could also
adversely impact global supply chains which could further increase costs for us and our tenants or delay delivery of key inventories and
supplies.
Significant political, trade, regulatory developments,
and other circumstances beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Significant political, trade, or
regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which we sell our products, such as those stemming from the change in U.S. federal administration,
are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on us. Similarly, changes in U.S. federal policy that affect the geopolitical
landscape could give rise to circumstances outside our control that could have negative impacts on our business operations. For example,
during the prior Trump administration, increased tariffs were implemented on goods imported into the U.S., particularly from China,
Canada, and Mexico. On February 1, 2025, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were subsequently suspended
for a period of one month, and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Historically, tariffs have led to increased trade and political
tensions, between not only the U.S. and China, but also between the U.S. and other countries in the international community. In response
to tariffs, other countries have implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Political tensions as a result of trade policies could
reduce trade volume, investment, technological exchange, and other economic activities between major international economies, resulting
in a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any changes in political, trade,
regulatory, and economic conditions, including, but not limited to, U.S. and China trade policies, could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations.
Regulatory changes or actions may alter the
nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects, or operations.
As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity
and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments have deemed them illegal,
and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while some jurisdictions, such as the United States, subject the mining,
ownership and exchange of cryptocurrencies to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements.
In January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump
issued an executive order forming a presidential working group to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, and leaders
in both houses of the U.S. Congress have announced a bicameral working group with the objective of passing legislation to provide regulatory
clarity for the industry. Committees in both houses of the U.S. Congress have held hearings to ensure fair access to financial services,
including for companies operating in the digital asset space. Additionally, President Trump and members of the U.S. Congress announced
that they are studying the possibility of creating a national strategic digital asset reserve to include Bitcoin, and at least twelve
states have introduced legislation to create strategic Bitcoin reserves.
While these ongoing regulatory developments appear
to be positive, and we anticipate greater regulatory certainty in the future, given the difficulty of predicting the outcomes of ongoing
and future regulatory actions and legislative developments, it is possible that future developments could have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, or operations.
Our business, operations, financial position and timelines, could be materially adversely affected by the continuing military action in Ukraine and
the war between Israel and Hamas.
As a result of the military action commenced in February
2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas commenced in October 2023, and related economic
sanctions imposed or that may in the future be imposed by certain governments, our financial position and operations may be materially
and adversely affected. As our ability to continue to operate will be dependent on raising debt and equity finance, any adverse impact
to those markets as a result of these conflicts, including due to increased market volatility, decreased availability in third-party financing
and/or a deterioration in the terms on which it is available (if at all), could negatively impact our business, results of operations,
cash flows, financial condition, and/or prospects. The extent of any potential impact is not yet determinable, however.
12
Changes in government regulation or failure
to comply with existing regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and properties are
subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling
and distribution of beverage products. In addition, various governmental agencies have enacted or are considering additional taxes on
soft drinks and other sweetened beverages. Changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect
our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious,
so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success.
Our business is dependent upon
awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our target markets. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by our
independent distributors and retailers of our brands as beverage brands that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth. If
we are not successful in the revitalization and growth of our brand and product offerings, we may not achieve and maintain satisfactory
levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of our brand to maintain or increase acceptance or
market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.
Our brands and brand images are keys to our
business and any inability to maintain a positive brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our success depends on our ability
to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot
predict whether our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products’ branding and on
consumer preferences. In addition, negative public relations and product quality issues, whether real or imagined, could tarnish our reputation
and image of the affected brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Our brand image can also be adversely affected by
unfavorable reports, studies and articles, litigation, or regulatory or other governmental action, whether involving our products or those
of our competitors.
Competition from traditional and large, well-financed
non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverage manufacturers may adversely affect our distribution relationships and may hinder development of our
existing markets, as well as prevent us from expanding our markets.
The beverage industry is highly
competitive. We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail outlets and
for marketing focus by our distributors, all of whom also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with all non-alcoholic
and alcoholic beverages, most of which are marketed by companies with substantially greater financial resources than ours. Some of these
competitors are placing severe pressure on independent distributors not to carry competitive brands such as ours. We also compete with
regional beverage producers and “private label” brands.
Increased competitor consolidations,
market-place competition, particularly among branded beverage products, and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our
earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain
or develop our distribution channels, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. Competition, particularly
from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets,
as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.
13
Legislative or regulatory changes that affect
our products, including new taxes, could reduce demand for products or increase our costs.
Taxes imposed on the sale of certain
of our products by federal, state and local governments in the United States, or other countries in which we operate could cause consumers
to shift away from purchasing our beverages. Several municipalities in the United States have implemented or are considering implementing
taxes on the sale of certain “sugared” beverages, including non-diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters to
help fund various initiatives. These taxes could materially affect our business and financial results.
Our reliance on distributors, retailers and
brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand
our business into other geographic markets.
Our ability to maintain and expand
our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish
and maintain successful relationships with reliable distributors, retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas.
Most of our distributors, retailers and brokers sell and distribute competing products, including non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages,
and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the
distributors, retailers and brokers of this network. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions
within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that
may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected
by competition from other beverage companies, some of which may have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors,
retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products,
including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore,
such third-parties’ financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing
and sales activities.
Our ability to maintain and expand
our distribution network and attract additional distributors, retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors, some of which
are outside our control. Some of these factors include:
●
the level of demand for our brands and products in a particular distribution area;
●
our ability to price our products at levels competitive with those of competing products; and
●
our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors, retailers and brokers.
We may not be able to successfully
manage all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Our inability to achieve success
with regards to any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships in that
particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market, which will likely adversely affect our revenues
and financial results.
It is difficult to predict the timing and amount
of our sales because our distributors are not required to place minimum orders with us.
Our independent distributors and
national accounts are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. In order to reduce their inventory costs,
independent distributors typically order products from us on a “just in time” basis in quantities and at such times based
on the demand for the products in a particular distribution area. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing or quantity of purchases by
any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies
and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally, our larger distributors and national partners may make orders that are larger
than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels, supply of raw materials or other key supplies could negatively
affect us.
14
If we do not adequately manage our inventory
levels, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We need to maintain adequate inventory
levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our ability to correctly estimate
demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly for new products, seasonal promotions
and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials,
we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products, we may
end up with too much inventory, resulting in higher storage costs, increased trade spend and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail
to manage our inventory to meet demand, we could damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose
sales opportunities, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the inventory
of our products held by our distributors and retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would also
unfavorably impact our sales and adversely affect our operating results.
If we fail to maintain relationships with our
independent contract manufacturers, our business could be harmed.
We do not manufacture SALT Tequila, Pulpoloco Sangria but instead outsource
the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). We do not own the plants or the
majority of the equipment required to manufacture and package these brands. Our ability to maintain effective relationships with contract
manufacturers and other third parties for the production and delivery of our beverage products in a particular geographic distribution
area is important to the success of our operations within each distribution area. We may not be able to maintain our relationships with
current contract manufacturers or establish satisfactory relationships with new or replacement contract manufacturers, whether in existing
or new geographic distribution areas. The failure to establish and maintain effective relationships with contract manufacturers for a
distribution area could increase our manufacturing costs and thereby materially reduce gross profits from the sale of our products in
that area. Poor relations with any of our contract manufacturers could adversely affect the amount and timing of product delivered to
our distributors for resale, which would in turn adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In addition, our agreements with
our contract manufacturers are terminable at any time, and any such termination could disrupt our ability to deliver products to our customers.
The volatility of energy and increased regulations
may have an adverse impact on our gross margin.
Over the past few years, volatility
in the global oil markets has resulted in variable fuel prices, which many shipping companies have passed on to their customers by way
of higher base pricing and increased fuel surcharges. If fuel prices increase, we expect to experience higher shipping rates and fuel
surcharges, as well as energy surcharges on our raw materials. It is hard to predict what will happen in the fuel markets in 2025 and
beyond. Due to the price sensitivity of our products, we may not always be able to pass such increases on to our customers.
Disruption within our supply chain, contract
manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability, through our suppliers,
business partners, contract manufacturers, independent distributors and retailers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our
success. Damage or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire
or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, labor strikes or other reasons, could impair the manufacture, distribution and sale of our products.
Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or mitigate the likelihood or potential
impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
15
We rely upon our ongoing relationships with
our key flavor suppliers. If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions
in our business.
We currently purchase our flavor
concentrate from various flavor concentrate suppliers, and continually develop other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products.
Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavor-specific ingredients. Although we have the exclusive rights to
flavor concentrates developed with our current flavor concentrate suppliers, and while we have the rights to the ingredients for our products,
we do not have the list of ingredients for our flavor extracts and concentrates. Consequently, we may be unable to obtain these exact
flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. If we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions
in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel,
our efficiency and operations would be adversely affected; in addition, management turnover causes uncertainties and could harm our business.
Our success depends on our ability
to attract and retain highly qualified employees in such areas as finance, sales, marketing and product development. We compete to hire
new employees, and, in some cases, must train them and develop their skills and competencies. We may not be able to provide our employees
with competitive salaries, and our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees,
higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.
Changes to operations, policies
and procedures, which can often occur with the appointment of new personnel, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability
to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, management transition periods are often difficult
as the new employees gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.
Further, to the extent we experience
additional management turnover, our operations, financial condition and employee morale could be negatively impacted. In addition, competition
for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain
qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
If we fail to protect our trademarks and trade
secrets, we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively.
We rely on a combination of trademark
and trade secrecy laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to
protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further,
enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks,
copyrights, licenses and trade
secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly
our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success, and we actively pursue the
registration of our trademarks in the United States and internationally. However, the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights
may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks, trade secrets or similar proprietary
rights. In addition, other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other
parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary
rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands,
profitably exploit our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.
16
As part of the licensing strategy
of our brands, we enter into licensing agreements under which we grant our licensing partners certain rights to use our trademarks and
other designs. Although our agreements require that the use of our trademarks and designs is subject to our control and approval, any
breach of these provisions, or any other action by any of our licensing partners that is harmful to our brands, goodwill and overall image,
could have a material adverse impact on our business.
If we encounter product recalls or other product
quality issues, our business may suffer.
Product quality issues, real or
imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish our image and could cause consumers to
choose other products. In addition, because of changing government regulations or implementation thereof, or allegations of product contamination,
we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific markets. Product recalls could affect our profitability
and could negatively affect brand image.
Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is
costly.
The production, marketing and sale
of our beverages, including contents, labels, caps and containers, are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial,
state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production batch or “run”
is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, which would adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and
our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while
we closely monitor developments in this area, we cannot anticipate whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business
adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Significant additional labeling or warning requirements
may inhibit sales of affected products.
Various jurisdictions may seek
to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content or perceived adverse health
consequences of certain of our products. These types of requirements, if they become applicable to one or more of our products under current
or future environmental or health laws or regulations, may inhibit sales of such products. In California, a law requires that a specific
warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This
law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. If a component found in one of our
products is added to the list, or if the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become available under this law and
related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed
substance in one of our beverages produced for sale in California, the resulting warning requirements or adverse publicity could affect
our sales.
Litigation or legal could expose us to significant
liabilities and damage our reputation.
We may become party to litigation
claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks, uncertainties and costs, including distraction of management attention
away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes
and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose
the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available
to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from
those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and
agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments
to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all
applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal
proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits.
17
Additionally, there has been public
attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol,
including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. We could be exposed to lawsuits
relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices with respect to our alcoholic products. Adverse developments in lawsuits
concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from
lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to risks inherent in sales of
products in international markets.
Our operations outside of the United
States, contribute to our revenue and profitability, and we believe that developing and emerging markets could present future growth opportunities
for us. However, there can be no assurance that existing or new products that we manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be
successful in any particular foreign market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, and consumer preferences
or otherwise. There are many factors that could adversely affect demand for our products in foreign markets, including our inability to
attract and maintain key distributors in these markets; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets; changes in economic,
political or social conditions, the status and renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement, imposition of new or increased
labeling, product or production requirements, or other legal restrictions; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients
or substances used in our products; inflationary currency, devaluation or fluctuation; increased costs of doing business due to compliance
with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations. If we are unable to effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating
in international markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our costs
and capacity.
Water is a main ingredient in substantially
all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing
process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing
unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing
processes require water, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of physical or financial
access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate
change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water
deteriorates, we may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational damage, which could adversely
affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.
Fluctuations in quantity and quality of grape
supply could adversely affect our business.
A shortage in the supply of quality
grapes may result from a variety of factors that determine the quality and quantity of our grape supply, including weather conditions,
pruning methods, diseases and pests, the ability to buy grapes on long and short-term contracts and the number of vines producing grapes.
Any shortage in grape production could cause a reduction in the amount of wine we are able to produce, which could reduce sales and adversely
impact our results from operations. Factors that reduce the quantity of our grapes may also reduce their quality, which in turn could
reduce the quality or amount of wine we produce. Deterioration in the quality of our wines could harm our brand name, reduce sales and
adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Contamination of our wines could harm our business.
We are subject to certain hazards
and product liability risks, such as potential contamination, through tampering or otherwise, of ingredients or products. Contamination
of any of our wines could force us to destroy wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall, which could significantly
damage our reputation for product quality. We maintain insurance against certain of these kinds of risks, and others, under various insurance
policies. However, the insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory
to us and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.
18
Our business and operations would be adversely
impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure or as a result of a cybersecurity attack.
The proper functioning of our own
information technology (IT) infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. We may not have the
necessary financial resources to update and maintain our IT infrastructure, and any failure or interruption of our IT system could adversely
impact our operations. In addition, our IT is vulnerable to cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs,
physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe
that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related
and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of any such IT failures or disruptions,
we could potentially be subject to downtimes, transactional errors, processing inefficiencies, operational delays, other detrimental impacts
on our operations or ability to provide products to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction
or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial
actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
If we fail to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws,
we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which could negatively affect our
business and operating results.
In the ordinary course of our business,
we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals (“personal data”), primarily employees,
former employees and consumers with whom we interact. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and
regulations relating to personal data. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted
in other jurisdictions at any time. These laws impose operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data, and
many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. These requirements with respect to personal data have subjected and may continue
in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require
costly changes to our business practices and information security systems, policies, procedures and practices. Our security controls over
personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we
implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third-party service providers
and vendors whose technology, systems and services we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Unauthorized
access or improper disclosure of personal data in violation of personal data protection or privacy laws could harm our reputation, cause
loss of consumer confidence, subject us to regulatory enforcement actions (including fines), and result in private litigation against
us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of
which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
If our third-party service providers and business
partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.
In the conduct of our business,
we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers,
distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support
of key portions of our operations. These third-party service providers and business partners are subject to similar risks as we are relating
to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and
market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities
in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. In addition, while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing
our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations
or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.
If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business
partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.
19
Our results of operations may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter for many reasons, including seasonality.
Our sales are seasonal, and we
experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. Companies similar to ours have historically generated a greater
percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year
and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of
results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results
expected for the fiscal year.
Changes in accounting standards and subjective
assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.
The U.S. GAAP and related pronouncements,
implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide variety of matters that are relevant to our business, such as, but
not limited to, stock-based compensation, trade spend and promotions, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective
assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes to these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,
estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported results.
If we are unable to maintain effective disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our stock price and investor confidence could be materially and
adversely affected.
We are required to maintain both
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective. Because of their inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting, however well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the controls will prevent or detect misstatements. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only
the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. The failure of
controls by design deficiencies or absence of adequate controls could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results, which could also negatively impact our stock price and investor confidence.
We are dependent on a distiller in Mexico to
provide us with our finished SALT tequila product. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from them or a loss of their services could
cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, and lose credibility in the marketplace.
We depend on a distiller in Mexico,
a company in Jalisco, for the production, bottling, labeling, capping and packaging of our finished tequila product. We do not have a
written agreement with our distiller in Mexico obligating it to produce our product. The termination of our relationship with our distiller
in Mexico distiller or an adverse change in the terms of its services could have a negative impact on our business. If our distiller in
Mexico increases its prices, we may not have alternative sources of supply at comparable prices and may not be able to raise the prices
of our products to cover all, or even a portion, of the increased costs. In addition, if our distiller in Mexico fails to perform satisfactorily,
fails to handle increased orders, or the loss of the services of our distiller in Mexico, along with delays in shipments of products,
could cause us to fail to meet orders, lose sales, incur additional costs, and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn, this could
cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with our customers and consumers, ultimately leading to a
decline in our business and results of operations.
Regulatory decisions and changes in the legal,
regulatory and tax environment where our tequila is produced and where we operate could limit our business activities or increase our
operating costs and reduce our margins.
Our business is subject to extensive
regulation regarding production, distribution, marketing, advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and in Mexico,
where our tequila is produced. We are required to comply with these regulations and maintain various permits and licenses. We are also
required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute, and sell spirits. We cannot assure
you that these and other governmental regulations, applicable to our industry, will not change or become more stringent. Moreover, because
these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation, we may not be able to predict when, and to what extent, liability may arise.
Additionally, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems,
20
including driving while intoxicated, underage drinking,
alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol, various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions
or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current
or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products, could result in monetary penalties, suspension or even revocation
of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business, as we may
find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins, which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our
sales and profit potential.
In addition, the distribution of
beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the United States and internationally (and, in the United States, at
both the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise
duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales
revenue and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories
of beverage alcohol.
We face substantial competition in the alcoholic
and non-alcoholic beverage industry, and we may not be able to effectively compete.
Consolidation among spirits producers,
distributors, wholesalers, or retailers could create a more challenging competitive landscape for our products. Consolidation at any level
could hinder the distribution and sale of our products as a result of reduced attention and resources allocated to our brands, both during
and after transition periods, because our brands might represent a smaller portion of the new business portfolio. Expansion into new product
categories by other suppliers, or innovation by new entrants into the market, could increase competition in our product categories. Changes
to our route-to-consumer models or partners in important markets could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruption, higher implementation-related
or fixed costs, and could negatively affect other business relationships we might have with that partner. Distribution network disruption
or fluctuations in our product inventory levels with distributors, wholesalers, or retailers could negatively affect our results for a
particular period.
Our competitors may respond to
industry and economic conditions more rapidly or effectively than we do. Our competitors offer products that compete directly with ours
for shelf space, promotional displays, and consumer purchases. Pricing, (including price promotions, discounting, couponing, and free
goods), marketing, new product introductions, entry into our distribution networks, and other competitive behavior by our competitors
could adversely affect our sales margins, and profitability.
Our business operations may be adversely affected
by social, political and economic conditions affecting market risks and the demand for and pricing of our products. These risks include:
●
Unfavorable economic conditions and related low consumer confidence, high unemployment, weak credit or capital markets, sovereign debt defaults, sequestrations, austerity measures, higher interest rates, political instability, higher inflation, deflation, lower returns on pension assets, or lower discount rates for pension obligations;
●
Changes in laws, regulations, or policies - especially those that affect the production, importation, marketing, sale, or consumption of our beverage alcohol products;
●Tax rate changes (including excise, sales, tariffs, duties, corporate, individual income, dividends, capital gains), or changes in
related reserves, changes in tax rules or accounting standards, and the unpredictability and suddenness with which they can occur;
●Dependence upon the continued growth of brand names;
●Changes in consumer preferences, consumption, or purchase patterns - particularly away from tequila, and our ability to anticipate
and react to them; bar, restaurant, travel, or other on-premise declines;
21
●Unfavorable consumer reaction to our products, package changes, product reformulations, or other product innovation;
●Decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products in our markets;
●Production facility or supply chain disruption;
●Imprecision in supply/demand forecasting;
●Higher costs, lower quality, or unavailability of energy, input materials, labor, or finished goods;
●Route-to-consumer changes that affect the timing of our sales, temporarily disrupt the marketing or sale of our products, or result
in higher implementation related or fixed costs;
●Inventory fluctuations in our products by distributors, wholesalers, or retailers; Competitors’ consolidation or other competitive
activities, such as pricing actions (including price reductions, promotions, discounting, couponing, or free goods), marketing, category
expansion, product introductions, or entry or expansion in our geographic markets;
●Insufficient protection of our intellectual property rights;
●Product recalls or other product liability claims; product counterfeiting, tampering, or product quality issues;
●Significant legal disputes and proceedings; government investigations (particularly of industry or company business, trade or marketing
practices;
●Failure or breach of key information technology systems;
●Negative publicity related to our company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance or prospects; and
●Business disruption, decline, or costs related to organizational changes, reductions in workforce, or other cost-cutting measures,
or our failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent.
Uncertainty in the financial markets and other
adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect
our industry, business and results of operations.
Global economic uncertainties,
including foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast
and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable,
or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us.
Our limited operating history makes it difficult
to forecast our future results, making any investment in us highly speculative.
We have a limited operating history,
and our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in predicting our future operating results. We may not accurately
forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends, changing preferences or competitive factors facing us, and, therefore,
we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and
estimates of future revenue. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected
revenue shortfall, which could then force us to curtail or cease our business operations.
22
Risks Related to Our Securities
An investment in our common stock is speculative
and there can be no assurance of any return on any such investment.
An investment in our common stock
is speculative and there is no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment. Investors will be subject to substantial
risks involved in an investment in the Company, including the risk of losing their entire investment.
Future sales of common stock, or the perception
of such future sales, by some of our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.
The market price of our common
stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales
may occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares in the
future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
From time to time, certain of our
stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their common shares by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), subject to certain limitations.
In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information
requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), and current
public information and notice requirements.
Our Board of Directors may issue and fix the terms of shares of our
Preferred Stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our Common Stock or any change
in control of our Company.
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize
the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, with par value $0.001 per share, with such designation
rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without
shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely
affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of such issuances, the preferred stock could
be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Any such
issuance would be subject to terms and conditions of any current offering that may disallow any such issuance.
We have 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
authorized and outstanding with mirrored voting rights.
Series A Preferred Stock
Pursuant to a certificate of designation filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on June 10, 2025 (the “Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock”),
one thousand (1,000) shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(“Series A Preferred Stock”). The Certificate of Designation provides that each Series A Preferred Share will have twenty-five
thousand (25,000) votes and will vote together with the Company’s outstanding common shares, par value $0.001 (the “Common
Shares”), as a single class, only with respect to the proposal related to the increase of authorized shares at the Special Meeting.
The holder of the Series A Preferred Shares has granted an irrevocable proxy to certain officers of the Company to vote the Series A Preferred
Shares in accordance with the terms of the Issuance Documents, in connection with the Special Meeting. Per the terms of the Issuance Documents,
if voted, the Series A Preferred Shares are required to vote on the applicable proposals in the same “mirrored” proportion
aggregate votes cast “FOR” and “AGAINST” on the proposal to increase the authorized shares by the holders of the
Common Shares who properly vote on such proposal (but excluding any abstentions). Mr. Nistico, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
directly beneficially owns such one thousand (1,000) share of Series A Preferred Stock.
The outstanding Series A Preferred Shares are required
to be redeemed in whole, but not in part, upon the earliest of: (i) if such redemption is authorized and directed by the Board in its
sole discretion, automatically and effective on such time and date specified by the Board in its sole discretion, (ii) automatically upon
the approval by the Company’s shareholders of the increase of the authorized shares at any meeting of shareholders or (iii) immediately
prior to the record date for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company Upon such redemption, the holder of the Series A Preferred
Shares will receive aggregate consideration equal to the Purchase Price.
23
The Series A Preferred will vote as described above
to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, which could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders if
additional shares are issued. The increase in authorized shares provides us with greater flexibility to issue additional equity securities
for various corporate purposes, including financings, equity compensation, or other strategic transactions. However, any such issuances
may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition,
the issuance of additional shares may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company, which could discourage
or delay takeover attempts that could benefit stockholders. There can be no assurance as to when or if any additional shares will be issued
or the terms on which such issuances may occur.
We have issued multiple classes of preferred
stock in the Company that will result in dilution to existing stockholders upon their conversion
The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the
our Series A-1 Preferred Stock, our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, and our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will result in immediate
and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. Although holders may not receive shares of common stock exceeding 4.99%
of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately after affecting such conversion, this restriction does not prevent holders from
receiving shares up to the 4.99% limit, selling those shares, and then receiving the rest of the shares it is due, in one or more tranches,
while still staying below the 4.99% limit. If holders choose to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our
common stock. Additionally, the continued sale of shares issuable upon successive conversions will likely create significant downward
pressure on the price of our common stock as holders sells material amounts of our common stock over time and/or in a short period of
time. This could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and in turn result in holders receiving an ever-increasing
number of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of its securities, and adjustments thereof, which in turn will likely lead
to further dilution, reductions in the exercise/conversion price of holders securities and even more downward pressure on our common stock,
which could lead to our common stock becoming devalued or worthless
The market price of our common stock
has been volatile over the year and may continue to be volatile.
The market price and
trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year, and it may continue to be volatile.
Over fiscal year 2024 and the date of this annual report, our common stock has traded as low as $0.96 and as high as $29.20
per share. We cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade in the future, and the price of
our common stock may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and
may be influenced by many factors, including our financial results, developments generally affecting the coffee industry, general economic,
industry and market conditions, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, fluctuations in coffee prices,
investor perceptions of our business, reports by industry analysts, negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers
regarding their own performances, and the impact of other “Risk Factors” discussed in the Annual Report.
Because certain principal stockholders own a
large percentage of our voting stock, other stockholders’ voting power may be limited.
As of December 31, 2024, our ten
(10) largest shareholders own or controlled approximately 57% of our outstanding common stock . If those stockholders act together,
they would have the ability to have a substantial influence on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election
and removal of directors and the approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result,
our other stockholders may have little or no influence over matters submitted for shareholder approval. In addition, the ownership of
such stockholders could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us, and consequently, adversely affect the price of our common stock.
These stockholders may make decisions that are adverse to your interests.
We do not expect to pay dividends and investors
should not buy our Common Stock expecting to receive dividends.
We do not anticipate that we will
declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, you will only realize an economic gain on your investment in our
common stock if the price appreciates. You should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Therefore, our failure
to pay dividends may cause you to not see any return on your investment even if we are successful in our business operations.
24
There can be no assurances that our common stock
will not be subject to potential delisting if we do not continue to maintain the listing requirements of the NYSE American.
Since June 11, 2021, our common
stock has been listed on the NYSE American, under the symbol “SBEV”. The NYSE American has rules for continued listing, including,
without limitation, minimum market capitalization and other requirements. Failure to maintain our listing (i.e., being de-listed from
the NYSE American), would make it more difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate price
quotations on our common stock. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our ability to issue additional securities
for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be materially and adversely
affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.
On October 6, 2023, the NYSE American
notified the Company that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) of the continued listing standards set forth in the NYSE American
Company Guide (the “Company Guide”), requiring a listed company to have stockholders’ equity of (i) at least $2.0 million
if it has reported losses from continuing operations or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. The notice had no immediate
impact on the listing of our common stock, subject to our compliance with the other continued listing requirements. In accordance with
applicable NYSE American procedures, we submitted a plan of compliance (the “Plan”) advising of the definitive action(s) the
Company has taken, is taking, or would take, that would bring us into compliance with the continued listing standards within the 18 months
of receipt of the notice. The NYSE American reviewed and accepted the Plan as a reasonable demonstration of an ability to conform to the
relevant standards in the 18-month period. On December 20, 2023, we received a notification (the “Plan Letter”), with NYSE
American acceptance of the proposed plan and further deficiency notice. In the Plan Letter the NYSE American indicated that in addition
to Section 1003(a)(i), the Company was also not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide, requiring a listed company
to have stockholders’ equity of at least $4.0 million if it has reported losses from continuing operations or net losses in three
of its four most recent fiscal years.
On June 5, 2024, the Company received
notification from the NYSE American indicating that it is not in compliance with the Exchange’s continued listing standards
under Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide, requiring a listed company to have stockholders’ equity of $6 million
or more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years.
On April 7, 2025, Company, NYSE
American publicly announced and provided a notice to the Company that NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist
the Company’s Common Stock and publicly trading Warrants to purchase one share of Common Stock, from NYSE American. NYSE Regulation
has determined that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1009(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide as the
Company was unable to demonstrate that it had regained compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) of the Company Guide by the
end of the maximum 18-month compliance plan period, which expired on April 6, 2025.
On
April 16, 2025, the Company, received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE Regulation stating that the Company is
not in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards due to the failure to timely file the Company’s Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2024 by the filing due date of April 15, 2025.
Our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on the NYSE American during the 18-month period, subject to the Company’s compliance with the other continued
listing standards of the NYSE American and continued periodic review by the NYSE American of the Company’s progress with respect
to its Plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet its goals set forth in the Plan. If we are unable to satisfy
the NYSE American rules and listing standards, or are unable to make progress on our Plan, our securities could be subject to delisting.
If the NYSE American were to delist
our securities from trading, we could face significant consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:
25
●	a limited availability
for market quotations for our securities;
●	reduced liquidity with
respect to our securities;
●	a determination that
our common stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules
and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;
●	limited amount of news
and analyst coverage; and
●	a decreased ability
to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
Our common stock could be further diluted as
the result of the issuance of additional common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options.
Our issuance of additional common
stock, convertible securities, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, result in a reduction in the overall
percentage holdings of our stockholders, could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock, could result in adjustments
to conversion and exercise prices of outstanding notes and warrants, and could obligate us to issue additional common stock to certain
of our stockholders.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
We have established policies and processes for assessing,
identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these processes into our overall risk management
systems and processes. We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence
on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
of our information systems or any information residing therein.
We conduct periodic risk assessments to identify cybersecurity
threats, as well as assessments in the event of a material change in our business practices that may affect information systems that are
vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external
risks, the likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems,
and safeguards in place to manage such risks.
Following these risk assessments, we re-design, implement,
and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly
monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. Primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our cybersecurity risks rests
with the President who reports to our Chief Executive Officer, to manage the risk assessment and mitigation process.
We engage consultants, or other third parties in connection
with our risk assessment processes. These service providers assist us to design and implement our cybersecurity policies and procedures,
as well as to monitor and test our safeguards. We require each third-party service provider to certify that it has the ability to implement
and maintain appropriate security measures, consistent with all applicable laws, to implement and maintain reasonable security measures
in connection with their work with us, and to promptly report any suspected breach of its security measures that may affect our company.
We have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that
have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.
26
Governance
Our board of directors addresses the Company’s
cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The board of directors’ audit committee is responsible
for overseeing Company’s cybersecurity risk management processes, including oversight and mitigation of risks from cybersecurity
threats.
Our cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes
are implemented and maintained by certain Company management, including the information technology team at the direction of our President.
Our executive team including our Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for hiring appropriate personnel,
helping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into the Company’s overall risk management strategy, and communicating key
priorities to relevant personnel. This executive team is responsible for approving budgets, helping prepare for cybersecurity incidents,
approving cybersecurity processes, and reviewing security assessments and other security-related reports.
Our cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability
management policies are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members of management depending on the circumstances,
including our Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Company’s incident response and vulnerability
management policies include reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors for certain cybersecurity incidents including significant
breaches to the Company’s networks or systems. The audit committee receives regular reports from the information technology team
concerning the Company’s significant cybersecurity threats and risk and the processes the Company has implemented to address them.
The audit committee also has access to various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity threats, risk and mitigation.

Business Overview
Canfield Medical Supply, Inc. (“CMS”)
a company’s whose common stock was quoted on the OTCQB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SBG Acquisition Inc. (“Merger
Sub”), a Nevada Corporation wholly-owned by Canfield, and Splash Beverage Group, II Inc.. a Nevada corporation (“Splash”)
pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Splash (the “Merger”) with Splash as the surviving company and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Canfield. The Merger was consummated on March 31, 2020.
28
As the owners and management of Splash had voting
and operating control of CMS following the Merger, the Merger transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition (that is with Splash
as the acquiring entity), followed by a recapitalization.
On July 31, 2020, CMS changed its name to Splash Beverage
Group, Inc. (“SBG”). On June 11, 2021, SBG’s common stock and warrant to purchase common stock began trading on the
NYSE American under the symbols “SBEV” and SBEV WT,” respectively.
On November 8, 2021, SBG reincorporated into the State
of Nevada and became a Nevada corporation.
Our principal offices are located at 1314 E. Las Olas Blvd, Suite 221,
Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301. Our website address is www.splashbeveragegroup.com. We have not incorporated by reference into this Annual

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December
31, 2024, compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023.
Revenue
Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $4.2 million compared to revenues of $18.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Part of the $14.7` million decrease in sales
was mainly due to a decrease in our beverage sales of $1.7 million. Additionally, revenues
from our vertically integrated B2B and B2C e-commerce distribution platform called Qplash
decreased approximately $13 million or 88.5% due to low inventory . Total sales declined
due to limited liquidity to procure inventory to drive third-party sales.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31,
2024 were $3.8 million compared to cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $13.3 million. The $9.5 million decrease
in cost of goods sold was due to our decreased sales. The $8.4 million decrease in cost of goods sold   was driven by decreased
sales in the e-commerce and $1.1 million was driven by beverage business.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
2024 were $16.4 million compared to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily
due to $1.7 million of marketing expense, $0.5 million of contracted services, $2.1 million of other general and administrative expenses
partially offset by increases of the non-cash expenses related to share issuance of $1.2 million. The loss of intangible impairment of
$4.2 million was recorded in the other general and administrative expenses.
Other Income/(Expense)
Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024
were $6.9 million compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The other expense increased of $1.2 million is mainly
driven by an increase in interest expense. Interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.9 million compared to $1.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $1.0 million increase in interest expense is due to new loans with a principal of $3.2
million with higher interest rates. The Company also reserved   $0.3 million for legal settlement. Offset by a decrease in
amortization of debt discount of $0.2 million and $0.03 million in other expenses.
29
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors
in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.
In addition, the Company has an active registration statement on Form S-3 to facilitate raising additional funds.
As of December 31, 2024, we had total cash of $15,346,
as compared with $379,978 at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to expenses relating to operating the business.
Net cash used for continuing operating activities
during the year ended December 31, 2024, was $8.0 million as compared to the net cash used by continuing operating activities for the
year ended December 31, 2023, of $10.2 million. The primary reason for the change in net cash used was due to an increase of $1.2 million
in non-cash share-based compensation, and a decrease of $1.6 million in losses of the business, offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in
working capital.
Net cash used for investing activities during the
year ended December 31, 2024, was $0.01 million as compared to the net cash used for investing activities during the year ended December
31, 2023, of $0.01 million. The net cash used in the year 2024 was for machinery & equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the
year ended December 31, 2024, was $7.5 million compared to $6.1 million provided from financing activities for the year ended December
31, 2023. Company received $9.5 million and $6.6 million proceeds from the issuance of debt in years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. No cash advance from shareholders in 2024, $0.2 million was received from a shareholder advance in the year ending December
31, 2023. Principal repayment of debt of $2.0 million and $1.0 million were made in years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
A cash advance from related party of $0.01 million and $0.4 million was received in 2024 and 2023 respectively.
In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations,
we will need to raise additional equity or debt capital. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed
from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We will be required to pursue sources of additional
capital through various means, including debt or equity financings. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive
to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for new investors.
Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, and
the issuance of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have additional dilutive effects. Further, we may incur
substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing
and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities
we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to obtain needed
financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and our history of losses, which could impact the availability or cost
of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities together with our revenues from operations,
is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to curtail
or cease operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
30
Revenue
The Company faces significant judgment
in revenue recognition due to the complexities of the beverage industry’s competitive landscape and diverse distribution channels.
Determining the timing of revenue recognition involves assessing factors such as control transfer, returns, allowances, trade promotions,
and distributor sell-through data. Historical analysis, market trends assessment, and contractual term evaluations inform revenue recognition
judgments. However, inherent uncertainties persist, underscoring the critical nature of revenue recognition as it significantly impacts
financial statements and performance evaluation.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is established
based on historical experience, current economic conditions, and specific customer collection issues. Management evaluates the collectability
of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and adjusts the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions or customer creditworthiness
could result in adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impacting our reported financial results.
Inventory Valuation
We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Estimating the net realizable value of inventory involves significant judgment, particularly when market conditions change rapidly
or when excess or obsolete inventory exists. Management regularly assesses inventory quantities on hand, future demand forecasts, and
market conditions to determine whether write-downs to inventory are necessary.
Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurements involve significant judgment and estimation, particularly when observable
inputs are limited or not available. Management utilizes valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models, market comparables,
and third-party appraisals to determine fair values.

Report of Independent Registered

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Splash
Beverage Group, Inc. at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’
equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Uncertainty
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered
recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
F-2
Evaluation of Intangible Assets for Impairment
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, intangible
assets are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of the asset may be below its
carrying value. This analysis involves comparing events and circumstances such as general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific
to the industry and company specific factors. These fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions and judgments, such
as projections of operating expenditures, discount rates, and future levels of revenue.
The Company has experienced a decline in its reported amounts of Beverage
revenue and the Beverage operating segment has experienced losses from operations for the past several years. These factors were considered
a triggering event indicative of impairment, which resulted in an impairment assessment by management. Pursuant to current accounting
guidance, management performed a quantitative analysis and concluded that its intangible assets were impaired and the Company recorded
impairment charges of approximately $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s intangible
asset balance was $0.
Auditing management’s annual impairment tests was complex because
of the significant judgment required to evaluate management’s assumptions used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets.
How We Addressed the Matter
in our Audit
Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of intangible assets for
impairment included the following, among others:
1.We
evaluated managements significant accounting policies related to the impairment of intangible
assets for reasonableness.
2.We
evaluated management’s assessment of the grouping of long-lived assets for which separately
identifiable cash flows can be determined.
3.With
respect to the Company’s valuation of its intangible assets:
a.We
assessed the qualifications and competence of management
b.We
evaluated the methodologies used to determine the fair value of the Company’s intangible
assets
c.We
reperformed management’s quantitative analysis to assess the impact of intangible asset
impairment
4.We
assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures regarding impairment assessments
included in Note 2.

Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Business Organization and Nature of Operations
Splash Beverage Group (“SBG” or “Splash”),
formally Canfield Medical Supply, Inc. (“CMS”) was incorporated in the State of Ohio on September 3, 1992, and changed
domicile to Colorado on April 18, 2012. CMS was in the business of home health services, primarily the selling of durable medical equipment
and medical supplies to the public, nursing homes, hospitals and other end users.
On December 31, 2019, CMS entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SBG Acquisition Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Nevada Corporation wholly
owned by CMS, and Splash Beverage Group, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Splash”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and
into Splash (the “Merger”) with Splash as the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMS. The Merger was consummated
on March 31, 2020.
As the owners and management of Splash have voting
and operating control of CMS following the Merger, the Merger transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition (that is with Splash
as the acquiring entity), followed by a recapitalization.
As part of the recapitalization, previously issued
shares of SBG preferred stock have been reflected as shares of common stock that were received in the Merger. These common shares have
been retrospectively presented as outstanding for all periods.
Splash specializes in the manufacturing process, distribution,
and sales & marketing of various beverages across multiple channels. Splash operates in both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverage
segments. Additionally, Splash operates its own vertically integrated B-to-B and B-to-C E-commerce distribution platform called Qplash,
further expanding its distribution abilities and visibility.
In July 2020 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment
of Articles of Incorporation of CMS with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado, pursuant to which the Company changed its name
from CMS. to Splash Beverage Group, Inc. On July 31, 2020, we received approval from FINRA to change the Company’s name from CMS
to Splash Beverage Group, Inc. Our new ticker symbol is SBEV.
On December 24, 2020, SBG consummated an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the “Copa APA”) with Copa DI Vino® Corporation (“CdV”), to purchase certain assets and
assume certain liabilities that comprise the Copa DI Vino® business for a total purchase price of $5,980,000, payable in
the combination of $2,000,000 in cash (“Cash Consideration”), $2,000,000 convertible promissory note (the “Convertible
Note”) to Seller and a variable number of shares of the Company’s common stock based on a attainment of revenue hurdles. CdV
is one of the leading producers of premium wine by the glass in the United States with its primary offices and facilities in The Dalles,
Oregon.
On February 2021, Management initiated a plan to divest its CMS business.
As a result, the assets and operations of CMS have been retrospectively reflected as discontinued operations. On November 12, 2021 the
Company changed its state of Domicile from Colorado to Nevada.
In coordination with up listing to the NYSE on
June 11, 2021 the Company consummated a 1.0 for 3.0 reverse stock split. All common stock shares stated herein have been adjusted to reflect
the split.
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Splash and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Holdings and Splash Mex, and CdV. All intercompany balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.
F-8
Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, continued
Our investment in Salt Tequila USA, LLC is accounted
for at cost, as the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.
Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
period financial statements to conform to the current period classifications. These reclassifications had no impact on net loss.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents and Concentration of Cash
Balance
We consider all highly liquid securities with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
Our cash in uninsured foreign bank accounts was $4,817
and $0 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts
Accounts receivables are carried at their estimated
collectible amounts and are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with clients and other factors. We
establish provisions for losses on accounts receivable on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance,
and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accounts receivable amounts are reflected net of allowances
of $300,827 and $183,089 , respectively.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, accounted for using the weighted average cost method. The inventory balances at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted
of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods held for distribution. The cost elements of inventory consist of purchase of products,
transportation, and warehousing. We establish provisions for excess or inventory near expiration based on management’s estimates
of forecast turnover of inventories on hand and under contract. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for certain products
as compared to forecast amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. Provisions
for excess inventory are included in cost of goods sold and have historically been adequate to provide for losses on inventory. We
manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of inventory on hand and under commitments. The
amount of our reserve was $621,178 and $290,524 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost when purchased.
Depreciation is recorded for property, equipment, and software using the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful lives
of assets, which range from 3-20 years. Company management reviews the recoverability of all long-lived assets, including the related
useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset might not be recoverable.

Excise taxes
The Company pays alcohol excise taxes based on product
sales to both the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
(TTB). The Company also pays taxes to the State of Florida – Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco. The Company is liable
for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The federal tax rate is affected by
a small winery tax credit provision which decreases based upon the number of gallons of wine production in a year rather than the quantity
sold.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial Accounting Standards (“FASB”)
guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 -
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.
Level 2 -
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active).
Level 3 -
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The liabilities and indebtedness presented on the
consolidated financial statements approximate fair values at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consistent with recent negotiations
of notes payable and due to the short duration of maturities.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance sets forth a five-step model which depicts the recognition of revenue in an amount that reflects
what we expect to receive in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers.
F-10
Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, continued
We recognize revenue when our performance obligations
under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control of our products is transferred upon delivery
to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and is
presented net of provisions for customer returns and allowances. The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies
with changes in customer incentives we offer to our customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from
revenue.
Distribution expenses to transport our products, and
warehousing expense after manufacture are accounted for in Other General and Administrative cost.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold include the costs of products,
packaging, transportation, warehousing, and costs associated with valuation allowances for expired, damaged or impaired inventory. The
cost of transportation from production site to other 3rd party warehouses or customer is included in Other General and Administrative
cost.
Other General and Administrative Expenses
Other General and Administrative expenses include Amazon selling fees, cost of
transportation from production site to other 3rd party warehouses or customers, insurance cost, consulting cost, legal and
audit fees, investor relations expenses, travel & entertainment expenses, occupancy cost and other cost.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance
with ASC 718,”Compensation - Stock Compensation”. Under the fair value recognition provisions, cost is measured at
the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally
the option vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. We early adopted
ASU 2018-07, “Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which aligns accounting treatment for such awards
to non-employees with the existing guidance on employee share-based compensation in ASC 718.
We measure stock-based awards at the grant-date fair
value for employees, directors and consultants and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
the award. Determining the appropriate fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair
value of our common stock, and for stock options and warrants, the expected life of the option and warrant, and expected stock price volatility
and exercise price. We used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its stock-based awards. The assumptions used in calculating
the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense
could be materially different for future awards. The expected life of stock options/warrants were estimated using the “simplified
method,” which calculates the expected term as the midpoint between the weighted average time to vesting and the contractual maturity,
we have limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns. The simplified method is based
on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. For stock price volatility, we use comparable public companies
as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of award. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes
with a term approximating the expected life of the award. The estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,
and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from the Company’s current estimates, such amounts are recognized as
an adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised.

Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, continued
Income Taxes
We use the liability method of accounting for income
taxes as set forth in ASC 740,”Income Taxes”. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect
during the years in which the basis differences reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is not more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will be realized.
Company management assesses its income tax positions
and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available
at the reporting date. In accordance with ASC 740-10, for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax
benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
For those income tax positions where there is less
than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements. Company management
has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023  . See note   13.
Net income (loss) per share
The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing
the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common outstanding. Warrants, stock options, and common stock issuable
upon the conversion of the Company’s convertible debt or preferred stock (if any), are not included in the computation if the effect
would be anti-dilutive.
Weighted average number of shares outstanding excludes
anti-dilutive common stock equivalents, including warrants to purchase shares of common stock and warrants granted by our Board that have
not been exercised totaling 3,424,996.
Advertising
We conduct advertising for the promotion of our products.
In accordance with ASC 720-35, advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. We recorded advertising expense of $486,942
and $1,721,547   for the years ended December 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Goodwill and other intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost
over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth
quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting
unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative
analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based
on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics
to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
At the time of acquisition, the Company estimates
the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets based upon the facts and circumstances related to the particular intangible
asset. Inherent in such estimates are judgments and estimates of future revenue, profitability, cash flows and appropriate discount rates
for any present value calculations. The Company preliminarily estimates the value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets and then
finalizes the estimated fair values during the purchase allocation period, which does not extend beyond 12 months from the date of acquisition.
The Company’s amortization expense for acquired identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives was $392,068 for fiscal
years 2024 and 2023.
F-12
Splash Beverage Group, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill
and Other, the Company performed an impairment test for its Brand Name, Customer Relationships and license. Based on this assessment,
the Company determined that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeded its fair value, resulting in an impairment loss of $4.3
million.
The impairment loss of $4.3 million was recorded in the statement of operations
within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. This impairment was primarily driven by the decline in the Company’s
sales and was calculated using the present value of future cash flows.

Long-lived assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment
on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount
of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses
to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated
from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is
not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying
value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value
is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals
from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques.
Foreign Currency Gain/Losses
Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is
the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates.
Gain or losses from these translation adjustments are included in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive (loss)
income as foreign currency translation gains or losses. Translation gains and losses that arise from the translation of net assets from
functional currency to the reporting currency, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances, are included in Other Comprehensive
Income. The Company incurred a foreign currency translation net gain during the year ended December 31, 2024 of $97,763 and a foreign
currency translation net gain during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $3,889.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adoption of FASB ASU 2020-06
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Accounting
for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.” ASU 2020-06
simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts by removing certain models
that were previously required to be applied. The amendments are effective for the fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted
ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2024 and has removed the effects of any embedded conversion
features from certain of our convertible instruments as of that date.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 3 – Liquidity, Capital Resources
and Going Concern Considerations
During 2024, the Company received $9.5 million from
issuance of debt.
The Company’s consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of US GAAP for a going concern, on the premise that the Company is able to meet its
obligations as they come due in the normal course of business. The Company sustained a net loss of approximately $22.9
million and negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $0.37
million for the year ended December 31, 2024. To date the Company has generated cash flows from issuances of equity and
indebtedness.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of July 11, 2025, the Company
has incurred significant losses from operations and has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, the Company’s
current liabilities exceed its current assets, and it has a working capital deficit.
Management’s plans in regard to these matters
include actions to sustain the Company’s operations, such as seeking additional funding to meet its obligations and implement its
business plan. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing its plans or in raising additional funds.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, adjustments would be
necessary to the carrying values of its assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses could be materially affected.

Note 11 – Commitment and Contingencies
The Company is a party to asserted claims and are
subject to regulatory actions in the ordinary course of business. The results of such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
but the Company does not anticipate that the outcome, if any, arising out of any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition or results of operations.
On June 5, 2024, the Company received notification
from the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”) indicating that it is not in compliance with the NYSE American’s continued
listing standards under Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”), requiring a listed
company to have stockholders’ equity of $6 million or more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations
and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. The Company is now subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009
of the Company Guide. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by April 6, 2025 or if the Company does
not make progress consistent with the Plan during the plan period, the NYSE American may commence delisting procedures.
The licensing agreement between TapouT LLC and the Company was terminated
in Q1 2024. The parties are engaged in active and constructive settlement discussions pursuant to the terms of the agreement’s termination
provisions. Based on the settlement discussions, the Company anticipates that any final settlement will not exceed the amounts already
recorded in its legal reserve and accrued accounts payable.
Note 12 – Tax Provision
The Company has evaluated the positive and negative
evidence in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of
deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies to determine which deferred tax assets
are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Due to uncertainty about the Company’s ability to utilize its deferred tax
assets, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s net operating
loss carryforward for Federal income tax purposes was $99,567,157, which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used,
these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2032, except for the net operating losses generated January 1, 2018 and after, which amounted
to $76,541,071, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
There was no income tax expense or benefit for the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to the full valuation allowance recorded.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
On
March 27, 2025, the Company implemented a 1.0 for 40.0 reverse stock split. All common stock shares, warrants, and conversion prices
stated herein have been adjusted to reflect the split. The purpose of this reverse split was to maintain the Company’s listing
on the NYSE American.
In April 2025, the Company
issued a 5-year promissory note in the amount of 200,000, it accrues interest at 15%, and is convertible into shares of common stock
at $1.25. The note also received 125,000 5-year warrants exercisable at $2.00, and 83,334 5-year warrants exercisable at $3.00.
In
May 2025, the Company issued 650 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock in exchange for approximately $650,000. Series A-1 shares are convertible
into common stock, subject to shareholder approval, and further discussed in Note 6. Investors of A-1 Shares also received 162,500 1-year

Costa Rica. The Company issued 20,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock as consideration, at an initial stated value of $1000 per share.
Management determined that the transaction is an asset acquisition under ASC 805, as substantially all of the fair value is concentrated
in a single identifiable asset—the water rights—and no substantive processes were acquired. The preliminary fair value of
the acquired assets has been estimated at approximately $20 million and is subject to revision. The Series C shares are convertible into
common stock, subject to shareholder approval, and further discussed in Note 6

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
(1) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have adopted and maintain
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods required under the SEC’s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial
Officer), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that due to our limited resources our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective in providing material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings on a timely basis
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure about our internal
control over financial reporting discussed below Following the 2022 evaluation by management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures we implemented new controls and process in 2023.
(2) Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Our internal control system was designed
to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to our management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on that assessment,
our management has determined that as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to material
weaknesses related to a limited segregation of duties due to our limited resources and the small number of employees, resulting in a lack
of controls to ensure   maintenance of documentation
supporting transactions recorded in the Company’s accounting records. Management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes
a material weakness which could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that could result in a material
misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing,
we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting.
This Annual Report does not
include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding management’s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC.
(3) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over
financial reporting other than items highlighted above, identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information.
None.
ITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS.
Not applicable.

Family Relationships
There are no family relationships

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Com
Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act requires that our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock (referred
to herein as the “reporting persons”) file with the SEC various reports as to their ownership of and activities relating to
our common stock. Such reporting persons are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they
file. Based solely on our review of copies of the reports filed with the SEC and the written representations of our directors and executive
officers, we believe that all reporting requirements for fiscal year 2024 were complied with by each person who at any time during the
2024 fiscal year was a director or an executive officer or held more than 10% of our common stock, except for the following: Julius Ivancsits,
and Stacy McLaughlin each filed a late Form 3 report at the time of their appointments and on becoming insiders of the Company. Julius
Ivancsits filed a late Form 4 report on May 6, 2024.
Committees of the Board
of Directors
Audit Committee
We have separately designated
an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, the appointment, compensation, removal and oversight of
the work of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, overseeing the accounting and financial reporting process
of the Company, and reviewing related person transactions. During fiscal year 2024 our Audit Committee is comprised of John Paglia and
Bill Caple. Under NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, all the directors on the audit committee must be independent. Also,
as a smaller reporting company, we are only required to maintain an audit committee of two independent directors. Our Board has determined
that John Paglia and Bill Caple are independent under NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules. John Paglia is the Chairperson
of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our Board has determined that John Paglia qualifies
as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee operates under a written
charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which can be found on our website at www.splashbeveragegroup.com. During 2024, the Audit Committee
held four meetings in person or through conference calls. The Company has replaced Dr. Paglia on the Audit Committee with Thomas Fore.
Compensation and Management Resources Committee
We have established a Compensation
and Management Resources Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of the Compensation and Management Resources Committee is to
assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to executive compensation, succession planning for the Company’s executive
team, and to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding employee benefit policies and programs, incentive compensation plans
and equity-based plans.
During fiscal year 2024 the members
of our Compensation and Management Resources Committee were Bill Caple and John Paglia. Bill Caple is the chairperson of the Compensation
and Management Resources Committee. As of March 7, 2025, Dr. Paglia is no longer be a member of the Compensation and Management Resources
Committee. The Company has replaced Dr. Paglia on the Compensation Committee with Thomas Fore.
Under NYSE listing standards, we
are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent directors. Our board of directors
has determined that each of John Paglia and Bill Caple is independent under NYSE listing standards. The Compensation and Management Resources

Board leadership structure
and role in risk oversight
The Board of Directors oversees
our business and affairs and monitors the performance of management. In accordance with corporate governance principles, the Board of
Directors does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors keep themselves informed through discussions with the Chief
Executive Officer and other key executives, visits to the Company’s facilities, by reading the reports and other materials that
we send them and by participating in Board and committee meetings. Each director’s term will continue until the election and qualification
of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. The information set forth in Item 1C is incorporated herein
by reference.
Code of Ethics
We have
adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers (including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and any person performing similar functions) and employees. Our Code of Ethics is available at our website at www.splashbeveragegroup.com.
Clawback Policy
On September 20, 2023, the Board adopted the Splash
Beverage Group Clawback Policy (the “Clawback Policy”), effective September 20, 2023, providing for the recovery of certain
incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers of the Company in the event the Company is required to restate
any of its financial statements filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act in order to correct an error that is material to the previously-issued
financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected
in the current period. Adoption of the Clawback Policy was mandated by new Nasdaq listing standards introduced pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 10D-1. The Clawback Policy is in addition to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which permits the SEC to order the disgorgement
of bonuses and incentive-based compensation earned by a registrant issuer’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer
in the year following the filing of any financial statement that the issuer is required to restate because of misconduct, and the reimbursement
of those funds to the issuer. A copy of the Clawback Policy has been filed herewith, and can also be found at www.splashbeveragegroup.com.
Insider Trading Policy
The Company has adopted an insider trading policy
that governs the purchase, sale, and/or other transactions of our securities by our directors, officers and employees. A copy of our

with regard to the Company’s trading in its own securities, it is the Company’s policy to comply with the federal securities
laws and the applicable exchange listing requirements.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters.
The following table sets forth
certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of July 9, 2025, for:
●
each of our current directors and executive officers;
●
all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; and
●
each person, or group of affiliated persons, who beneficially owned more than 5% of our common stock.
Except as indicated by the footnotes
below, we believe, based on information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and sole
investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially, subject to applicable community property laws. Unless
otherwise specified, the address for each of the persons named in the table is 1314 E Las Olas Blvd. Suite 221, Fort Lauderdale, Florida
33301.
Our calculation of the percentage
of beneficial ownership is based on 1,547,776 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2025. We have determined beneficial ownership
in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose.
Under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), a beneficial owner of a security includes any
person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting
power, which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose
or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons
share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if
the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information
is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person or persons, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the
amount of shares beneficially owned by such person or persons (and only such person or persons) by reason of these acquisition rights.
