We plan constantly expand the functionality in
our services to make our application more attractive for our consumers. We have purchased the mobile application with LABRIS LIMITED for
iOS and Android platforms and the website for total consideration of US $47,000.
The Company’s revenues are expected to be
derived mostly from advertising and partnerships, but there are also several revenue opportunities that we intend to use in the future,
such as premium account subscriptions, paid packages for the contractors, affiliate programs, analytics and data, additional paid services,
such as transaction security consultations, insurance, and other services that improve the user experience. For a more detailed description

OUR ASSET MOBILE APPLICATION AND WEBSITE
We have a mobile application for Android and IOS
platforms known as “SafeDeal Connect”. The address in Play Market is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sdc.connect
and in App Store – https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safe-deal-connect/id6477819843. Our app is ready to use, but we also intend to
add more features to make the app better and offer wider range of services.
The backend infrastructure of our application
is built on the Node.js software platform, employing the Express.js framework to streamline communication with the client via HTTP requests.
For the backend, MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is integrated to enhance flexibility and scalability in handling dynamic data. MongoDB’s
document-oriented approach proves invaluable, allowing seamless adaptation to evolving data structures. On the front end, the user interface
is constructed using the React JavaScript library, known for its declarative and efficient approach to building interactive UIs. React’s
component-based architecture facilitates modular and maintainable code, contributing to a smooth and responsive user experience.

MARKET OVERVIEW
According to the recent reaches of Forbes, by
2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to take place online and the e-commerce market is expected to total over $7.9 trillion. Various
marketplaces make it possible not only to shop online but also to order various services, from painting to software development, without
even leaving home. To quote the above-mentioned Forbes article: “If you’re looking for a way to boost your sales and take
your business to new heights, e-commerce should be on your radar.” Therefore, it goes without saying that e-commerce is at the peak
of popularity and continues to grow rapidly.
Spain is no exception. According to Statistic,
a global data and business intelligence platform, retail e-commerce sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2024 to 2028 in Spain
is 8.22% annually. In addition, there are other factors that demonstrate the relevance of online marketplaces in our days:
-
Gig economy activities are gaining popularity among independent professionals and entrepreneurs, making such platforms relevant to this rapidly growing audience.
-
The general trend towards a mobile lifestyle in Spanish society is driving the popularity of mobile apps for various daily tasks, including searching and providing services.
-
Considering local cultural aspects and peculiarities of the Spanish market allows creating a product that more closely matches the expectations and needs of users.
-
Such platforms can act as a catalyst for the development and support of small businesses and freelancers, adding social and economic value.
As the digital economy evolves, “SafeDeal
Connect” remains dedicated to connecting, empowering, and providing a dynamic platform for individuals and businesses to thrive
in the Spanish e-commerce ecosystem.

COMPETITION
There are numerous global companies in the industry.
Among them: Craigslist, Gumtree, OLX, Mercari and others. They provide their services in English and other different languages, as usual,
but all these companies operate in Spain, or at least in some parts of it, but they are focused on the global market rather than on a
specific country, so we believe that we can start by carving out a niche in the Spanish market. Most of these companies are privately
held; therefore, our future competitors will be substantially larger than our Company and have greater financial and technical resources,
industry expertise, and managerial capabilities than we have. Most of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness with current
and prospective customers.
We believe that industry competition for customers
is primarily based on brand recognition, marketing, price, and quality of service. We hope to be able to compete effectively based on
these factors though we primarily hope to develop a niche market firstly in Spain then we plan to operate over the European countries.
MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY
A significant portion of our earnings will be
allocated to enhancing our mobile application’s improvement and expanding its functionality. This investment aims to attract a broader
audience and enhance the appeal of our services. Additionally, a substantial share of our revenue will be dedicated to advertising and
marketing efforts to promote our services effectively.
Firstly,
our officers and directors, Blas Mayor Reyes and Isabel Marin Vargas will promote our products mouth-to-mouth and present our platform
“SafeDeal Connect” as full working convenient online marketplace. Eventually,
we intend to employ the freelance marketing manager, who will be response for the online advertising and sales.
We plan for our app to be marketed in such ways:
-
Unique Selling Proposition (we clearly define our advantages apart from competitors and will use them to promote our product).
-
Brand Identity (developing a strong and consistent brand identity across all channels).
-
Search Engine Optimization (optimizing content for search engines to improve visibility).
-
Social Media Presence (utilizing platforms relevant to our audience for engagement and promotions).
-
Blog Articles and Guides (sharing valuable content related to our marketplace to attract and educate users).
-
Video Content (creating engaging videos showcasing the benefits of our app and its features).
-
User-generated Content (encouraging users to share their experiences on social media and within the app).
-
Identify Influencers (collaborating with influencers in our industry to extend our reach).
-
Strategic Alliances (forming partnerships with complementary businesses to cross-promote).
-
Continuous Evaluation (regularly assessing and adapting strategies based on market trends and user feedback).
-
Leverage Positive Feedback (showcasing positive user reviews and testimonials to build trust).
-
Localized Marketing (tailoring campaigns for specific regions or cultures).
-

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION
We must adhere to all relevant laws and regulations
that pertain directly or indirectly to our operations, including United States securities laws. Compliance with all regulations, rules,

not significantly affect our business operations.
EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS UNDER THE JOBS
ACT
Mercalot Inc. qualifies as an “emerging
growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”).
The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuers
known as “emerging growth companies.” Emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than $1,07 billion
(as indexed for inflation) during their most recently completed fiscal year. The JOBS Act is intended to facilitate public offerings by
emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and its regulations. An emerging growth
company will retain that status until the earliest of:
·
The first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed $1,07 billion;
·
The first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its IPO;
·
The date on which the company has issued more than $1,07 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period; and
·
The first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least $700 million.
9
Financial and Audit Requirements
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies
are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements. Pursuant to these scaled requirements, emerging growth companies may:
·
Provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their IPO Registration Statement;
·
Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required;
·
Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and
·
Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditor’s attestation regarding the issuer’s internal controls.
Offering Requirements
In addition, during the IPO offering process,
emerging growth companies are exempt from:
·
Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO;
·
Certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the IPO registration statement; and
Other Public Company Requirements
Emerging growth companies are also exempt from
other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:
·
The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation;
·
Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and
·
The requirements under Sections 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.
10
Election under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act
As an emerging growth company, we have made the
irrevocable election to not adopt the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
107(b), as added by Section 102(b), of the JOBS Act.  This election allows companies to delay the adoption of new or revised
accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
Item
1C. Cybersecurity.
Mercalot
Inc. has implemented basic but targeted cybersecurity risk management measures appropriate
for its early-stage operations and limited digital footprint. As a digital marketplace operating
in a primarily cloud-based environment, the Company’s exposure to cybersecurity threats
is continuously monitored by executive management.
The Company currently relies on third-party hosting
and software providers for its core platform operations, email communications, and data storage. These vendors maintain their own cybersecurity
programs, which include network protection, access controls, and incident response procedures. While Mercalot Inc. does not yet employ
a dedicated IT security team, its directors are actively involved in overseeing operational and technological risk, including cybersecurity.
Executive management, consisting of the Chief
Executive Officer and the Board, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, and responding to potential cyber risks. The Company periodically
reviews its internal systems and third-party vendor protocols to assess vulnerabilities and ensure secure handling of sensitive business
information.
To date, Mercalot Inc. has not experienced any
material cybersecurity incidents, and no specific threat has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s
business strategy, operations, or financial condition. However, the Company recognizes that its reliance on cloud infrastructure and
digital communication tools poses an ongoing cybersecurity risk and will continue to assess and strengthen controls as operations scale.
Management plans to formalize its
cybersecurity policies and implement internal training protocols as the business grows.
In 2024, we
did
not identify
any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results
of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide
assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents.
Item 2. Description of Property
We do not own any real estate or other properties.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We know of no legal proceedings to which we are
a party or to which any of our property is the subject which are pending, threatened or contemplated or any unsatisfied judgments against
us.

PART II
Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
Market Information
There is a limited public market for our common
shares. Our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board currently. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s
operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock.
OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or
traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are
conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller

14
Management believes that current trends toward
lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and
in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being
a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure
it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional
corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede
the speed of its operations.
Limited operating history; need for additional
capital
There is no historical
financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have
generated limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is
subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns
due to price and cost increases in services and products.
Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements
The Company does not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Owners and
Board of Directors of Mercalot, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Mercalot, Inc. (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’
deficit, and cash flows from inception date of April 24, 2024 to June 30, 2025 and the year ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows from inception date of
April 24, 2024 to June 30, 2025 and the year ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Substantial Doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, Going Concern, to the financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $38,296 as of June 30, 2025, and net loss of $36,265. These factors raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any
of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Mercalot Inc.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2025
Note 1 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Mercalot Inc. (“the Company”) was
incorporated on April 24, 2024 under the laws of the state of Wyoming. We are a development stage company that is providing an informational
online commerce and classifieds platform, which are also known as online marketplace. We have purchased a mobile application known as
“SafeDeal Connect”, which is already working and in use. Also, we have the website, which is a representation of our application
and introduces its functions to users. Our executive and business office is located at C/ de l'Illa Formentera, 54, Quatre Carreres, 46026
Valencia, Spain, and our telephone number is +13072630861.
Note 2 – GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company had $3,900 revenues for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0 from April 24,
2024 (Inception) through June 30, 2024 . The Company had an accumulated deficit of $38,296 as of June 30,2025, and a net loss of
$36,265 for the year ended June 30, 2025. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates
that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends
to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts,
there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue
as a going concern.
Note 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company’s year-end is June 30.
Development Stage Company
The Company is a development stage company as
defined in ASC 915 “Development Stage Entities”. The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing
the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced. All losses accumulated since Inception has been considered as part
of the Company's development stage activities.
The Company has elected to adopt application of
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.
Upon adoption, the Company no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of
Topic 915.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-6
Due to the limited level of operations, the Company
has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and
liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be
realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures" establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
These tiers include:
Level 1:
defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2:
defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3:
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The carrying value of cash and the Company’s
loan from shareholder approximates their fair value due to their short-term maturity.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair
value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.
Basic Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes income (loss) per share in
accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On November
27, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) — Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The biggest change
in the ASU is the requirement for a public entity to disclose its significant segment expense categories and amounts for each
reportable segment.
F-7
ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU address investor requests
for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to an entity's effective
tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.
We have reviewed all other the recently issued,
but not yet effective and thus not disclosed here, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of those pronouncements will have
a material impact on the Company’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company has accumulated approximately $36,265
of net operating losses (“NOL”) carried forward to offset future taxable income up to 20 years, if any, in future years which
begin to expire in year 2040. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for
every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

In accordance with ASC 855, “Subsequent
Events”, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to June 30, 2025 to the date these financial statements were issued

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A(T) Controls and Procedures
Management’s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 using the criteria established
in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
("COSO").
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
1.We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee,
it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control
over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not
include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
2.We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of June 30, 2025, the Company has not maintained
sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting
functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were
mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.
3.We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at June 30, 2025, the Company
retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the
Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.
Accordingly, the Company concluded that these
control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.
As a result of the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025
based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
System of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
16
An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of June 30, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There was no change in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information.
During
the quarter ended June 30, 2025, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1
trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of
Regulation S-K.
Insider Trading Policies and Procedures
As of June 30, 2025, we do not maintain a formal
insider trading policy or procedures governing the purchase, sale, or other disposition of our securities by directors, officers, or
employees. This is due to our early-stage operations, limited resources, and the lack of equity awards granted to management or staff
during the reporting period. We intend to adopt a formal insider trading policy in the future as our corporate governance structures
evolve.
