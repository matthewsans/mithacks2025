Forward-Looking
Statements
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business
plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking
statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,”
“may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,”
and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties
which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
future prospects on a consolidated basis include but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes,
availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should
also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

1A. Risk Factors
The
report of our independent auditors indicates uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern and this may impair our
ability to raise capital to fund our business. In its opinion on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024,
our independent auditors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that this will
not impair our ability to raise capital on attractive terms. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve significant
revenues and therefore remain a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.
We
have incurred losses in prior periods, and losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our common stock to decline or have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flows. We
have incurred losses in prior periods. Any losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our common stock to decline or have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flows.
There
is doubt about our ability to continue as a viable business. We have not earned a profit from our operations during recent financial
periods. There is no assurance that we will ever earn a profit from our operations in future financial periods.

We
may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to implement our full plan of business. Currently, we do not have sufficient financial
resources with which to establish our new business strategies. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sources of financing,
including in this offering, in order to satisfy our working capital needs.

1C. Cybersecurity
We
believe that information security is a critical component of our business strategy. Therefore, we maintain and continuously assess and
strengthen our cyber security program. We do not maintain a database of information other than for our products
Management
is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Company’s risk exposures and has adopted a risk management framework including
identification, analysis and response to risks affecting our business.
We
have not engaged any third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, which can include penetration testing, independent
audits, or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and effectiveness
of security controls.
We
rely on third-party service providers for a variety of services to run our sales and payment processing. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated
when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers. A cyber-attack at a third-party service provider
could have a significant impact on our business, and we continuously monitor the risks associated with our service providers.
We
believe that currently we have not encountered a cybersecurity event that has had a material impact on our business.

Currently,
we do not own any real estate. Our principal executive offices are located at One Marine Plaza, Suite 305A, North Bergen, New Jersey
04047. We pay rent of $5,400 per month at this location. We believe that our properties are adequate for our current needs, but growth
potential may require larger facilities due to anticipated addition of personnel. We do not have any policies regarding investments in
real estate, securities or other forms of property.

assurance that a regular trading market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable
to resell his securities in our company.

The
ability of individual stockholders to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that
state. A number of states require that an issuer’s securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration
before the securities are permitted to trade in that state. Presently, we have no plans to register our securities in any particular
state. Further, our shares may be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to
as the “penny stock” rule. Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and Rule 15g-9(d)(1)
incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act.
Holders
of Our Common Stock
As
of May 30, 2025, we had 195,248,774 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 706 shareholders of record
at our transfer agent, with approximately 47 additional shareholders holding our shares in street name.
Dividends
We
currently intend to retain future earnings for the operation of our business. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common
stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
In
the event that a dividend is declared, common stockholders on the record date are entitled to share ratably in any dividends that may
be declared from time to time on the common stock by our board of directors from funds legally available.
There
are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes,
however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:
1.
We
would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or
2.
Our
total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities, plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders
who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.
Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans
On
March 19, 2019, our Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to
attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility with us, to provide additional incentive
to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote our success. Under the Plan, we are currently able to issue up to an aggregate
total of 10,000,000 incentive or non-qualified options to purchase our common stock, stock awards and other offerings.

7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Results
of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Revenues.
We reported $1,349,905 (unaudited) and $16,468 (unaudited) in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (“Interim 2024”)
and 2023 (“Interim 2023”), respectively. All of our revenues for Interim 2024 were attributable to the business operations
of EMGE for the period from the acquisition date, March 14, 2024. All revenues reported for Interim 2023 were attributable to the Subsidiary.
Gross
Profit. For Interim 2024, our cost of revenue was $477,079 (unaudited), compared to cost of revenue of $13,257 (unaudited) for
Interim 2023, resulting in a gross profit of $872,826 (unaudited) for Interim 2024 and a gross profit of $3,211 (unaudited) for Interim
2023.
All
cost of revenue and gross profit for Interim 2024 were attributable to the business operations of EMGE for the period from the acquisition
date, March 14, 2024. All cost of revenue and gross profit reported for Interim 2023 were attributable to the Subsidiary.
6
Operating
Expenses. Our operating expenses were $2,219,787 (unaudited) and $195,627 (unaudited) for Interim 2024 and Interim 2023, respectively.
Our operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 can be expected to increase as the effects of the acquisition of EMGE impact on our
operating results. No prediction as to the level of operating expenses for all of 2024 can be made in this regard, however.
Other
Income/Expense. We had other expense of $208,805 (unaudited) for Interim 2024, compared to $819,016 (unaudited) in other expense
for Interim 2023.
Net
Income/Loss. For Interim 2024, we had a net loss of $1,555,767 (unaudited), compared to a net loss of $1,011,432 (unaudited)
for Interim 2023.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
In
connection with the EMGE transaction, we obtained a loan from a third party and, subsequent to the closing of the EMGE transaction, we
have obtained an additional loan from another third party. We remain, nevertheless, dependent on additional investment capital to
continue our survival. Historically, we have raised money through convertible debt, almost always on unfavorable terms. There is no guarantee
that any capital, including through convertible loan transactions, will be available to us in the future or, if available, on terms acceptable
to us. The terms of the recently obtained loans are discussed below.
AJB
Capital Investments, LLC. In March 2024, the Company obtained a loan from AJB Capital Investments, LLC (AJB) which netted the
Company $252,000 in proceeds. In consideration of such loan, the Company issued a $280,000 face amount promissory note (the AJB Note),
with OID of $28,000, bearing interest at 12% per annum, with principal and interest payable on September 4, 2024. The Company has the
right to repay the AJB Note at any time. Should the Company be in default, which shall not have been cured, the AJB Note is convertible
into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price that shall equal the volume weighted average trading price (a)
during the previous 20 trading-day period ending on the date of issuance of the AJB Note or (b) during the previous 20 trading-day period
ending on the relevant conversion date, whichever is lower.
The
AJB Note is secured by all assets of our company.
In
addition, we issued to AJB a pre-funded common stock purchase warrant (the AJB Warrant) to purchase 3,428,571 shares of our common stock,
with a nominal exercise price of $.00001 per share. The AJB Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis,
Ray
Vollintine. In March 2024, the Company obtained a loan from Ray Vollintine (Vollintine) which netted the Company $250,000 in
proceeds. In consideration of such loan, the Company issued a $280,000 face amount promissory note (the Vollintine Note), with OID of
$30,000, bearing interest at 12% per annum, with principal and interest payable on September 29, 2024. The Company has the right to repay
the Vollintine Note at any time. The Vollintine Note is convertible at any time and from time to time into shares of the Company’s
common stock at a conversion price that shall equal to $.035; provided, however, that, upon an event of default, the conversion price
shall be the lower of (a) $.035 or (b) the volume weighted average trading price during the previous 20 trading-day period ending on
the date of issuance of the Vollintine Note or during the previous 20 trading-day period ending on the relevant conversion date, whichever
is lower.
The
Vollintine Note is unsecured.
In
addition, we issued to Vollintine a pre-funded common stock purchase warrant (the Vollintine Warrant) to purchase 7,200,000 shares of
our common stock, with a nominal exercise price of $.00001 per share. The Vollintine Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis, As
further consideration for Vollintine’s purchasing the Vollintine Note, we entered into a make-whole agreement that assures that
Vollintine shall derive not less than $250,000 in net proceeds from Vollintine’s sales of the common stock underlying the Vollintine
Warrant.
As
of December 31, 2024, we had total current assets of $1,044,236 (unaudited), consisting of $68,236 (unaudited) in cash, $6,000 loan receivable
and $970,000 (unaudited) in advances to former acquisition partner-company. Our total current liabilities as of December 31, 2024, were
$4,557,634 (unaudited). Our working capital deficit was $3,513,398 (unaudited) as of December 31, 2024, compared to our working capital
deficit of $2,150,975 (unaudited) as of December 31, 2023.
7
Going
Concern
As
of December 31, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of $28,292,170 (unaudited). Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While
we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will
be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.
Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical
Accounting Policies
In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion
and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a
company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes
to our critical accounting policies as described in the footnotes to our financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2022; however, we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to determining the amount
of revenue to be billed, the timing of revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, capitalization and related amortization of intangible
assets, impairment of assets, and the fair value of liabilities.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
No
new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements.

9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, December 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
and Accounting Officer.
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
and Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based
upon that evaluation, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, we have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financing Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.
We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel
to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional
financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts
may be adversely affected in a material manner.
This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption
for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was enacted
in 2010.

world and the 91st fastest growing franchise of the new millennium (as rated by Entrepreneur Magazine in the 2007 Franchise 500 edition).
It was at this time that Mr. Liberti suffered his own run-in with “bone-on-bone” contact osteoarthritis, the result of a
high school football injury and failed prior reconstructive knee surgery. One of his Chiropractic clients introduced him to his father,
a D.O. performing Hyalgan injections that saved his knee and eliminated the need for further surgical intervention. Amazed by the miraculous
results and lack of awareness in the medical community that this treatment option even existed, Mr. Liberti partnered with this physician
to open the first stand-alone Osteoarthritis specialty practice in southern NJ in 2009. In this facility Mr. Liberti co-developed the

Audit
Committee
We
do not have a separately designated standing audit committee. The entire board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee,
but no written charter governs the actions of the board of directors when performing the functions of that would generally be performed
by an audit committee. The board of directors approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the
independent accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the board of directors reviews the scope and results
of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results,
considers the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be
paid to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor.
We
do not have an audit committee financial expert because of the size of our company and our board of directors at this time. We believe
that we do not require an audit committee financial expert at this time because we retain outside consultants who possess these attributes
as needed.
For
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the board of directors:
1.
Reviewed
and discussed the audited financial statements with management, and
2.
Reviewed
and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from our independent auditors on the matters relating to the auditor’s
independence.
Based
upon the board of directors’ review and discussion of the matters above, the board of directors authorized inclusion of the audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, to be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and filed with the SEC.
Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered
class of the Company’s equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership
of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial shareholders
are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To the best of our knowledge based solely
on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 (and any amendments thereof) received by us, no persons have failed to file, on a timely basis, the
identified reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
Code
of Ethics
As
of December 31, 2023, we had not adopted a Code of Ethics. We believe that the small number of board and management members do not yet
warrant the adoption of a Code of Ethics.

NOTE
1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS
The Company
Resonate
Blends, Inc. formerly Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on in October 1984 in the State of Georgia
as Brock Control Systems. Founded by Richard T. Brock, the Company was in the sales automation market and an early developer of enterprise

Brock International Inc., and in March of 1998, the Company again changed its’ name to Firstwave Technologies, Inc.
In
2007, the Company deregistered its common stock in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company. The Company reported briefly
on the OTC Disclosure & News Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.
On
October 28, 2013, the Company held a shareholder meeting to reincorporate the company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change
its name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. The Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of its outstanding common stock.
On

($10,000,000.00) for any three (3) consecutive month trailing period; and (iii) such number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock that
will convert into 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock in the Company on a fully-diluted basis upon the occurrence of the Company’s
public market value reaching One Hundred Million US Dollars ($100,000,000). The shares in (ii) and (iii) shall have anti-dilution protections,
except that this provision only applies for 2.5% of the outstanding shares acquired under each subsection.
Also,

with Entourage Labs, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Entourage Labs”), and the members of Entourage Labs. As
a result of the transaction, Entourage Labs became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, at the closing an aggregate of 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock for a total of 665,072 shares
were issued to the holders of Entourage Labs in exchange for their membership interests of Entourage Labs. These shares have anti-dilution
protection. We have also agreed as part of the purchase price to issue: (ii) such number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock that will

of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for any three (3) consecutive month trailing period; and (iii) such number of shares of Series
E Preferred Stock that will convert into 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock in the Company on a fully-diluted basis upon the
occurrence of the Company’s public market value reaching One Hundred Million US Dollars ($100,000,000). The shares in (ii) and
(iii) shall have anti-dilution protections, except that this provision only applies for 2.5% of the outstanding shares acquired under
each subsection.
F-6
In
addition, the Company entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations (the “Conveyance
Agreement”) with Mark S. Johnson and the Company’s 49% owned subsidiary, Aspire Consulting Group, LLC, a Virginia limited
liability company. Pursuant to the Conveyance Agreement, the Company transferred all assets and business operations associated with its
IT consulting solutions, including all of the capital stock of Aspire Consulting, to Mr. Johnson. In exchange, Mr. Johnson agreed to
cancel 20,000 shares of common stock in the Company and to assume and cancel all liabilities relating to the Company’s former business.
On
December 16, 2019 the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to effectuate a merger with its
wholly owned subsidiary; Resonate Blends, Inc. Shareholder approval was not required under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
As part of the merger, the Company’s board of directors authorized a change in our name to “Resonate Blends, Inc.”
and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation have been amended to reflect this name change.
In
connection with the name change, the Company’s symbol was changed to “KOAN” that more resembles the Company’s
new business focus.
Effective
March 14, 2024, Geoffrey Selzer, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and Jim Morrison, the Company’s
past President and Director, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Selzer sold all 2,000,000 outstanding
shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock to Mr. Morrison for $10.00 in cash. Mr. Morrison now possesses voting control
of the Company.
On
February 26, 2024, the Company entered into entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, as amended, with Emergent Health Corp., a Wyoming
corporation (EMGE), and the holders (the “EMGE Preferred Shareholders”) of Series Class A Preferred Stock and the Series
C Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock. On March 14, 2024, the parties closed the Exchange Agreement. At the closing of the Exchange
Agreement: (a) the EMGE Preferred Shareholders exchanged all of their respective EMGE Equity Interests for an equal number of shares
of the Company’s to-be-designated Series F Convertible Preferred Stock that shall convert into 93% of the common stock of the Company
on a fully-diluted basis (the “Series F Preferred Stock”), which shares of Series F Preferred Stock are currently issuable
to the EMGE Preferred Shareholders and are to be issued upon the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Designation with the State
of Nevada; (b) the Company consummated the Conveyance Agreement; and (c) all persons serving as directors and officers of the Company
prior to the consummation of the Exchange Agreement resigned and appointed four new members of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Effective
August 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Reformation of Share Exchange Agreement (the “Reformation Agreement”) with EMGE
and the EMGE Preferred Shareholders. The Reformation Agreement was entered into after the Company, EMGE and the EMGE Preferred Shareholders
having independently determined that the structure of the Exchange Agreement resulted in the parties’ experiencing consequences
that were unintended and that would not, in the long term, be beneficial to the parties and that a reformation of the Exchange Agreement
from a share-for-share structure to a share-for-asset structure would be beneficial to each of the parties.
By
the Reformation Agreement, share-for-share structure of the Exchange Agreement was reformed to become a share-for-asset structure (the
“Reformation”). Effecting the Reformation produced the following actions (the “Reformation Actions”):
(a)
First,
the issuances of the Company Exchange Shares to the EMGE Preferred Shareholders were rescinded.
(b)
Next,
the assignments of the EMGE Equity Interests by the EMGE Preferred Shareholders to the Company were rescinded.
(c)
The
Company, then, re-issued the Exchange Shares to EMGE, in consideration of the following assets of EMGE (the “Acquired Assets”):
●
All
of the capital stock of Evolutionary Biologics, Inc.;
●
All
of the capital stock of Apollo Biowellness, Inc.;
●
All
of the capital stock of Nanosthetic, Inc.; and
●
All
of the capital stock of Nanogistics, Inc.
In
addition, the Reformation Actions resulted in the Company’s no longer being the controlling shareholder of EMGE.
On
March 14, 2024, in conjunction with the acquisition of EMGE, we entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Subsidiary
with two of the Company’s then-wholly-owned subsidiaries, Resonate Blends, LLC, a California limited liability company, and Entourage
Labs, LLC, a California limited liability company, and our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Geoffrey Selzer. Pursuant to
the Conveyance Agreement, the Company assigned its’ ownership in the Subsidiary to Mr. Selzer. In consideration of our assignment
of the Subsidiary, Mr. Selzer (a) assumed and agreed to pay, perform and discharge, fully and completely, all liabilities of the Subsidiary,
(b) indemnified us for any loss arising from or in connection with any of such liabilities and
(c)
agreed to pay the Company (i) 20% of any proceeds from the sale of the Subsidiary that occurs prior to the one-year anniversary of the Conveyance Agreement and (ii) 10% of any proceeds from the sale of the Subsidiary that occurs after the one-year anniversary and prior to the two-year anniversary of the Conveyance Agreement.
F-7
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on
Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position and the results of operations for the period presented have been reflected herein. Notes to the financial statements
which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period,
as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.
Going
concern
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $28,869,611. The company’s ability to continue as a going concern
is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable
operations. While the Company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity
will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Consolidation
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Cash
The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The
Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.
Accounts
receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts
Accounts
receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer
receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical
collection information and existing economic conditions. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, there’s no allowance for doubtful accounts
and bad debts.
F-8
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the core principle of which is that the
Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for
arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps:
●
Identification
of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
●
Identification
of the performance obligations in the contract
●
Determination
of the transaction price
●
Allocation
of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Recognition
of the revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied
Revenue
is generally recognized upon purchase of products by customers.
EMGE
sells ingestible and topical products to retail customers across the United States of America. The Company’s standard delivery
method is “free on board” shipping point. Consequently, the Company considers control of products to transfer at a single
point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when products are shipped in accordance with an agreement
or purchase order. Control is defined as the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the
product. The Company considers the customer’s purchase order, and the Company’s corresponding sales order acknowledgement
as the contract with the customer. For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products to be the identified performance
obligations. The Company satisfies its performance obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring goods and services in
exchange for monetary consideration from the customer. Sales taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities
are excluded from revenue.
Revenue
is deferred when the Company receives payment under a contract with a customer prior to satisfying its performance obligation. As the
majority of orders are processed and shipped immediately upon receipt of payment, it is rare that revenue is deferred. There was no deferred
revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Significant
payment terms – The Company’s contracts with its customers state the final terms of the sale, including the description,
quantity, and price of each product purchased. Payments are typically due prior to delivery. Since the customer agrees to a stated rate
and price in the contract that do not vary over the contract, the Company’s contracts do not contain variable consideration. Economic
factors - The Company’s revenues and accounts receivable are derived primarily from the United States with no particular concentration
in any industry. Sales revenue is impacted by overall economic conditions, as there are fewer sales when the Company’s customers
are impacted by negative economic conditions. Returns, refunds, and warranties – The Company has a 30-day return policy on all
products. As the amount of returned product is minimal, management believes that returns on any goods sold subsequent to December 31,
2024, and 2023, were not material.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the respective fair values
due to the short maturities of these items.
As
required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in
active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly;
and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
F-9
The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that is observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability;
Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).
Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.

Inventory
Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis. Management compares the cost
of inventory with the net realizable value and, if applicable, an allowance is made for writing down the inventory to its net realizable
value, if lower than cost, inventory is reviewed for potential write-down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based
upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions. Generally, the Company only keeps inventory on hand for sales made and in which
a deposit has been received.
Net
income (loss) per Common Share
Basic
net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except
that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
Property
and equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, which range from three3 to seven years. Expenditures for renewals or betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense as incurred the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the
accounts, and any gain or loss thereon is reflected in operations. Company policies capitalize property and equipment for cost over $1,000,
asset acquired under $1,000 are charge to operations.
Income
Taxes
Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized. Because the Company has no net income, the tax benefit of the accumulated net loss has been
fully offset by an equal valuation allowance.
F-10
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock
Compensation which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense
and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.
The
Company follows ASC Topic 505-50, formerly EITF 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees
for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services,” for stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other
non-employees. In accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services provided to
the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or
warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense
and additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.
NOTE
3 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Management
has periodically advanced funds to the Company for operating expenses. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts due related

Conveyance Agreement, we assigned our ownership in the Subsidiary to Mr. Selzer. In consideration of our assignment of the Subsidiary,
Mr. Selzer (a) assumed and agreed to pay, perform and discharge, fully and completely, all liabilities of the Subsidiary, (b) indemnified
us for any loss arising from or in connection with any of such liabilities and (c) agreed to pay us (i) 20% of any proceeds from the sale of the Subsidiary that occurs prior to the one-year anniversary of the Conveyance Agreement and (ii) 10% of any proceeds from the sale of the Subsidiary that occurs after the one-year anniversary and prior to the two-year anniversary of the Conveyance Agreement.

stock underlying the Vollintine Warrant.
NOTE
5 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
Certain
of the above convertible notes contained an embedded conversion option with a conversion price that could result in issuing an undeterminable
amount of future common stock to settle the host contract. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is required to be bifurcated from
the host instrument (convertible note) and treated as a liability, which is calculated at fair value, and marked to market at each reporting
period.
The
Company used the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of its embedded conversion option and warrant liabilities on
both the commitment date and the remeasurement date with the following inputs:
