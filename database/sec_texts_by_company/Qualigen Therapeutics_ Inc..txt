CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements by Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. that
involve risks and uncertainties and reflect our judgment as of the date of this Annual Report. These statements generally relate to future
events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”
“could,” “intends,” “target,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar
terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Such forward-looking statements may relate to, among
other things, potential future development, testing and launch of products and product candidates. Actual events or results may differ
from our expectations due to a number of factors.
These
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:
●
our
ability to procure sufficient working capital to continue and complete the development, testing and launch of our prospective drug
products;
●
our
ability to successfully develop any drugs;
●
our
ability to progress our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical development;
●
our
ability to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our clinical trials and to begin and complete such trials according to any
projected timeline;
●
our
ability to complete enrollment in our clinical trials as contemplated by any projected timeline;
●
the
likelihood that future clinical trial data will be favorable or that such trials will confirm any improvements over other products
or lack negative impacts;
●
our
ability to successfully commercialize any drugs;
●
the
likelihood that patents will issue on our in-licensed patent applications;
●
our
ability to protect our intellectual property; and
●
our
ability to compete.
By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics, and healthcare,
regulatory and scientific developments and depend on the economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur
on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should
not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each
forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which
we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. In addition, even if our results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent in some future
periods with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in
other future periods. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Annual Report speaks only as of the date of this Annual Report,
and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements beyond the date of this Annual Report, except as
required by law. This caution is made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Future
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), future press releases and future oral or written statements
made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may also contain forward-looking statements. Because such
statements include risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, actual results may differ materially from those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we
undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they
are made.

PART
I
ITEM
1. BUSINESS
Overview
We
are an early-clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancer. Our business now consists
of one early-clinical-stage therapeutic program (QN-302) and one preclinical therapeutic program (Pan-RAS).
In
addition, on April 11, 2024, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement (the “Co-Development Agreement”) with Marizyme, Inc.
(“Marizyme”). The Co-Development Agreement contemplated that we would invest an aggregate of $800,000 in Marizyme in April
2024 (the “Funding Payment”) and pay Marizyme a $200,000 Exclusivity Fee (Provided, that if the parties so agree the total
Funding Payment can be increased from time to time to up to a total of $1,500,000.) To date our Funding Payment investment has been $500,000,
and in July 2024 we have advanced an additional $1,250,000 pursuant to an 18% demand promissory note, and in August 2024 we amended the
Co-Development Agreement to increase the total Funding Payment to up to a total of $1,750,000.
The Funding Payment is designed to provide
financial support for commercialization of Marizyme’s DuraGraft™ vascular conduit solution, which is indicated for adult
patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage of the saphenous vein grafts
used in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. In return for the Funding Payment we will receive quarterly a 33% payment in the nature
of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of DuraGraft, capped at double the
amount of the Funding Payment cash provided. No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue until after DuraGraft has been
launched in the United States and a cumulative total of $500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made in the United States.
The
Exclusivity Fee entitled us to an exclusivity period until May 31, 2024 (the “Exclusivity Period”) for purposes of proposing
and outlining a broader strategic relationship with Marizyme with regard to Marizyme’s DuraGraft business. The Exclusivity Period
has ended, and we do not intend to expand the Exclusivity Period.
Our
lead program, QN-302, is an investigational small molecule G-quadruplexes (G4)-selective transcription inhibitor with strong binding
affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells (such as pancreatic cancer). Such binding could, by stabilizing the G4s against DNA “unwinding,”
help inhibit cancer cell proliferation. QN-302 is currently undergoing a Phase 1a clinical trial at START Midwest in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
and HonorHealth in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Our
Pan-RAS program, which is currently at the preclinical stage, consists of a family of RAS oncogene protein-protein interaction inhibitor
small molecules believed to inhibit or block mutated RAS genes’ proteins from binding to their effector proteins thereby leaving
the proteins from the mutated RAS unable to cause further harm. In theory, such mechanism of action may be effective in the treatment
of about one quarter of all cancers, including certain forms of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. The investigational compounds
within our Pan-RAS portfolio are designed to suppress the interaction of endogenous RAS with c-RAF, upstream of the KRAS, HRAS and NRAS
effector pathways.
On
May 22, 2020, we completed a “reverse recapitalization” transaction with Qualigen, Inc. (not to be confused with the Company);
pursuant to which our merger subsidiary merged with and into Qualigen, Inc. with Qualigen, Inc. surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. The Company, which had previously been known as Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was renamed Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc.,
and the former stockholders of Qualigen, Inc. acquired, via the recapitalization, a substantial majority of the shares of the Company.
Ritter/Qualigen Therapeutics common stock, which was previously traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “RTTR,”
commenced trading on Nasdaq, on a post-reverse-stock-split adjusted basis, under the ticker symbol “QLGN” on May 26, 2020.
We are no longer pursuing the gastrointestinal disease treatment business on which Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. had focused before the
reverse recapitalization transaction.
On
July 20, 2023, we sold our Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary, which contained our former FastPack® diagnostics business to Chembio
Diagnostics, Inc. (“Chembio”), an American subsidiary of French diagnostics provider Biosynex, S.A. The aggregate net purchase
price for Qualigen, Inc. was $5.4 million in cash, of which $450,000 was being held in escrow to satisfy certain of our indemnification
obligations until January 20, 2025. On June 4, 2024, the $450,000 escrow account was settled early and liquidated by mutual agreement
between us and Chembio. In exchange for the early settlement, $350,000 was paid to the Company, and $100,000 was paid to Chembio. This
settlement resulted in a $100,000 loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024.
Minority
Interest in NanoSynex
We
own a minority interest in NanoSynex, Ltd. (“NanoSynex”), a privately-held microbiologics diagnostic company domiciled in
Israel. NanoSynex’s technology is for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing that aims to enable better targeting of antibiotics
for their most suitable uses to ultimately result in faster and more efficacious treatment, hence reducing hospitals’ mortality
and morbidity rates. On May 26, 2022, we acquired a 52.8% interest in NanoSynex from our related party Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”)
and NanoSynex, and entered into a Master Agreement for the Operational and Technological Funding of NanoSynex with NanoSynex (the “NanoSynex
Funding Agreement”). On July 20, 2023, we entered into an Amendment and Settlement Agreement with NanoSynex (the “NanoSynex
Amendment”), pursuant to which we agreed to, in exchange for eliminating all future NanoSynex Funding Agreement obligations for
us to invest further cash in NanoSynex (except for obligations to lend NanoSynex $560,000 on or before November 30, 2023, and $670,000
on or before March 31, 2024), surrender 281,000 Series B Preferred Shares of NanoSynex held by us, resulting in our ownership in NanoSynex
being reduced from approximately 52.8% to approximately 49.97% of the voting equity of NanoSynex; in addition, we agreed to surrender
approximately $3.0 million of promissory notes which NanoSynex had issued to us under the Funding Agreement. On November 22, 2023 we
further agreed to eliminate our obligations to lend NanoSynex $560,000 on or before November 30, 2023, and $670,000 on or before March
31, 2024, by instead surrendering shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of NanoSynex in an amount that reduced our ownership in NanoSynex
voting equity from approximately 49.97% to 39.90%.

Amendment
to Certificate of Designation of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
On
December 23, 2024, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A-2
Preferred Stock (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of Delaware, following
approval by the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”) and by the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding shares
of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A-2 Preferred Stock”). The Amended and Restated Certificate
of Designation amends certain provisions of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, specifically to prohibit any adjustment to the conversion
price unless approved by a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5635(d).
November
2024 Preferred Stock Offering
We
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “November Securities Purchase Agreement”) on November 18, 2024 with certain
institutional and accredited investors (the “Investors”). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed
to sell and issue shares of Qualigen’s newly designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Qualigen
Series A-2 Preferred Stock”), in a private placement transaction (the “November Private Placement”). The closing of
the November Private Placement was on November 20, 2024. We sold and issued to the Investors 5,100 shares of Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred
Stock at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $5.1 million.
Each
share of Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred Stock was, at any time at the option of the holder, convertible into a number of shares of the
Company’s common stock equal to $1,000 shares divided by a conversion price initially equal to $3.64, subject to adjustment for
any stock splits, stock dividends and similar events and also subject to “ratchet” antidilution adjustment (subject to certain
customary exceptions), provided that any conversion of Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred Stock by a holder into shares of the Company’s
common stock would be prohibited if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates and any other person or
entity whose beneficial ownership of the common stock would be aggregated with such holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of the Company’s
common stock issued and outstanding after giving effect to such conversion. Upon written notice to the Company, the holder could from
time to time increase or decrease such limitation to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice. Each share
of Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred Stock was entitled to a preference of $1,000 per share upon liquidation of the Company. Without consent
of the holders of at least 67% of the Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred Stock, The Company could not amend its charter documents to materially
and adversely affect the rights of the Qualigen Series A-2 Preferred Stock, repurchase certain junior securities of the Company, pay
cash dividends on junior securities of us or (unless it is at arm’s-length and is approved by a majority of our disinterested directors)
enter into a material transaction with an affiliate of us.
Exchange
Agreement with Chen
On
November 18, 2024, we entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Yi Hua Chen (“Chen”)
pursuant to which we issued 1,154 shares of our newly-designated Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share.
The shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock was issued in exchange for the conversion of the $1,100,000 convertible notes issued on April
12, 2024.
Reverse
Stock Split
On
November 5, 2024, we implemented a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of the issued shares of its common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”),
effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on November 5, 2024. Our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened
on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “QLGN.” The new CUSIP
number for the common stock is 74754R301.
The
Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the bid price of the common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company’s stockholders authorized the Reverse Stock
Split at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on October 25, 2024, with the final ratio subsequently determined by
the Board.
5
As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 50 shares of the Company’s pre-split common stock issued and outstanding were automatically
reclassified into one new share of the Company’s common stock. This reduced the number of shares outstanding from 36,837,020 shares
to 736,431 shares as of November 5, 2024. The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock will remain unchanged.
Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will receive cash (without interest or deduction) in lieu
of such fractional shares, after aggregating all the fractional interests of such holder resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. Proportionate
adjustments will be made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company’s equity plans and grants thereunder,
as applicable. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the par value of the common stock.
All share numbers and exercise prices in this document have been adjusted
for the Reverse Stock Split.
IR
Agency LLC Consulting Agreement
We
entered into a consulting agreement (the “IR Agency Consulting Agreement”) with IR Agency, LLC (“IR Agency”),
a provider of investor relations-related services on October 9, 2024. Pursuant to the IR Agency Consulting Agreement, we have engaged
IR Agency, on a non-exclusive basis, to prepare marketing and advertising materials.
As
consideration for its performance under the IR Agency Consulting Agreement, we will pay IR Agency a fee of $800,000 upon the Company
raising $1.8 million or more in an equity financing over the thirty (30) days. IR Agency is not a registered broker-dealer or investment
advisor and will not engage in any activities on behalf of us that would require it to be registered as a broker-dealer or investment
advisor.
The
IR Agency Consulting Agreement will have a term of one (1) month and may be terminated by written notice, with or without cause, by us
at any time.
Upon
the closing of the November 2024 Preferred Stock Offering, the Consulting Agreement (the “IR Agency Consulting Agreement”)
dated October 9, 2024, between the Company and IR Agency, LLC (“IR Agency”), a provider of investor relations services, became
effective. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, $800,000 of the proceeds has been paid to IR Agency for services to be rendered up until the third quarter of 2025.
September
2024 Public Offering
On
September 5, 2024, we entered into a placement agency agreement (the “September Placement Agent Agreement”) with
Univest Securities, LLC (“Univest”), to sell the September Shares (as defined below) to certain institutional investors that
were included in a public offering (the “September Offering”) of 294,481 shares of common stock (each a “September Share,” and collectively, the “September Shares”) at public offering price
of $6.50 per September Share and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 239,455 shares at a price of $6.45 per share with an exercise
price of $0.05 per share (the “September Pre-Funded Warrants”). The September Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable upon issuance
and will remain exercisable until all the September Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full.
The
closing of the September Offering occurred on September 6, 2024, and the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of $3.47 million,
before payment of placement agent fees and expenses and other transaction costs. At the closing of the September Offering, the Company
also issued to Univest, the exclusive placement agent in the September Offering, a warrant to purchase 16,018 Shares (the “September
Placement Agent Warrant”), pursuant to the September Placement Agent Agreement. The September Placement Agent Warrant has a term
of five years commencing from the date of sales in the September Offering, is exercisable after 180 days after issuance, and has an exercise
price of $7.80 per share of common stock. We paid Univest a cash fee equal to 3% of the gross proceeds received in the September
Offering and certain other amounts for reimbursement of expenses incurred by Univest in connection with the September Offering.
February
2024 Private Placement
On
February 26, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “February Purchase Agreement”) with Alpha. The
transactions contemplated by the February Purchase Agreement closed on February 27, 2024, at which time we delivered to Alpha a new
debenture and warrant, as described in this paragraph, and Alpha paid us a cash purchase price of $500,000 (less expenses). Pursuant
to the February Purchase Agreement, we issued to Alpha an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Debenture”) in the
principal amount of $550,000. The 2024 Debenture has a maturity date of December 31, 2024 and was convertible from time to time, at
Alpha’s option, into shares of common stock, at $6.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2024 Debenture. The
2024 Debenture accrues interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of 8% per annum, payable at maturity. Pursuant to
the terms of the February Purchase Agreement, we also issued to Alpha a 5-year common stock purchase warrant to purchase 18,001
shares of common stock at $13.00 per share. We also granted to Alpha an option (the “Option”) that was exercisable until
July 1, 2024, to purchase from us additional 8% Convertible Debentures, of like tenor, with face amounts of up to an aggregate of
$1,100,000 (and with a proportional number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor, up to a total of 36,001 additional
warrants), which would (if and when Alpha exercises such option) provide us up to an additional $1.0 million in cash proceeds (less
expense reimbursement, and not including any possible cash proceeds from any future exercise of the additional warrants). Alpha assigned the Option to Chen in April 2024.

QN-302
We
exclusively in-licensed the global rights to the G-Quadruplex (“G4”) selective transcription inhibitor platform from University
College London (“UCL”) in January 2022. The licensed technology comprises lead compound QN-302 (formerly known as SOP1812)
and back-up compounds that target regulatory regions of cancer genes that down-regulate gene expression in multiple cancer pathways.
Developed by Dr. Stephen Neidle and his group at UCL, the G4 binding concept is derived from nucleic acid research conducted over more
than over 30 years, including research on G4s, which are higher order DNA and RNA structures formed by sequences containing guanine-rich
repeats. G4s are overrepresented in telomeres (a region of repetitive DNA sequences at the end of a chromosome) as well as promoter sequences
and untranslated regions of many oncogenes. Their prevalence is therefore significantly greater in cancer cells compared to normal human
cells.
G4-selective
small molecules such as QN-302 and backup compounds target the regulatory regions of cancer genes, which have a high prevalence of enriched
G4s. Stable G4-QN-302 complexes can be impediments to replication, transcription or translation of those cancer genes containing G4s,
and the drugs’ binding to G4s are believed to stabilize the G4s against possible “unwinding.” G4 binders like QN-302
could be efficacious in a variety of cancer types with a high prevalence of G4s.
We
believe that QN-302 has the potential to demonstrate superior efficacy and activity against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”),
which represents 98% of pancreatic cancers. Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common in women,
but it is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in men and the third leading cause in women; it accounts for about 3% of all cancers
in the United States but is responsible for about 8% of all cancer-related deaths. It has one of the lowest rates of survival of all
cancer types.
In-vitro
and in-vivo studies have shown that G4 stabilization by QN-302 resulted in inhibition of target gene expression and cessation
of cell growth in various cancers, including PDAC. In in-vitro studies, QN-302 was potent in inhibiting the growth of several
PDAC cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations. Similarly, in in-vivo studies, QN-302 showed a longer survival duration in a
KPC genetic mouse model for pancreatic cancer than gemcitabine (the current standard of care for PDAC) has historically shown. Additional
preclinical in-vivo studies suggest activity in gemcitabine-resistant PDAC. Data further demonstrated that QN-302 had significant
anti-tumor activity in three patient-derived PDAC xenograft models. Early safety indicators in pancreatic cancer mouse in-vivo
models suggest no significant adverse toxic effects at proposed therapeutic doses.
On
January 9, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) to QN-302
for the indication of pancreatic cancer. ODD provides advantages to pharmaceutical companies that are developing investigational drugs
or biological products that show promise in treating rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United
States, including seven-year marketing exclusivity and eligibility to receive regulatory support and guidance from the FDA in the design
of an overall drug development plan.
There
are also economic advantages to receiving ODD, including a 25% federal tax credit for expenses incurred in conducting clinical research
on the orphan designated product within the United States. Tax credits may be applied to the prior year or applied to up to 20 years
of future taxes. ODD recipients may also have their Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fees waived, a potential savings
of around $3.2 million (as of fiscal year 2023) for applications requiring covered clinical data, and may qualify to compete for research
grants from the Office of Orphan Products Development that support clinical studies.
On
August 1, 2023 we announced that the FDA had cleared our investigational new drug (“IND”) application for QN-302, and on
November 1, 2023 the first patient in our Phase 1a clinical trial for QN-302 was dosed at START Midwest in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
We
will require additional cash resources to be able to continue and complete this Phase 1a clinical trial.
Pan-RAS
(formerly referred to as RAS or RAS-F)
In
July 2020 we entered into an exclusive worldwide in-license agreement with the University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc. (“UofL”)
for the intellectual property covering the “RAS” family of pan-RAS inhibitor small molecule drug candidates, which are believed
to work by blocking RAS mutations directly, thereby inhibiting tumor formation (especially in pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers).
Pursuant to the license agreement, we will seek to identify and develop a lead drug candidate from the compound family and, upon commercialization,
will pay UofL royalties in the low-to-mid-single-digit percentages on net sales of Pan-RAS inhibitor licensed products. The license agreement
with UofL for Pan-RAS was amended in March 2021 and June 2023.

RAS
is the most common oncogene in human cancer. Activating mutations in one of the three human RAS gene isoforms (KRAS, HRAS or NRAS) are
present in about one-fourth to one-third of all cancers. For example, mutant KRAS is found in 98% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas,
52% of colon cancers, and 32% of lung adenocarcinomas. For these three cancer types, cancers with mutant KRAS are diagnosed in more than
170,000 people each year in the United States and cause more than 120,000 deaths. Drugs that target signaling downstream of RAS are available;
however, such drugs have shown disappointing clinical durability because RAS is a “hub” that activates multiple effectors,
so drugs that block a single pathway downstream may not account for the many other activated pathways.
We
also had a sponsored research agreement with UofL for Pan-RAS research; that agreement expired in December 2023.
On
February 15, 2024, we entered into a License and Sublicense Agreement with Pan-RAS Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation (“Pan-RAS
Holdings”), which contemplated an exclusive out-license of our Pan-RAS drug development program, including our rights under the
UofL license agreement, Pan-RAS Holdings. Although the License and Sublicense Agreement called for a closing by March 16, 2024, the License
and Sublicense Agreement was in essence structured as a 30-day option in favor of Pan-RAS Holdings. At the contemplated closing, Pan-RAS
Holdings would have paid us an upfront fee of $1,000,000 in cash. In addition, Pan-RAS Holdings would have become responsible to pay
on our behalf our in-license royalty obligations to UofL, as and when required. Finally, if the contemplated closing had occurred, Pan-RAS
Holdings would have been required to pay to us for our own account, on a semiannual basis, royalties equal to 1.0% of net sales of any
RAS products. We would have owed certain amounts to UofL under our in-license agreement from them, if, as and when we received any Non-Royalty
Sublicensing Income from Pan-RAS Holdings.
Pan-RAS
Holdings did not effectuate the closing by March 16, 2024, and we and they voluntarily terminated the License and Sublicense Agreement
effective as of March 16, 2024.
Previous
Programs
We
have discontinued all of our efforts as to the following programs, and we do not plan to resume them:
1.
QN-247 (formerly referred
to as ALAN or AS1411-GNP) – an oligonucleotide aptamer-based, nucleolin-inhibiting anticancer drug candidate, consisting
of QN-165 conjugated with gold nanoparticles.
2.
QN-165 (formerly referred to as AS1411)
– an oligonucleotide aptamer-based drug candidate for the potential broad-spectrum treatment of infectious diseases such as
COVID-19.
3.
Selective Target Antigen Removal System (STARS)
– a therapeutic blood-filtering device product concept, which would be designed to remove circulating tumor cells,
viruses, inflammation factors and immune checkpoints.
Research
and Development
For
research and development of our drug candidates, we have historically leveraged the scientific and technical resources and laboratory
facilities of UofL and UCL, through technology licensing, sponsored research, and other consulting agreements. We have engaged contract
research organizations (“CROs”) and clinical sites for the Phase 1a clinical trial of QN-302. We intend to focus our internal
research and development on oversight of these CROs. We currently have no internal research and development facilities.
Regulatory
Matters
We
have obtained FDA clearance/approval for our QN-302 Phase 1a clinical trial. We have not obtained FDA or other regulatory approval for
any other drug candidate.
United
States—FDA Drug Approval Process
The
research, development, testing, and manufacture of product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United
States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and its implementing
regulations.
The
steps required to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include, among others:
●
preclinical laboratory tests, animal
studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
●
submission to the FDA of an IND application for human
clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and for which progress reports must be submitted
annually to the FDA;
8
●
approval by
an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or Ethics Committee (“EC”) at each clinical trial site
before each trial may be initiated;
●
adequate and well-controlled
human clinical trials, conducted in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), and
other clinical trial related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication to the FDA’s
satisfaction;
●
submission to the FDA of
a New Drug Application (“NDA”) and payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
●
satisfactory completion
of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more clinical trial site(s) at which the drug was studied in a clinical trial(s) and/or
of us as a clinical trial sponsor to assess compliance with GCP regulations;
●
satisfactory completion
of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance
with current GMPs regulations;
●
agreement with the FDA
on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy;
and
●
FDA review and approval
of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable, based on a determination that the
drug is safe and effective for the proposed indication(s).
Preclinical
tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical
tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of
an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. We cannot be certain that submission of an IND
application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
Clinical
trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined.
The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an IRB for each institution
where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the study until completion. Study subjects must provide informed consent
and sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy the extensive GCP regulations
for, among other things, informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
●
Phase 1—Phase
1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the study drug in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients
with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism
and distribution of the study drug in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain
early evidence of effectiveness.
●
Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical
trials typically involve administration of the study drug to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to
evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information before beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical
trials.
●
Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical
trials typically involve administration of the study drug to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide
substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical
trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the study drug and to provide an adequate
basis for product approval. Generally, adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval
of an NDA.
The
FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval,
which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development, and the FDA’s review of drugs (e.g., approving
an NDA on the basis of surrogate endpoints subject to post-approval trials). Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of
these programs are those intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet
medical needs for those disease or conditions, and/or those that provide a meaningful benefit over existing treatments. For example,
a sponsor may be granted FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug candidate is intended,
alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical
evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant
endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy,
the FDA will take actions to help expedite the development and review of such drug. Moreover, if a sponsor submits an NDA for a product
intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat, and that
meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent
NDA. From time to time, we anticipate applying for such programs where we believe we meet the applicable FDA criteria. A company cannot
be sure that any of its drugs will qualify for any of these programs, or even if a drug does qualify, that the review time will be reduced.
9
The
results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the
manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for
one or more proposed indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Unless
the applicant qualifies for an exemption, the filing of an NDA typically must be accompanied by a substantial “user fee”
payment to the FDA. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety
and efficacy of the product in the proposed patient population to the satisfaction of the FDA. After an NDA is accepted for filing, the
FDA substantively reviews the application and may deem it to be inadequate, and companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted
on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians,
for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, but is not bound by the recommendations
of the advisory committee.
Before
approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and determine whether
the manufacturing and production and testing facilities are in compliance with cGMP regulations. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product
approval if, among other things, ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, certain defects exist in the NDA, or safety or efficacy
problems occur after the product reaches the market.

Going
Concern Qualification
Our
working capital deficiency, stockholders’ equity deficit, and recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph
in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 with respect to this uncertainty. Our ability to continue
as a going concern will require us to obtain additional funding.

Corporate
Information
Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (our predecessor) was formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under the name Ritter Natural
Sciences, LLC. In September 2008, this company converted into a Delaware corporation under the name Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On May
22, 2020, upon completing the “reverse recapitalization” transaction with Qualigen, Inc., Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was
renamed Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. and Qualigen, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 20, 2023 we sold Qualigen,
Inc. to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc., an American subsidiary of French diagnostics provider Biosynex S.A.
Our
principal executive offices are located at 5857 Owens Avenue, Suite 300, Carlsbad, CA 92008. Our telephone number is (760) 452-8111.
Our corporate website address is www.qlgntx.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through,
our website will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and are not considered part of, this Annual Report. You should not
rely on our website or any such information in making your decision whether to purchase our securities.
We
make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to
those reports, available on the investor relations portion of our website. The reports are free of charge and are available as soon as
reasonably possible after they are filed with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements
and other information regarding SEC registrants, including Qualigen.
We
are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage
of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
An
investment in our common stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other
information included in this Annual Report, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business. If any of the following
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks described
below, which are the risks we judge (rightly or wrongly) to be the most significant to investors, are not the only ones we face. Additional
risks that we currently do not judge to be among the “most significant” may also impair our business, financial condition,
operating results and prospects.
Risks
Related to Our Business
Various
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception, including a net loss of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024,
and has an accumulated deficit of $123.1 million as of December 31, 2024. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and to secure additional sources of equity and/or debt financing. Despite the
Company’s intent to fund operations through equity and debt financing arrangements, there is no assurance that such financing will
be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.
Our
independent auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report regarding the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. This going concern risk may materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt
or equity or may adversely affect the terms upon which such capital may be available. The inability to obtain sufficient financing on
acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and business
prospects.
The
Company is actively pursuing strategies to mitigate these risks. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prove successful
or that the Company will achieve its intended financial stability. The failure to successfully address these going concern risks may
materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Investors should consider
the substantial risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s business before investing in the Company’s securities.
Any
failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving
our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations.
Effective
internal controls, particularly those related to financial reporting, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we
cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our
reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, investors relying upon
this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or
other regulatory authorities or to stockholder class action securities litigation.
In connection
with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 audit”), our management
identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the lack of accounting department resources
and/or policies and procedures to ensure recording and disclosure of items in compliance with U.S. GAAP. This material weakness resulted
in adjustments to our prepaid expense accounts and recording short term notes receivable net of current expected credit losses in connection
with the 2024 audit. In response to the material weakness, we took a number of remediation steps to enhance our internal controls, including
implementing additional procedures and utilizing external consulting resources with experience and expertise in U.S. GAAP and public company
accounting and reporting requirements to assist management with its accounting and reporting of complex and/or non-recurring transactions
and related disclosures.
In connection with
the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 audit”), our management determined
that the material weakness identified in connection with the 2024 audit had not been fully remediated and resulted in adjustments to
the accounting treatment related to our prepaid expense accounts and recording short term
notes receivable net of current expected credit losses during the 2024 audit, which resulted in the late filing of the 2024 Annual
Report.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 audit, we identified the lack of sufficient number of personnel within the accounting function to adequately
segregate duties, the Company did not have a designed and implemented effective Information Technology General Controls (“ITGC”)
related to access controls to financial accounting system, and the Company did not have formalized documentation of its processes and
controls that could be evaluated for proper design and implementation.
We intend
to continue to take steps to enhance our internal controls, including implementing additional internal procedures and utilizing well-established
external consulting resources with experience and expertise in U.S. GAAP and public company accounting and reporting requirements.
If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses and achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting and effective disclosure controls, our business could be adversely affected.
Continued
uncertain economic conditions, including inflation and the risk of a global recession could impair our ability to forecast and may harm
our business, operating results, including our revenue growth and profitability, financial condition and cash flows.
While
U.S. inflation rates have come down substantially from their 2022 highs, the U.S. economy is still experiencing higher than target inflation
rates, and high levels of inflation persist in many countries around the world. Historically, we have not experienced significant inflation
risk in our business. The global economy suffers from slowing growth and elevated interest rates, and many economists are still unsure
whether a global recession may begin in the near future. If the global economy slows, our business would likely be adversely affected.
Our
business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity or a
natural disaster.
There
are growing risks related to the security, confidentiality and integrity of personal and corporate information stored and transmitted
electronically due to increasingly diverse and sophisticated threats to networks, systems and data security. Potential attacks span a
spectrum from attacks by criminal hackers, hacktivists, and nation state or state-sponsored actors, to employee malfeasance and human
or technological error.
Despite
the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely (including our vendors,
contractors and other third-party partners who process information on our behalf or have access to our systems), are vulnerable to damage
from computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, third
party or employee theft or misuse and other negligent actions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures,
cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, security incidents, disruptions, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization,
or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattacks
or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number,
intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur
and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. To the extent
that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure
of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims (including class claims) and liability, substantial
remediation costs, regulatory enforcement, liability under data protection laws, additional reporting requirements and damage to our
reputation, and the further development of our product lines could be delayed.
12
Our
future growth may be limited.
Our
ability to achieve our expansion objectives and to manage our growth effectively depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability
to attract and retain skilled employees, to successfully position and market our product candidates when available, to protect our existing
intellectual property, to capitalize on the potential opportunities we are pursuing with third parties and to acquire sufficient funding
whether internally or externally. To accommodate growth and compete effectively, we will need cash to fund our operations, including
continuing our research and development efforts on our product candidates, develop additional procedures and controls and increase, train,
motivate and manage our workforce. There is no assurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support
our potential future operations.
We
will need additional financing in order to grow our business.
From
time to time, in order to expand operations to meet customer demand, we will need to incur additional capital expenditures. These capital
expenditures are intended to be funded from third party sources, including the incurring of debt and/or the sale of additional equity
securities. In addition to requiring additional financing to fund capital expenditures, we may require additional financing to fund working
capital, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenditures and operating losses. The incurrence
of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of our operations. The sale of additional
equity securities will be dilutive to the interests of current equity holders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional
financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to us or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms. Any inability
to secure such additional financing on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and operating results.
Geopolitical
conditions, including direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
Our
operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other
similar events. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of current global conflicts, although such consequences can include
rising geopolitical tensions, rising regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyberattacks or the disruption of energy exports for
the parties involved, neighboring parties, or supporting parties of these conflicts or their resulting sanctions. Such consequences could
materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. These situations remain
uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, these conflicts and actions taken in response to
these conflicts could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional
capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We
are subject to litigation, which could result in significant expenses and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
On
January 29, 2025, Lifesci Capital LC (“Lifesci”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, alleging breach of contract and seeking damages in the amount of $503,483. We believe that no amount is owed to
Lifesci under the agreement at issue and are vigorously defending against the claims. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and
costly, and we cannot guarantee the outcome. An adverse result in this or other legal matters could materially impact our business, reputation,
financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks
related to regulatory approval
Even
if our development efforts are successful, we may not obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in the United States
or other jurisdictions, which would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for
our product candidates, any such approval may be subject to limitations, including with respect to the approved indications or patient
populations, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.
We
are not permitted to market or promote or sell any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable
foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Securing marketing
approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for
each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy for that indication. Securing marketing approval
also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection or remote regulatory assessment
of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites by, the regulatory authorities. If we do not receive approval from the FDA and comparable
foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize such product candidates in the
United States or in other jurisdictions. If significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing our product candidates occur
in any jurisdiction, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. Even
if our product candidates are approved, they may:
●
be subject to limitations on the
indicated uses or patient populations for which they may be marketed, distribution restrictions, or other conditions of approval;
13
●
contain significant safety warnings,
including boxed warnings, contraindications, and precautions;
●
not be approved with label statements necessary or
desirable for successful commercialization; or
●
contain requirements for costly post-market testing
and surveillance, or other requirements, including the submission of a REMS to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.
The
regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable.
If we are not able to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize
our product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue may be materially impaired.
The
time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years
following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory
authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change
during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions and there may be varying interpretations
of data obtained from preclinical studies or clinical trials, any of which may cause delays or limitations in the approval or a decision
not to approve an application. These regulatory requirements may require us to amend our clinical trial protocols, conduct additional
preclinical studies or clinical trials that may require regulatory or IRB approval, or otherwise cause delays in the approval or rejection
of an application. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate
revenue from the particular product candidate, which may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects.
If
we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a product candidate
does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial
prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate may be materially
impaired.
Changes
in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.
As
product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to later stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it
is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, facilities, equipment and formulation, are
altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform
differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such
changes may also require additional testing, or notification to, or approval by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority.
This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, require the repetition of
one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and/or jeopardize our ability to
commence product sales and generate revenue.
Regulatory
approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities is limited to those specific indications and conditions for which approval
has been granted, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, or other enforcement actions, including criminal
actions, if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or “off label” uses, resulting in damage
to our reputation and business.
We
must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Promotional communications with respect to therapeutics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and continuing
review by the FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, state attorneys
general, members of Congress, and the public. When the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities issue regulatory approval for
a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific uses and indications for which a product is approved. If we
are not able to obtain FDA approval for desired uses or indications for our product candidates, we may not market or promote them for
those indications and uses, referred to as off label uses, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price
and prospects may be materially harmed. We also must sufficiently substantiate any claims that we make for our products, including claims
comparing our products to other companies’ products, and must abide by the FDA’s strict requirements regarding the content
of promotion and advertising.
While
physicians may choose to prescribe products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ
from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products
for indications and uses that are not specifically approved by the FDA. These off label uses are common across medical specialties and
may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the United States generally
do not restrict or regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Regulatory authorities
do, however, restrict communications by biopharmaceutical companies concerning off label use.
14
If
we are found to have impermissibly promoted any of our product candidates, we may become subject to significant liability and government
fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations regarding product promotion, particularly those prohibiting
the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted a product may be subject to significant sanctions.
The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several
companies from engaging in off label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions
under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
In
the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products, following approval, for off label uses can also subject us
to false claims and other litigation under federal and state statutes. These include fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws, which
can lead to civil penalties, and criminal fines and agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which
we promote or distribute therapeutic products and conduct our business. These restrictions could include corporate integrity agreements
and non- or deferred prosecution agreements and could lead to exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs,
and suspension and debarment from government contracts and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. These False Claims
Act lawsuits against manufacturers of drugs and biologics have increased significantly in volume and breadth. In addition, False Claims
Act lawsuits may expose manufacturers to follow-on claims by private payers based on fraudulent marketing practices. This growth in litigation
has increased the risk that a biopharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claims action, pay civil penalties, criminal fines
or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, or other
federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, if any, we may become subject to such litigation
and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.
In
the United States, the promotion of biopharmaceutical products is subject to additional FDA requirements and restrictions on promotional
statements. If after one or more of our product candidates obtains marketing approval the FDA determines that our promotional activities
violate its regulations and policies pertaining to product promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject
us to regulatory or other enforcement actions, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of
an approved product from the market, requests for recalls, payment of civil fines, disgorgement of money, imposition of operating restrictions,
injunctions or criminal prosecution, and other enforcement actions. Similarly, industry codes in foreign jurisdictions may prohibit companies
from engaging in certain promotional activities and regulatory agencies in various countries may enforce violations of such codes with
civil penalties. If we become subject to regulatory and enforcement actions our business, financial condition, results of operations,
stock price and prospects will be materially harmed.
Even
if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which
may result in significant additional expense and limit how we manufacture and market our products.
Any
product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA
and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post approval clinical
data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, shortage reporting, risk management plans, supply chain security, storage,
recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such product. These requirements further include
submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and listing
requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements relating
to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and good clinical practices,
or GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post approval.
The
FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product even after approval.
If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates,
they may withdraw approval, issue public safety alerts, require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose
significant restrictions on a product’s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post
approval studies or post-market surveillance. Any such restrictions could limit sales of the product.
We
and any of our suppliers or collaborators, including our contract manufacturers, could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections
or remote regulatory assessments by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements. Application
holders must further notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA preapproval for product and manufacturing
changes.
In
addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or that the product is less effective than previously thought or other
problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and
after approval, may yield various negative results, including:
●
restrictions on manufacturing, distribution,
or marketing of such products;
●
restrictions on the labeling, including required additional
warnings, such as black boxed warnings, contraindications, precautions, and restrictions on the approved indication or use;
15
●
modifications to promotional pieces;
●
issuance of corrective information;
●
requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or other
clinical trials;
●
clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;
●
requirements to establish or modify a REMS or similar
strategy;
●
changes to the way the product candidate is administered;
●
liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;
●
reputational harm;
●
the product becoming less competitive;
●
warning, untitled, or cyber letters;
●
suspension of marketing or withdrawal of the products
from the market;
●
regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear
Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product
candidate;
●
refusal to approve pending applications or supplements
to approved applications that we submit;
●
recalls of products;
●
fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
●
suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
●
refusal to permit the import or export of our products;
●
product seizure or detention;
●
FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government
procurement and non-procurement programs, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare
programs, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, or non- or deferred prosecution agreements; or
●
injunctions, the imposition of civil penalties, criminal
fines, or imprisonment.
Any
of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, or
could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating
significant revenues from its marketing and sale. Any of these events could further have other material and adverse effects on our operations
and business and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.
The
FDA’s policies or those of comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted
that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, limit the marketability of our product candidates,
or impose additional regulatory obligations on us. Changes in medical practice and standard of care may also impact the marketability
of our product candidates.
If
we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements, standards of care, or the adoption of new requirements or policies,
or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and be subject
to regulatory enforcement action.
Should
any of the above actions take place, we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. Further, the cost
of compliance with post approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our
business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.
Risks
related to commercialization
We
face significant competition from other biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and
other research organizations, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more quickly or marketing
them more successfully than us. If their product candidates are shown to be safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunity
may be reduced or eliminated.
The
development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy products is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition
and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition
with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major biopharmaceutical companies,
specialty biopharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large biopharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of solid tumors, including
oncolytic immunotherapy and cancer vaccine approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies,
and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements
for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.
16
While
our product candidates are intended to be used in combination with other drugs with different mechanisms of action, if and when marketed
they will still compete with a number of drugs that are currently marketed or in development that also target cancer. To compete effectively
with these drugs, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages in clinical efficacy and safety compared to these competitors
when used alone or in combination with other drugs.
Our
commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,
have fewer or less severe side effects, are easier to administer or are less expensive alone or in combination with other therapies than
any products that we may develop alone or in combination with other therapies. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authority approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors
establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Further, depending on the specific competing product, earlier
approval of a competitor’s products could block us from receiving approval and could require that we change our development strategy.
In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors coverage decisions or third-party
intellectual property rights that another may allege are violated by our product candidates.
Certain
of the companies with which we are competing or may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise
in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing
approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more
resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors,
particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting
and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical
trials, as well as in developing or acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. If we are unable to successfully
compete with these companies our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed.
If
we are unable to establish effective marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market
and sell our product candidates, if they are approved, the revenues that we generate may be limited and we may never become profitable.
If
and when our product candidates receive marketing approval, we intend to commercialize our product candidates on our own in the United
States and potentially with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners in other geographies. In order to commercialize our products, we
must continue to build our marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services,
and we may not be successful in doing so. We have incurred and we expect we will continue to incur expenses prior to product launch or
even approval in order to recruit a sales force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure. If a commercial launch is delayed as
a result of FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements or other reasons, we would incur these expenses prior to being
able to realize any revenue from sales of our product candidates. Our sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing
our product candidates. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing
personnel.
We
may also or alternatively decide to collaborate with third-party marketing and sales organizations to commercialize any approved product
candidates in the United States, in which event, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited. To the extent we rely on third
parties to commercialize any products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized
these products ourselves, which could materially harm our prospects. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of
any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts, and could be held liable if they failed to comply with applicable
legal or regulatory requirements.
We
have no prior experience in the marketing, sale, and distribution of biopharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved
in building, managing, growing and operating a commercial infrastructure. The establishment and development of commercial capabilities,
including compliance plans, to market any products we may develop is, and will continue to be expensive and time consuming and could
delay any product launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability. We have and will continue to compete with other
biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including oncology-focused companies, to recruit, hire, train, manage, and retain marketing
and sales personnel, which is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. Developing our sales capabilities may
also divert resources and management attention away from product development.
In
the event we are unable to develop an effective marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates
in the United States or elsewhere in an effective manner, which could limit our ability to generate product revenues and materially harm
our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize
our product candidates include:
●
the inability to recruit, train,
manage, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;
●
the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to
physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product candidates;
17
●
our inability to effectively oversee
a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team;
●
the costs associated with training sales and marketing
personnel on legal and regulatory compliance matters and monitoring their actions;
●
an inability to secure adequate coverage and reimbursement
by government and private health plans;
●
the clinical indications for which the products are
approved and the claims that we may make for the products;
●
limitations or warnings, including distribution or
use restrictions, contained in the products’ approved labeling;
●
any distribution and use restrictions imposed by the
FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or to which we agree as part of a mandatory REMS or voluntary risk management plan;
●
third-party intellectual property rights that another
may allege are violated by our product candidates;
●
liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail
to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements;
●
the lack of complementary products to be offered by
sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and
●
unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating
an independent sales and marketing organization or engaging a contract sales organization.
As
we continue to evolve from a company primarily involved in research and development to a company also expected to be involved in commercialization,
we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.
We
anticipate that, as our operations expand and, assuming that our development, testing, studies and trials are successful, we will need
to expand our internal manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities. Managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities
on members of our management team and will be time consuming and costly. We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively;
manage our clinical trials effectively; hire, train and integrate additional management, development, administrative and sales and marketing
personnel; and improve managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative
and operational infrastructure.
Our
product candidates are based on a novel approach to the treatment of cancer, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of
product candidate development.
There
can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs,
or that such development problems can be solved. Should we encounter development problems, including unfavorable preclinical or clinical
trial results, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to approve our product candidates, or may require additional information,
tests, or trials, which could significantly delay product development and significantly increase our development costs. Moreover, even
if we are able to provide the requested information or trials to the FDA, there would be no guarantee that the FDA would accept them
or approve our product candidates. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing
process, or developing or qualifying and validating product release assays, other testing and manufacturing methods, and our equipment
and facilities in a timely manner, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our product candidates
on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.
In
addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators
use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended
use and market of the potential products. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have limited experience with the approval
of oncolytic immunotherapies. Limited immunotherapies have received FDA approval to date. Any product candidates that are approved may
be subject to extensive post approval regulatory requirements, including requirements pertaining to manufacturing, distribution, and
promotion. We may need to devote significant time and resources to compliance with these requirements.
If
our product candidates do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales may be limited, and we
may never become profitable.
We
have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication. Even if our product candidates are approved by the appropriate regulatory
authorities for marketing and sale, they may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical
community. If any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval do not gain an adequate level of market acceptance, we could
be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability.
Additionally,
efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources
and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance,
we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability.
18
The
degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, some of which are out of our control,
including the following:
●
the efficacy of our product
candidates in combination with marketed checkpoint blockade drugs;
●
the commercial success of the checkpoint blockade
drugs with which our products are co-administered;
●
the prevalence and severity of adverse events
associated with our product candidates or those products with which they are co-administered;
●
the clinical indications for which the products
are approved and the approved claims that we may make for the products;
●
limitations or warnings contained in the product’s
FDA-approved labeling or those of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including potential limitations or warnings for our
product candidates that may be more restrictive than other competitive products;
●
changes in the standard of care for the targeted
indications for our product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following FDA approval
or approval by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, if obtained;
●
the relative convenience and ease of administration
of our product candidates by direct injection into tumors, a less common method for the administration of oncology therapies than
systemic administration, which may result in slower adoption of our therapies;
●
the relative convenience and ease of administration
of any products with which our product candidates are co-administered;
●
the cost of treatment compared with the economic
and clinical benefit of alternative treatments or therapies;
●
the availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement
by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare
and Medicaid;
●
the price concessions required by third party
payors to obtain coverage;
●
the extent and strength of our marketing and
distribution of our product candidates;
●
the safety, efficacy, and other potential
advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments already used or that may later be approved;
●
distribution and use restrictions imposed
by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities with respect to our product candidates or to which we agree as part of a
REMS or voluntary risk management plan;
●
the timing of market introduction of our product
candidates, as well as competitive products;
●
our ability to offer our product candidates
for sale at competitive prices;
●
the willingness of the target patient population
to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;
●
the extent and strength of our manufacturing
operations and our third-party manufacturer and supplier support;
●
the actions of companies that market any products
with which our product candidates are co-administered;
●
the approval of other new products;
●
adverse publicity about our product candidates
or any products with which they are co-administered, or favorable publicity about competitive products; and
●
potential product liability claims.
The
successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities
and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies.
Sales
of any approved drug candidate will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers such as
government insurance programs, including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations
and other health care related organizations, who are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. Accordingly,
coverage and reimbursement may be uncertain. Adoption of any drug by the medical community may be limited if third-party payers will
not offer adequate formulary coverage. Additionally, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved
drugs. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any drug and, in turn, the price that we will be able to
charge and/or the volume of our sales. We are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will
be applied by private or government payers. Any denial of private or government payer coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm
our business and reduce our revenue.
In
addition, both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation,
regulations, and policies affecting coverage and reimbursement rates, which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care.
Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product
candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA,
includes several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms, including limits on price
increases, inflation and non-compliance penalties, and subjecting an escalating number of drugs to annual maximum fair price negotiations
with CMS. We cannot be sure whether additional legislation related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such
changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future. There also may be
future changes unrelated to the IRA that result in reductions in potential coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates,
if approved and commercialized, and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on
our operations. Similarly, several states have established prescription drug affordability boards that set upper payment limits (maximum
prices that can be charged for specific drugs) for select high-cost drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional state legislation related
to price caps will be enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if
approved for commercial use, in the future.
19
If
future reimbursement for approved product candidates, if any, is substantially less than we project, or rebate and/or discount, or fees
and obligations associated with them are substantially greater than we expect, our future net revenue and profitability could be materially
diminished.
The
size of the potential market for our product candidates is difficult to estimate and, if any of our assumptions are inaccurate, the actual
markets for our product candidates may be smaller than our estimates.
The
potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate and will depend in large part on the drugs with which
our product candidates are co-administered and the success of competing therapies and therapeutic approaches. Our estimates of the potential
market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, which may include industry knowledge and publications, third-party research
reports, and surveys of clinics. Although we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise
of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain, and their reasonableness has not been assessed by an
independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller
than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.
Risks
Related to the Ownership of Our Securities
We
have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock which will dilute existing ownership positions when issued.
At
December 31, 2024, our authorized capital stock consists of 225 million shares of common stock, of which approximately 224.3 million
remain available for issuance, including shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding derivative securities. Our
management will continue to have broad discretion to issue shares of our common stock in a range of transactions, including capital-raising
transactions, mergers, acquisitions and other transactions, without obtaining stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required
under law or the rules of Nasdaq or any other trading market on which our common stock may be listed. If our management determines it
be appropriate to issue shares of our common stock from the large pool of authorized but unissued shares for any purpose in the future
and is not required to obtain stockholder approval, your ownership position would be diluted without your further ability to vote on
that transaction.
Our
common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.
Our
common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely
affect the market prices of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as
quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause
the market prices of our common stock and warrants to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically
enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and,
therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock and warrants will be stable or appreciate over time.
We
may need, but be unable, to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms, which could dilute our stockholders or impose burdensome
financial restrictions on our business.
We
have relied upon cash from financing activities, and, in the future, we hope to rely on revenues generated from operations to fund the
cash requirements of our activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate any significant cash from our
operating activities in the future. Future financing may not be available on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. Any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to the common stock will likely include financial and other
covenants that will restrict our financing and/or operational flexibility. Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations because we could lose our existing sources of
funding, and our ability to secure new sources of funding could be impaired.

ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY
We
acknowledge the increasing importance of cybersecurity in today’s digital and interconnected world. Cybersecurity threats pose
significant risks to the integrity of our systems and data, potentially impacting our business operations, financial condition and reputation.
As
a smaller reporting company, we currently do not have enhanced cybersecurity measures, a dedicated cybersecurity team or robust protocols
in place to manage cybersecurity risks. We have not yet conducted comprehensive risk assessments, established an incident response plan
or engaged with external cybersecurity consultants for assessments or services. We intend to invest more resources into improving our
assessment and response to cybersecurity risk in the future.
Given
our current stage of cybersecurity development, we have not experienced any significant cybersecurity incidents to date. However, we
recognize that the absence of a formalized cybersecurity framework may leave us vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches and other cybersecurity
incidents. Such events could potentially lead to unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, sensitive information, disrupt our business
operations, result in regulatory fines or litigation costs and negatively impact our reputation among customers and partners. In addition,
cybersecurity incidents could have material adverse effects on our business strategy, financial condition, and results of operations
(e.g., a significant breach could result in direct financial losses due to fraud, system downtime impacting revenue generation, increased
compliance costs or contractual liabilities with third-party vendors and customers).
We
are in the process of evaluating our cybersecurity needs and developing appropriate measures to enhance our cybersecurity posture. This
includes considering the engagement of external cybersecurity experts to advise on best practices, conducting vulnerability assessments
and developing an incident response strategy. Our goal is to establish a cybersecurity framework that is commensurate with our size,
complexity and the nature of our operations, thereby reducing our exposure to cybersecurity risks.
In
addition, the Board will oversee any cybersecurity risk management framework, and the Board’s governance committee will review
and approve any cybersecurity policies, strategies and risk management practices.
The
Board (or designated committee or officer) will receive periodic updates on cybersecurity risks, including emerging threats, mitigation
efforts and incident response activities. The updates will be provided at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to ensure cybersecurity
risks are appropriately managed and integrated into our broader risk oversight strategy.
Despite
our efforts to improve our cybersecurity measures, there can be no assurance that our initiatives will fully mitigate the risks posed
by cyber threats. The landscape of cybersecurity risks is constantly evolving, and we will continue to assess and update our cybersecurity
measures in response to emerging threats. We may consider cybersecurity insurance coverage in the future, which will cover damages from
a range of potential cyber security issues including but not limited to property damage, privacy liability, privacy regulatory defense,
cyber extortion and post breach remediation.
For
a discussion of potential cybersecurity risks affecting us, please refer to the “Risk Factors” section.

2. Properties
None.
The lease for our previous operating facilities at 2042 Corte Del Nogal, Carlsbad, California had been in the name of our subsidiary
Qualigen, Inc. We sold Qualigen, Inc. in 2023 and the Company has no responsibility for the lease going forward. The Company had also
utilized such facility (in addition to Qualigen, Inc.’s use), but now has removed from it. The Company is currently essentially
“virtual.”

3. Legal Proceedings
From
time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving
patents that arise in the ordinary course of business.
On
January 29, 2025, the Company was named as a defendant in an action brought by LifeSci Capital LLC (“LifeSci”) in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that the Company failed to pay $503,483 in connection with
offerings of the Company’s common stock that occurred during the tail period of the agreement, pursuant to an engagement under
which the Company retained LifeSci to serve as its placement agent and financial advisor.
On
March 17, 2025, the Company filed its answer, denying the material allegations in the complaint and asserting various affirmative defenses.
As of June 26, 2025, the matter is in the discovery phase.
The
Company disputes that any amount is owed to Lifesci and is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or in
other parts of this Annual Report. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information.
Unless otherwise indicated, all information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K gives effect to a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of our
common stock that became effective on November 5, 2024, and all references to shares of common stock outstanding and per share amounts
give effect to the reverse stock split.
Overview
We
are an early-clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancer. Our business now consists
of one early-clinical-stage therapeutic program (QN-302), one preclinical therapeutic program (Pan-RAS), and a co-development agreement
with Marizyme, Inc (“Marizyme”).
Our
lead program, QN-302, is an investigational small molecule G-quadruplexes (G4)-selective transcription inhibitor with strong binding
affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells (such as pancreatic cancer). Such binding could, by stabilizing the G4s against DNA “unwinding,”
help inhibit cancer cell proliferation.
Our
Pan-RAS program, which is currently at the preclinical stage, consists of a family of RAS oncogene protein-protein interaction inhibitor
small molecules believed to inhibit or block mutated RAS genes’ proteins from binding to their effector proteins thereby leaving
the proteins from the mutated RAS unable to cause further harm. In theory, such mechanism of action may be effective in the treatment
of about one quarter of all cancers, including certain forms of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. The investigational compounds
within our Pan-RAS portfolio are designed to suppress the interaction of endogenous RAS with c-RAF, upstream of the KRAS, HRAS and NRAS
effector pathways.
Recent
Developments
On
April 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Co-Development Agreement (the “Co-Development Agreement”) with Marizyme. Under
the Co-Development Agreement (as amended), we agreed to pay Marizyme a Funding Payment of up to $1,750,000 and an Exclusivity Fee of
$200,000. The Exclusivity Fee of $200,000 and a Funding Payment of $500,000 was paid to Marizyme on April 12, 2024. The Exclusivity Fee
entitled us to an exclusivity period until May 31, 2024 for purposes of proposing and outlining a broader strategic relationship with
Marizyme with regard to Marizyme’s DuraGraft business. The Funding Payment is designed to provide financial support for commercialization
of Marizyme’s DuraGraft™ vascular conduit solution, which is indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage of the saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery. In return for the Funding Payment, we will receive quarterly a 33% payment in the nature of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined
with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of DuraGraft, capped at double the amount of the Funding Payment cash provided.
No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue until after DuraGraft has been launched in the United States and a cumulative
total of $500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made in the United States.
In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company advanced a total of $2,257,400 to Marizyme, against which Marizyme had
previously delivered demand promissory notes to the Company of like principal amounts (the “Marizyme Notes”). The Marizyme
Notes bear interest the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of the outstanding principal or
interest of the Marizyme Notes at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
On
November 5, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-50, reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse
Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split reduced our shares of outstanding common stock, stock options, and warrants to purchase
shares of our common stock. Fractional shares of common stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded
down to the nearest whole share and cash in lieu of fractional shares was paid to stockholders. All share and per share data for all
periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The number
of authorized shares of common stock and the par value per share remains unchanged.
We
do not expect to be profitable before products from our therapeutics pipeline are commercialized. To experience losses while therapeutic
products are still under development is, of course, typical for biotechnology companies. Given our financial situation, the company slowed
the development of the aforementioned therapeutic products beginning in the second quarter 2024. We have also implemented dramatic expense
controls in an effort to stem the rate of losses. Management and the board are strategically reviewing plans on how to best advance our
therapeutics pipeline, and will ramp up development when properly funded through either the capital markets or strategic partnerships.
23
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
consolidated financial statements historically have not separated our diagnostics-related activities from our therapeutics-related activities.
All of our historically reported revenue was diagnostics-related. Before the third quarter of 2023, our reported expenses represented
the total of our diagnostics-related and therapeutics-related expenses. In this Annual Report, all diagnostics-related revenues and expenses
have been reclassified to discontinued operations (See Note 6 - Discontinued Operations).
This
discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated
financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the determination of
the allowance for credit losses, fair value of derivative financial instruments and warrant liabilities, and stock-based
compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in “Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid
you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations:
●
Research and Development
●
Discontinued Operations
●
Reverse Stock Splits
●
Derivative Financial Instruments and Warrant Liabilities
●
Stock-Based Compensation
●
Income Taxes
Warrant
Liabilities
From
time to time the Company has issued certain warrants with terms that give rise to warrant liabilities (see Note 8 – Warrant Liabilities).
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) require us to recognize the fair value
of these warrants as warrant liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and to reflect period-to-period changes in the fair value
of the warrant liabilities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated fair value of these warrant liabilities was approximately
$0.3 million, and $0.1 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were liability classified warrants outstanding for
68,712 shares with a weighted average price of $2.00 (of which 52,693 were exercisable with a weighted average price of $0.23) at December
31, 2024 and liability classified warrants outstanding for 9,113 shares (of which all were exercisable) with a weighted average price
of $36.50 at December 31, 2023.
Because
the fair value of the above liability classified warrants will be determined each quarter on a “mark-to-market” basis, significant
variability in our future quarterly and annual Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets could occur based
on changes in our public market common stock price. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, a quarter-to-quarter increase in our stock price would result
in an increase in the fair value of the warrant liabilities and a quarter-to-quarter decrease in our stock price would result in a decrease
in the fair value of warrant liabilities.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued liability classified warrants for 52,474 shares, at a weighted average price of
$8.64, reclassified warrants for 71,026 shares with a weighted average price of $2.14 from equity to liabilities, and warrants for 38,315
shares with a weighted average price of $6.50 from liabilities to equity. Liability classified warrants for 25,586 shares expired with
a weighted average price of $13.00. No liability classified warrants were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2024.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued liability classified warrants for 9,113 shares, at a weighted average price of
$36.50, reclassified warrants for 50,000 shares with a weighted average price of $82.50 from liabilities to equity. Liability
classified warrants for 21,952 shares with a weighted average price of $66.00 expired, and liability classified warrants for 5,040
shares with a weighted average price of $66.00 were forfeited. No liability classified warrants were exercised during the year ended
December 31, 2023.
Short-Term
Notes Receivable
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company advanced to Marizyme, Inc., $2,257,400, against which Marizyme delivered demand promissory
notes to the Company of like principal amounts (the “Marizyme Notes”). As of December 31, 2024, accrued interest related
to the Marizyme Notes was $113,292 and interest income of this amount was recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of
operations. As of December 31, 2023 there were no amounts due to the Company under the Marizyme Notes.
The
Marizyme Notes bear at interest the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of the outstanding
principal or interest at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
Under
ASC 326-20, known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, the Company was required to estimate credit losses
expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The Company is unable to use its historical data to estimate losses as it has no relevant loss history to
date. To determine the estimate of expected credit losses, the Company used a probability-weighted approach that incorporates multiple
settlement scenarios, including recovery of amounts due upon an acquisition of the debtor, and recovery in different liquidation scenarios,
and determines the expected recoverable amount of the loan in each scenario. This model requires management to make certain assumptions
including the likelihood of each outcome, the estimated value of the debtor’s assets, and the Company’s expected claim and
recovery rate on the debtor’s assets in the event of an insolvency or a liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2024, the estimate
for expected credit losses on the Marizyme Notes is $360,000. Given the inherently uncertain nature of the debtor’s financial condition
and future outcomes, actual credit losses may differ materially from this estimate. The Company will continue to monitor relevant events
and conditions and update its assumptions and allowance as necessary.

Expenses
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses decreased from $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $4.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $0.9 million decrease in
payroll related expenses due to a reduction in force, and a $0.3 million decrease in insurance expenses, offset by an increase of $0.1 million in professional fees.
Research
and Development Costs
Research
and development expenses decreased from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $1.2 million for year ended December 31,
2024. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in preclinical, clinical research, and licensing costs for QN-302, a
$1.0 million decrease in preclinical research, and licensing costs for Pan-RAS, a $0.6 million decrease in payroll related expenses due
to a reduction in force, a $0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.1 million decrease in professional fees,
offset by a $0.7 increase in expenses related to the Marizyme Co-Development Agreement.
Credit
Loss Expense - Short Term Notes Receivable
There was a $0.4 million loss in the current year due to a charge for the Company’s estimate for expected credit
losses on the Marizyme Notes Receivable during the year ended December 31, 2024. There were no credit losses during the year ended December
31, 2023.
Other
Expense (Income), Net
Gain
on Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 we experienced a $0.4 million gain in other income due to the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities
described above. The estimated fair value of warrant liabilities increased to $0.3 million as of December 31, 2024 from $0.1 million
as of December 31, 2023 due to the issuance of new liability classified warrants with an initial fair value of $0.6 million, the reclassification
at fair value of equity classified warrants to warrant liabilities of $0.3 million, offset by the reclassification at fair value to equity
of liability classified warrants of $0.2 million, and the $0.4 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities due
to an associated decrease in the market price of our common stock and the expiration of liability classified warrants during the year.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023 we experienced a $2.0 million gain in other income because of the change in fair value of the warrant
liabilities. The estimated fair value of warrant liabilities decreased to $0.1 million as of December 31, 2023 from $3.6 million as of
December 31, 2022 due to a reduction in fair value of the warrant liabilities resulting from an associated decrease in the market price
of our common stock, and the reclassification at fair value of a liability classified warrant to equity of $1.6 million.
Typically,
a decline in our stock price would result in a decline in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a gain, while an increase
in our stock price would result in an increase in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a loss. Because the fair value
of the warrant liabilities will be determined each quarter on a “mark-to-market” basis, this item is likely to continue to
result in variability in our future quarterly Consolidated Statements of Operations based on unpredictable changes in our public market
common stock price and the number of liability classified warrants outstanding at the end of each quarter.
Gain
on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a gain of approximately $0.2 million on change in fair value of derivative liabilities
due to the issuance and subsequent extinguishment of the 2024 Alpha Debenture and 2024 Chen Debenture during the year. Derivative liabilities
at December 31, 2023 had no fair value.
Interest
Income
There
was $0.1 million in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to no interest income during the year ended December
31, 2023. The increase was due to interest accrued on the Marizyme Notes. There were no Marizyme notes outstanding during the year ended
December 31, 2023.
Interest
Expense, Net
There
was $0.9 million in net interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net interest expense of $1.5 million during
the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to lower outstanding balances on convertible debt during the current year compared
to the prior year.
Loss
on Issuance of Convertible Debt
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 we experienced a loss of approximately $358,000 due to the issuance of new convertible debt. There
was no loss on issuance of convertible debt during the year ended December 31, 2023.
26
(Gain)
Loss on Voluntary Conversion of Convertible Debt into Common Stock
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a gain of approximately $56,000 on the voluntary conversion of convertible debt into
common stock, due to the issuance of 58,378 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $674,000 upon partial voluntary
conversion of the 2022 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of $13.00, resulting in a gain of approximately $85,000, offset
by a loss of approximately $29,000 from the issuance of 7,842 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $61,000 upon
Alpha’s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of $6.50.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023 we issued 16,835 shares of common stock upon Alpha’s partial voluntary conversion of the 2022
Debenture at $66.00 per share for a total of $1,111,078 principal converted. Upon conversion, we recognized a loss on voluntary conversion
of convertible debt of approximately $1.1 million.
Loss
on Debt Extinguishment
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $57,000. In connection with the closing
of the Company’s private placement transaction and issuance of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, we used approximately $531,000 of the
proceeds to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the 2024 Alpha Debenture, in full settlement of the obligation, resulting
in a debt extinguishment loss of approximately $68,000. This loss was offset by a debt extinguishment gain of approximately $13,000 from
the issuance of 1,154 shares of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock, in full settlement of the obligation of $1,154,000 in outstanding
principal and interest on the 2024 Chen Debenture.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 6,193 shares of common stock in lieu of cash for the October and December 2023 monthly redemptions,
for a total of $220,000 principal redeemed, pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average share price of $35.52.
Upon redemption in shares, we recognized a loss on partial debt extinguishment of $34,315. The modification of the 2022 Debenture during
the year ended December 31, 2023 met the criteria to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment in the amount of $591,338. Accordingly,
we recognized an additional loss on partial debt extinguishment of that amount.
Loss
on Monthly Redemptions of Convertible Debt into Common Stock
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 45,496 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $903,000, in lieu of cash
for monthly redemptions of $660,000 principal and approximately $34,000 accrued interest redeemed, pursuant to the terms of the 2022
Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of $14.51. Upon redemption in shares, we recognized a loss on monthly redemptions of
convertible debt into common stock of approximately $209,000.
Gain
on Settlements of Accounts Payable
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, we settled $395,000 of our outstanding accounts payable for a gain of approximately $348,000. There
were no such settlements during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Loss
on Fixed Asset Disposal
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 there was no loss on fixed asset disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a $21,747
loss on fixed asset disposal due to disposal of research and development equipment previously used for QN-165.
Other
Income, Net
Other
income, net was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Discontinued
Operations
There
was no loss from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared approximately $0.7 million during the year
ended December 31, 2023, which consisted of approximately $0.2 million from our former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary and approximately $0.5
million from NanoSynex.
The
Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.1 million on disposal of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024,
which was generated due to the early settlement of an escrow account from the sale of Qualigen, Inc. During the year ended December 31,
2023, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.6 million on disposal of discontinued operations, consisting of a loss of approximately
$4.5 million from the deconsolidation of NanoSynex, offset by a gain of approximately $3.9 million from the sale of our former Qualigen,
Inc. subsidiary.
27
Liquidity
and Going Concern
Our
financial position is weak. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.2 million in cash and net accounts payable of over $1.6
million. We are in arrears on accounts payable to important partners. We have incurred recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated
deficit of $123.1 million at December 31, 2024. We expect to continue to incur losses subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date
of December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we used cash of $6.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively, in
operations. We sold our Qualigen, Inc. FastPack® diagnostics products business in 2023.
Our current liabilities at December 31, 2024 include approximately $1.6
million of accounts payable, $170,000 of accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $269,000
in warrant liabilities.
We
currently expect our cash balances to fund operations only into the third quarter of 2025. We expect to continue to have net
losses and negative cash flow from operations, which will challenge our liquidity. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our
ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the date that the financial statements in this Annual Report
were issued.
Historically,
our principal sources of cash have, in addition to previous revenue from product sales and license revenues from the FastPack product
of line of Qualigen, Inc. (which we divested in July 2023), included proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity and proceeds
from warrant exercises and the issuance of debt. There can be no assurance that further financing can be obtained on favorable terms,
or at all. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs,
product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, and we could be unable to continue operations.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024 we raised approximately $8.0 million in new equity consisting of $4.6 million from the sale of Preferred
Series A-2 Preferred Stock, $3.0 million from the sale of common stock and prefunded warrants in a public offering, and $0.4 million
from warrant exercises. We also raised $1.5 million in new convertible debt, and $2.0 million in short-term debt, of which $1.1 million
in convertible debt and accrued interest was exchanged for Preferred Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and $0.5 million was repaid in cash. The $2.0 million in short-term
debt was also repaid in cash during the year. These equity and debt capital raises resulted in approximately $9.0 million in cash provided
by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to no new equity or debt issued during the year ended December
31, 2023.
To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our
common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting
our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise
additional funds through third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic
alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue
streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Delisting
of our common stock from Nasdaq would have a serious negative effect on any future financing efforts. On April 24, 2025, the Company
received a notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the Company was delinquent in filing its 2024 Form 10-K, the Company
no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c), which requires companies with securities listed on Nasdaq to timely file all required
periodic reports with the SEC. Therefore, in line with the Panel Monitor’s decision, the Company’s securities will be delisted
from Nasdaq. If the Company did not request an appeal of this decision by May 1, 2025, trading of the Company’s common stock would
have been suspended at the start of business on May 5, 2025. The Company appealed this decision to Nasdaq on May 1, 2025 and has taken
the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there
can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company further extensions for other late filings, or that the Company will ultimately
regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern, and therefore, be required to liquidate
its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts that may differ from those reflected
in the accompanying financial statements.
28
Contractual
Obligations and Commitments
We
have no material contractual obligations that are not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes
to the financial statements.
License
and Sponsored Research Agreements
We
have obligations under various license agreements to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement
of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing for product approval with
the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product launch or product sales) or on
the sublicense of our rights to another party. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet because the achievement and
timing of these events is not determinable. Certain milestones are in advance of receipt of revenue from the sale of products and, therefore,
we may require additional debt or equity capital to make such payments.
We
have multiple license and sponsored research agreements with University of Louisville Research Foundation ULRF. Under these
agreements, we have taken over development, regulatory approval and commercialization of various drug compounds from ULRF and are
responsible for maintenance of the related intellectual property portfolio. Under the terms of these agreements, we are required to
make patent maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered
by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $5
million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the
low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the
low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, but we will be required to pay ULRF a
percentage of any sublicense income.
On
January 13, 2022, we entered into a License Agreement with UCL Business Limited to obtain an exclusive worldwide in-license of a genomic
quadruplex (G4)-selective transcription inhibitor drug development program which had been developed at University College London, including
lead and back-up compounds, preclinical data and a patent estate. (UCL Business Limited is the commercialization company for University
College London.) We are further developing the program’s lead compound under the name QN-302. The License Agreement requires (if
and when applicable) tiered royalty payments in the low to mid-single digits, clinical/regulatory/sales milestone payments, and sharing
of a percentage of any non-royalty sublicensing consideration paid to the Company. In November 2023, we became obligated to pay $100,000
to UCL Business Limited upon the first patient dosing of QN-302, which was paid in January 2024.
Marizyme
On
April 11, 2024, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme, Inc. (“Marizyme”). Under the Co-Development Agreement
(as amended on August 6, 2024), we agreed to pay Marizyme a Funding Payment of up to $1,750,000 and an Exclusivity Fee of $200,000. The
Exclusivity Fee of $200,000 and a Funding Payment of $500,000 was paid to Marizyme on April 12, 2024. The Exclusivity Fee entitled us
to an exclusivity period until May 31, 2024 for purposes of proposing and outlining a broader strategic relationship with Marizyme with
regard to Marizyme’s DuraGraft business. The Funding Payment is designed to provide financial support for commercialization of
Marizyme’s DuraGraft™ vascular conduit solution, which is indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage of the saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery. In return for the Funding Payment we will receive quarterly a 33% payment in the nature of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined
with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of DuraGraft, capped at double the amount of the Funding Payment cash provided.
No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue until after DuraGraft has been launched in the United States and a cumulative
total of $500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made in the United States.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company advanced to Marizyme $2,257,400, against which Marizyme delivered demand promissory notes
to the Company of like principal amounts (the “Marizyme Notes”). As of December 31, 2024, accrued interest related to the
Marizyme Notes was $113,292 and interest income of this amount was recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2024, the estimate for expected credit losses on the
Marizyme Notes is $200,000, which was recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2024, the estimate for expected credit losses on the Marizyme Notes is $360,000, which was recognized
in the consolidated statement of operations.
The
Marizyme Notes bear interest the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of the outstanding principal
or interest of the Marizyme Notes at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
From January through June 2025, an additional $1,518,500 was advanced to
Marizyme against which Marizyme delivered additional demand promissory notes.
29
Other
Service Agreements
We
enter into contracts in the normal course of business, including with clinical sites, contract research organizations, and other professional
service providers for the conduct of clinical trials, contract manufacturers for the production of our product candidates, contract research
service providers for preclinical research studies, professional consultants for expert advice and vendors for the sourcing of clinical
and laboratory supplies and materials. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Qualigen
Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash
flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going
Concern Uncertainty
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2024 and continuing net losses
and negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matter
The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Current
Expected Credit Losses (CECL)
Critical
Audit Matter Description
As
described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company establishes a reserve for the short-term notes receivable that
reflects its estimate of current expected credit losses (CECL). The Company is unable to use its historical data to estimate losses as
it has no relevant loss history to date. To determine the estimate of current expected credit losses, the Company used a probability-weighted
approach that incorporates multiple settlement scenarios, including recovering of amounts due upon acquisition of the debtor, and recovery
in liquidation scenario. The model requires management to make certain assumptions including the likelihood of each outcome. As of December
31, 2024, the estimate for expected credit losses on the debtor is approximately $360,000.
Auditing
the Company’s CECL reserve is challenging due to the significant assumptions and judgment used by management involve a high degree
of auditor judgment.
How
We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●Obtaining
and understanding the promissory note agreement.
●Obtaining
and reviewing management’s prepared accounting memo.
●Evaluating
management’s assumptions used in the probability-weighted approach.
●Obtaining
available market data to corroborate management’s probability assumptions.

QUALIGEN
THERAPEUTICS, INC.
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31, 2024
NOTE
1 — ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Organization
Ritter
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company’s predecessor) was formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under
the name Ritter Natural Sciences, LLC. In September 2008, this company converted into a Delaware corporation under the name Ritter Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. On May 22, 2020, upon completing a “reverse recapitalization” transaction with Qualigen, Inc., Ritter Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. was renamed Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”). Qualisys Diagnostics, Inc. was formed as a Minnesota corporation
in 1996, reincorporated to become a Delaware corporation in 1999, and then changed its name to Qualigen, Inc. in 2000. Qualigen, Inc.
was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 20, 2023, the Company sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
of Qualigen, Inc. to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (“Chembio”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biosynex, S.A. (“Biosynex”).
Following the consummation of this transaction, Qualigen, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chembio (see Note 6 – Discontinued
Operations).
On
May 26, 2022, the Company acquired 2,232,861 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of NanoSynex, Ltd. (“NanoSynex”) from Alpha
Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”), a related party, in exchange for 7,000 reverse split adjusted shares of the Company’s common
stock and a prefunded warrant to purchase 6,629 reverse split adjusted shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price
of $0.001 per share. These warrants were subsequently exercised on September 13, 2022. Concurrently with this transaction, the Company
also entered into a Master Funding Agreement for the Operational and Technology Funding of NanoSynex Ltd., dated May 26, 2022, with NanoSynex
(the “NanoSynex Funding Agreement”), to, among other things, provide for the further funding of NanoSynex, and purchased
381,786 shares of Series B preferred stock from NanoSynex for a total purchase price of $600,000. The transactions resulted in the Company
acquiring a 52.8% interest in NanoSynex (the “NanoSynex Acquisition”). NanoSynex is a nanotechnology diagnostics company
domiciled in Israel. On July 20, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment and Settlement Agreement with NanoSynex (the “NanoSynex
Amendment”), which amended the NanoSynex Funding Agreement, to, among other things, eliminate most of the Company obligation for
the further funding of NanoSynex. Pursuant to the terms of the NanoSynex Amendment, the Company lost its controlling interest in NanoSynex
(see Note 6 – Discontinued Operations).
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), Regulation S-X and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”).
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its former wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance
is meant to refer to U.S. GAAP. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment . See the section
Segment Reporting below for more information. In general, the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.
For NanoSynex, the functional currency was the local currency, New Israeli Shekels (NIS). As such, assets and liabilities for NanoSynex
were translated into U.S. dollars with the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss within the Company’s consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit).
As
of July 20, 2023, NanoSynex was deconsolidated from these financial statements as the transactions contemplated by the NanoSynex Amendment
resulted in a loss of control of a subsidiary that constitutes a business under ASC 810. The retained investment in NanoSynex is accounted
for prospectively as an equity method investment. See Note 6 – Discontinued Operations for further information.
Discontinued
Operations
On
July 20, 2023, the Company completed the sale of Qualigen, Inc. to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. The sale of Qualigen Inc. constituted a
significant disposition and as such, the Company concluded that the disposition of ownership in Qualigen, Inc. represented a strategic
shift that had a major effect on its operations and financial results. Therefore, Qualigen, Inc. is classified as discontinued operations
for all periods presented herein.
38
On
July 20, 2023, the Company entered into the NanoSynex Amendment, which amended the Master Funding Agreement for the Operational and Technology
Funding of NanoSynex Ltd., dated May 26, 2022, by and between the Company and NanoSynex (the “NanoSynex Funding Agreement”),
a former majority owned subsidiary of the Company, to, among other things, forfeit 281,000 Series B Preferred Shares of NanoSynex held
by the Company, resulting in the deconsolidation of NanoSynex. The disposition represents a strategic shift that will have a material
effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the business of NanoSynex is classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented herein.
See
Note 6 - Discontinued Operations for further information.
Equity
Method Investments
Following
deconsolidation of NanoSynex on July 20, 2023, the Company accounts for its retained investment under the equity method of accounting
as it retained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Under the equity
method, the Company recognizes its proportionate share earnings or losses each reporting period with an adjustment to the carrying value
of the investment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the retained investment was zero, and therefore the Company
has suspended application of the equity method as the Company is not liable for the obligations of the investee nor otherwise committed
to provide financial support. Future equity method earnings, if any, will not be recognized until the amount exceeds the unrecognized
net losses in prior periods. See Note 6 – Discontinued Operations for further information.
Accounting
Estimates
Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues
and expenses. The most significant estimates relate to the estimated fair value of convertible notes, warrant liabilities, determination
of the allowance for credit losses, and stock-based compensation. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were used.
Reverse
Stock Splits
On
November 23, 2022, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “2022 Reverse
Stock Split”). The 2022 Reverse Stock Split reduced the Company’s shares of outstanding common stock, stock options, and
warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Fractional shares of common stock that would have otherwise resulted from the 2022 Reverse
Stock Split were rounded down to the nearest whole share and cash in lieu of fractional shares was paid to stockholders.
On
November 20, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “2024 Reverse
Stock Split”). The 2024 Reverse Stock Split reduced the Company’s shares of outstanding common stock, stock options, and
warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Fractional shares of common stock that would have otherwise resulted from the 2024 Reverse
Stock Split were rounded down to the nearest whole share and cash in lieu of fractional shares was paid to stockholders.
All
share and per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and the related disclosures have been adjusted
retrospectively to reflect both reverse stock splits. The number of authorized shares of common stock and the par value per share remains
unchanged.
Cash
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of 90 days or less and money market funds to be cash
equivalents.
The
Company maintains the majority of its cash in accounts at banking institutions in the U.S. that are of high quality. Cash held in these
accounts often exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, the
Company could lose all or a portion of amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had
not experienced losses on these accounts, and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risk on such accounts.
39
Segment
Reporting
The Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, as of January 1, 2024. See the section Recent Accounting
Pronouncements below for more information. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete
financial information is regularly reviewed for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in making decisions
regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and managed its business as one
segment operating primarily within the United States (and in Israel prior to the NanoSynex deconsolidation). The Company is an early stage
clinical therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancer. The Company’s operations are organized
and reported as a single reportable segment, which includes all activities related to the discovery, development, and commercialization
of its products. The Company’s CODM, its chief executive officer, reviews operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the
operations as a single operating segment. The accounting policies of the Company’s single operating and reportable segment are the
same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated
balance sheets as total assets. The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on consolidated net income (loss) that also
is reported on the consolidated statements of operations as net loss, and consolidated cash used in operations. The significant expenses
regularly reviewed by the CODM are consistent with those reported on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations, and expenses
are not regularly provided to or reviewed on a more disaggregated basis for purposes of assessing segment performance and deciding how
to allocate resources.
Research
and Development
Except
for acquired in process research and development (IPR&D), the Company expenses research and development costs as incurred including
therapeutics license costs.
Patent
Costs
The
Company expenses all costs as incurred in connection with patent applications (including direct application fees, and the legal and consulting
expenses related to making such applications) and such costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Derivative
Financial Instruments and Warrant Liabilities
The
Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates
all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain
features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative
instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Depending on the features of the derivative financial instrument,
the Company uses either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte-Carlo simulation to value the derivative instruments at inception
and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as
liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period (See Note 8 – Warrant Liabilities and Note 9 –
Convertible Debt).
40
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company determines the fair value measurements of applicable assets and liabilities based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy established
by accounting guidance and prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The Company discloses and recognizes the fair value of
its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements).
The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:
●Level
1 - Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date;
●Level
2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liability either
directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active;
and
●Level
3 - Inputs that are unobservable.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Cash, prepaid expenses, and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which
management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Short-term notes receivable are valued
subject to a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model (see Note 4 - Short-Term Notes Receivable).
Comprehensive
Loss
Comprehensive
loss consists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments related to the discontinued operations of NanoSynex. Comprehensive
gains (losses) have been reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a separate component in the statements
of stockholders’ equity (deficit) for all periods presented.
Stock-Based
Compensation
Stock-based
compensation cost for equity awards granted to employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair
value of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is recognized as an expense, under the straight-line method, over
the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). If the Company determines that other methods are more
reasonable, or other methods for calculating these assumptions are prescribed by regulators, the fair value calculated for the Company’s
stock options could change significantly. Higher volatility, lower risk-free interest rates, and longer expected lives would result in
an increase to stock-based compensation expense to employees and non-employees determined at the date of grant.
Income
Taxes
Deferred
income taxes are recognized for temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax
reporting that arise due to net operating loss carry forwards, research and development credit carry forwards and from using
different methods and periods to calculate depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued vacation,
research and development expenses, and state taxes. A provision has been made for income taxes due on taxable income and for the
deferred taxes on the temporary differences. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on the date of enactment. Realization of the deferred income tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income
in future years. See Note 15 - Income Taxes for further information.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
functional currency for the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the discontinued operations of NanoSynex was the
New Israeli Shekel (NIS). The financial statements of NanoSynex were translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at each
period end for assets and liabilities; using exchange rates in effect during the period for results of operations; and using historical
exchange rates for certain equity accounts. The adjustment resulting from translating the financial statements of NanoSynex was reflected
as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 6 – Discontinued Operations).
41
Accounting
Standards Updates - Recently Adopted
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment
Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which is intended to improve reportable
segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Effective January 1, 2024,
the Company adopted the new standard on a retrospective basis for annual periods, and interim periods beginning for the first quarter
of 2025. The Company does not believe the impact of the new guidance and related codification improvements had a material impact to its
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Accounting
Standards Updates - Not Yet Adopted
In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires more detailed income
tax disclosures. The guidance requires entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as
well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis,
with the option to apply them retrospectively. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early

Global
Economic Conditions
Ongoing
Wars in Ukraine and Israel
In
February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. While the Company has no direct exposure in Russia and Ukraine, the Company continues to monitor
any broader impact to the global economy, including with respect to inflation, supply chains and fuel prices. The full impact of the
conflict on the Company’s business and financial results remains uncertain and will depend on the severity and duration of the
conflict and its impact on regional and global economic conditions.
In
October 2023, Hamas conducted terrorist attacks in Israel resulting in ongoing war. There continue to be hostilities between Israel and
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, both of which have resulted in rockets being fired into Israel, causing casualties
and disruption of economic activities. In early 2023, there were a number of changes proposed to the political system in Israel by the
current government which, if implemented as planned, could lead to large-scale protests and additional uncertainty, negatively impacting
the operating environment in Israel. Populist uprisings in various countries in the Middle East over the last few years have also affected
the political stability of those countries and have led to a decline in the regional security situation. Such instability may also lead
to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between Israel and these countries. Any armed conflicts, terrorist
activities or political instability involving Israel or other countries in the region could adversely affect the Company’s minority
interest in NanoSynex, its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects (see Note 6 – Discontinued Operations).
Inflation
and Global Economic Conditions
Beginning
in 2022 and continuing into the current fiscal year, global commodity and labor markets experienced significant inflationary pressures
attributable to government stimulus and recovery programs, government deficit spending and supply chain issues. The Company cannot provide
assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressure. In addition, the global
economy suffers from slowing growth and rising interest rates, and some economists believe that there may be a global recession in the
near future. If the global economy slows, the Company’s business may be adversely affected.
Impact
of COVID-19 Pandemic
The
COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on businesses globally and on the Company’s business as well. During the height of
the pandemic, sales of diagnostic products decreased significantly and the Company’s net loss increased significantly, as clinics
and small hospitals’ demand for Qualigen, Inc.’s FastPack™ diagnostic test kits was reduced sharply, largely due to
deferral of patients’ non-emergency visits to physician offices. In July 2023 the Company sold Qualigen, Inc., its wholly-owned
subsidiary, to Chembio (see Note 6 - Discontinued Operations).
42
NOTE
2 — LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $1.2 million in cash and an accumulated deficit of $123.1 million. For the years
ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company used cash of $6.3 million and $10.3 million, respectively, in operations.
The
Company’s cash balances as of the date that these financial statements were issued, without additional financing, are expected
to fund operations only into the third quarter of 2025. The Company expects to continue to have net losses and negative cash flow
from operations, which will challenge its liquidity. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern for the one-year period following the date that these financial statements were issued.
There
is no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis.
Historically,
the Company’s principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity and proceeds
from the issuance of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company raised approximately $1.5
million from the sale of Convertible Debentures (see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), and an additional $2.0
million from the sale of a nonconvertible 18% Senior Note, which was subsequently repaid in September 2024. The Company raised
additional net proceeds of approximately $3.1
million from the sale of common stock and prefunded warrants in a public offering, raised approximately $4.6
million from the sale of newly designated Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock in a private placement, and $0.4
million from warrant exercises. At the closing of the private placement, approximately $1.2
million in Convertible Debentures and accrued interest were exchanged for shares of Series A-2 Convertible Preferred stock, and the
remaining outstanding balance of $0.5
million in Convertible Debentures and accrued interest was repaid. From January to June 2025, we borrowed a total of $3,470,000
from eight investors as short-term borrowings, each due within six months after the date of borrowing. There can be no assurance
that further financing can be obtained on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could
be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization
efforts, which could adversely affect the Company’s business prospects.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, and therefore, be
required to liquidate its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts that may differ
from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company advanced to Marizyme, Inc., $2,257,400, against which Marizyme delivered demand promissory
notes to the Company of like principal amounts (the “Marizyme Notes”). As of December 31, 2024, accrued interest related
to the Marizyme Notes was $113,292 and interest income of this amount was recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of
operations and is included in short-term notes receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023 there were no amounts due to the Company under the Marizyme Notes.
The Marizyme Notes bear at interest the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of the
outstanding principal or interest at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
43
Under
ASC 326-20, known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, the Company was required to estimate credit losses
expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. The Company is unable to use its historical data to estimate losses as it has no relevant loss history to date.
To determine the estimate of expected credit losses, the Company used a probability-weighted approach that incorporates multiple settlement
scenarios, including recovery of amounts due upon an acquisition of the debtor, and recovery in different liquidation scenarios, and
determines the expected recoverable amount of the loan in each scenario. This model requires management to make certain assumptions including
the likelihood of each outcome, the estimated value of the debtor’s assets, and the Company’s expected claim and recovery
rate on the debtor’s assets in the event of an insolvency or a liquidation proceeding. As of December 31, 2024, the estimate for
expected credit losses on the Marizyme Notes is $360,000. Given the inherently uncertain nature of the debtor’s
financial condition and future outcomes, actual credit losses may differ materially from this estimate. The Company will continue to
monitor relevant events and conditions and update its assumptions and allowance as necessary.
The
Company is also party to a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme (see Note 12 - Research and License Agreements).

Amendment
and Settlement Agreement with NanoSynex Ltd.
On
July 20, 2023, the Company entered into and effectuated the NanoSynex Amendment, reducing its ownership from approximately 52.8% to approximately
49.97% of the voting equity of NanoSynex, and deconsolidation of the subsidiary. On November 22, 2023, the Company further agreed to
eliminate the Company’s obligations to lend additional funds to NanoSynex by surrendering shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
of NanoSynex in an amount that reduced the Company’s ownership in NanoSynex voting equity from approximately 49.97% to 39.90%.
On
the date of deconsolidation, the Company recognized its retained investment at fair value, which was determined to be de minimis based
on various economic, industry, and other factors. As a result, the Company has discontinued recognition of its proportionate share
of equity method losses following the date of initial recognition. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the retained
investment was zero. Future equity method earnings, if any, will not be recognized until the amount exceeds the unrecognized net losses
in prior periods.
There
were no assets and liabilities recognized related to NanoSynex as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.

NOTE
8 – WARRANT LIABILITIES
In
2004, the Company issued warrants to various investors and brokers for the purchase of Series C preferred stock in connection with a
private placement (the “Series C Warrants”). The Series C Warrants were subsequently extended and, upon closing of the reverse
recapitalization transaction with Ritter, exchanged for warrants to purchase common stock of the Company. The Series C Warrants were
determined to be liability-classified pursuant to the guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40, based on the inclusion of a leveraged ratchet
provision for subsequent dilutive issuances. As of December 31, 2022 there were 26,992 Series C Warrants outstanding with an exercise
price of $66.00 per share. On November 24, 2023, 21,952 Series C Warrants expired, and on December 5, 2023 the remaining Series C Warrants
were repriced from an exercise price of $66.00 per share to an exercise price of $36.50 per share, with 4,074 additional ratchet Series
C Warrants issued, resulting in 9,113 Series C Warrants outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2023.
On
February 27, 2024, these Series C Warrants were repriced again as a result of a down-round provision triggered by a Securities Purchase
Agreement with Alpha for the purchase of the February 2024 Debentures described below, from an exercise price of $36.50 per share to
an exercise price of $13.00 per share, with 16,473 additional ratchet Series C Warrants issued, resulting in 25,586 Series C Warrants,
which expired on June 26, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on change in fair value of warrant
liabilities of $54,600 for the Series C Warrants.
In
December 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of a convertible debenture to Alpha (see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), the Company
issued to Alpha a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Alpha Warrant”). The exercise
price of the Alpha Warrant was $82.50 (equal to 125% of the conversion price of the Debenture on the closing date). The Alpha Warrant
may be exercised by Alpha, in whole or in part, on or after June 22, 2023 and at any time before June 22, 2028, subject to certain terms
and conditions described in the Alpha Warrant. On December 5, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 with regard to a Securities
Purchase Agreement with Alpha. This Amendment eliminated certain adjustment provisions of the Warrant. The Company determined that the
event resulted in equity classification for the Alpha Warrant and, accordingly, the Company remeasured the fair value on that date and
reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants (see Note 13 – Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).
On
February 27, 2024, in connection with an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Alpha Debenture”) in the principal amount of
$550,000 issued to Alpha (see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), the Company issued a noncompensatory equity classified warrant to Alpha
(the “2024 Alpha Warrant”) to purchase 18,001 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $13.00 per share, which may
be exercised in whole or in part, at any time before February 27, 2029. On September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision
triggered by shares sold in a public offering, the above warrants were repriced from $13.00 per share exercise price to $6.50 per share
exercise price. As a result of a partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture on September 9, 2024, the Company no longer
had sufficient shares to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until shareholder approval was obtained, and a portion (2,314 warrant
shares with a fair value of $14,997) was reclassified to liabilities. Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024,
and as of that date, the Company determined that shareholder approval resulted in equity classification for the warrant and, accordingly,
the Company remeasured the warrant liability to fair value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants (see Note
13 – Stockholders Equity (Deficit)). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on change in fair value
of warrant liabilities of $3,072 for these warrants.
On
April 12, 2024 , in connection with an 8% Convertible Debenture in the principal amount of $1,100,000 issued to Yi Hua Chen (“Chen”)
(see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), the Company issued a liability classified warrant to Chen to purchase 36,001 shares of common
stock, exercisable until February 27, 2029. On September 6, 2024 , as a result of a down-round provision triggered by shares sold
in a public offering, the warrant was repriced from an exercise price of $13.00 per share to an exercise price of $6.50 per share. The
warrant was initially liability classified due to an insufficient number of authorized shares to settle the warrant prior to the receipt
of shareholder approval, which was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024. As of that date, the Company determined that shareholder
approval resulted in equity classification for the warrant and accordingly, the Company remeasured the warrant liability to fair value,
and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants (see Note 13 – Stockholders Equity (Deficit)). The fair value of
this warrant was $565,582 on the issuance date and $185,531 on the date of reclassification to equity. During the year ended December
31, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $380,051 for this warrant.
On
November 20, 2024, the Company closed its private placement transaction resulting in the issuance of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred
Stock (see Note 13 – Stockholders Equity (Deficit)). As a result of the issuance of a new class of voting securities, the Company
evaluated its equity classified warrants’ respective terms, and concluded that warrants for 68,712 common shares with a weighted
average exercise price of $2.00 and a fair value of $247,262 were required to be reclassified to liabilities as of November 20, 2024.
During the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company recorded a loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $21,913 for these
warrants.

There
were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between category levels for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The
value of the warrant liabilities was based on valuations received from an independent valuation firm determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation
and internally generated Black Scholes valuations. Due to the nominal exercise price of the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants and indefinite term,
the Company calculated an implied value of the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants based on the underlying common stock price on the valuation date,
less the exercise price. For volatility, the Company considers comparable public companies as a basis for its expected volatility to
calculate the fair value of common stock warrants and transitions to its own volatility as the Company develops sufficient appropriate
history as a public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected term
of the common stock warrant. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash
dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any significant changes in the inputs may result in significantly
higher or lower fair value measurements.

2022
Convertible Debenture (Related party)
On
December 22, 2022, the Company issued to Alpha an 8% Senior Convertible Debenture in the aggregate principal amount of $3,300,000 (the
“2022 Debenture”) for a purchase price of $3,000,000 pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated December
21, 2022 (the “2022 Securities Purchase Agreement”). The 2022 Debenture carried a maturity date of December 22, 2025 and
was convertible, at any time, at Alpha’s option, into shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Shares”),
at a price initially equal to $66.00 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2022 Debenture. On July 13, 2023, the Company
obtained stockholder approval, for purposes of complying with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), to allow for the issuance to Alpha of more
than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2022 Debenture, and the common
stock purchase warrant dated December 22, 2022 (the “2022 Warrant”) issued by us to Alpha.
Commencing
June 1, 2023, the Company was required to redeem $110,000 monthly, plus accrued and unpaid interest in cash, or, subject to the Equity
Conditions (as defined in the 2022 Debenture) having been satisfied or waived, in shares of our common stock, based on a conversion price
equal to the lesser of (i) the then-effective conversion price of the 2022 Debenture and (ii) 85% of the average of the VWAPs (as defined
in the 2022 Debenture) for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately before the applicable monthly redemption
date. The 2022 Debenture accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum beginning on December 1, 2023, and was payable on a monthly or
quarterly basis in cash or, subject to the Equity Conditions having been satisfied or waived, shares or a combination thereof at our
option.
49
In
December 2022, pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement, we entered into a registration rights agreement with
Alpha (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as
necessary, and to the extent permissible, to register under the Securities Act the resale of the remaining shares (underlying the 2022
Debenture and the 2022 Warrant) not otherwise registered under the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-266430).
We filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to the requirements of the Registration Rights Agreement on December 2022
(File Number 333-269088), which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 5, 2023. On September 1, 2023, we
filed a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form S-3 on Form S-1 (File No. 333-269088), which Post-Effective Amendment was declared effective
by the SEC on September 7, 2023. On May 1, 2024, we filed a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 to Form S-1 on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269088),
which Post-Effective Amendment was declared effective by the SEC on May 2, 2024.
The
Company evaluated the 2022 Debenture and the 2022 Warrant and determined that the 2022 Warrant is a freestanding financial instrument.
Initially, the 2022 Warrant is not considered indexed to the Company’s own stock, because the settlement amount would not equal
the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of the Company’s equity shares and a fixed strike price and all of the
adjustment features in Section 3(b) of the Alpha Warrant are not down round provisions, as defined in ASU 2017-11. Accordingly, the 2022
Warrant was classified as a liability and recognized at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
The
proceeds from the 2022 Debenture were allocated to the initial fair value of the 2022 Warrant, with the residual balance allocated to
the initial carrying value of the 2022 Debenture. The Company has not elected the fair value option for the 2022 Debenture. The 2022
Debenture was recognized as proceeds received after allocating the proceeds to the 2022 Warrant, and then allocating remaining proceeds
to a suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features (conversion option, contingent acceleration upon an Event of Default, and contingent
interest upon an Event of Default), with the resulting difference, if any, allocated to the loan host instrument. The suite of derivative
features was measured and initially determined to have no fair value.
On
December 5, 2023, the Company and Alpha executed Amendment No. 1 to the 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA Amendment”),
pursuant to which the Company and Alpha agreed to, among other things, reduce the Conversion Price of the 2022 Debenture from $66.00
per share to $36.50 per share and reduce the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant from $82.50 per share to $36.50 per share, in each case
subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the SPA Amendment revised certain provisions of the 2022 Warrant to (i) limit the circumstances
which would trigger a potential adjustment to the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant and (ii) clarify the treatment of the 2022 Warrant
upon a Fundamental Transaction. The purpose of these revisions was to remove the terms that caused the 2022 Warrant to be liability-classified
under U.S. GAAP. The Company performed an assessment and concluded that (i) all remaining adjustment features in the revised language
meet the FASB’s definition of a down-round feature, and (ii) the 2022 Warrant, as amended, met all of the additional requirements
for equity classification. Accordingly, as of December 5, 2023, the Company remeasured the 2022 Warrant to its fair value immediately
prior to the modification and recognized the change in fair value in earnings. The incremental fair value impact from the 2022 Warrant
modification of $0.09 million was included in the Company’s evaluation of the 2022 Debenture modification under ASC 470, discussed
further below. The Company then reclassified the 2022 Warrant liability to equity at its post-modification fair value of $1.6 million.
In
accordance with ASC 470-50, the Company determined that the modified terms of the 2022 Debenture were substantially different when compared
to the original terms that existed prior to the SPA Amendment, and thus the event was required to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment.
Accordingly, the Company derecognized the net carrying value of the original Debenture, and recorded the new debt instrument at its fair
value of $1.4 million, and recorded a $0.6 million loss on debt extinguishment. The difference between the remaining 2022 Debenture principal
and its fair value on December 5, 2023 was recorded as a debt discount, which was amortized to interest expense over the expected term
of the Debenture using the effective interest method, in accordance with ASC 835-30.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued a total of (i) 16,834 shares of our common stock upon Alpha’s partial voluntary
conversion of the 2022 Debenture at a conversion price of $66.00 per share, extinguishing a total of $1,111,078 principal, and (ii) 6,193
shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments totaling $220,000 due on the 2022 Debenture at a weighted
average conversion price of $35.52 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid monthly redemption payments of
$550,000 in cash, and recorded accrued interest of approximately $1.5 million in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features was $0.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an extinguishment loss on voluntary conversions of the 2022 Debenture of approximately
$1.1
million, and a loss on debt extinguishment totaling $0.6
million upon monthly redemptions of the 2022 Debenture and the December 2023 modification, which are presented in the expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations.
On
February 27, 2024, in connection with the issuance of an additional warrant to Alpha with an exercise price of $13.00 per share, and
pursuant to certain antidilution provisions in the 2022 Debenture, the Conversion Price of the 2022 Debenture was reduced from $36.50
per share to $13.00 per share.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued a total of 45,496 shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption
payments totaling $660,000 due on the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average conversion price of $14.51 per share, resulting in a net loss
on debt extinguishment of approximately $209,000 in other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. No redemption payments
were paid in cash during the year ended December 31, 2024. Interest expense on the 2022 Debenture was approximately $162,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2024, of which approximately $120,000 was attributable to discount amortization), which is reported in other
expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
50
In
June and July 2024, Alpha voluntarily converted the aggregate remaining principal of the 2022 Debenture of $758,922, extinguishing the
Company’s obligations in full with respect to the 2022 Debenture and suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features. As a result
of such voluntary conversions, the Company issued a total of 58,378 shares of common stock at a weighted average conversion price of
$13.00. The Company recorded a gain on voluntary conversions of approximately $85,000 during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of
December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2022 Debenture.
2024
Alpha Debenture (Related party)
On
February 27, 2024, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement executed with Alpha on February 27, 2024 (the “2024 Securities Purchase
Agreement”) we issued to Alpha an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Alpha Debenture”) with a principal amount of
$550,000, for a gross purchase price of $500,000 less expenses. The 2024 Alpha Debenture carried a maturity date of December 31, 2024
and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha’s option, into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion
price initially equal to $30.56 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2024 Alpha Debenture. Upon the closing of the public
offering on September 6, 2024 per the terms of the antidilution provisions in the 2022 Debenture, the conversion price of the 2024 Alpha
Debenture was reduced from $30.56 to $6.50 per share. The 2024 Alpha Debenture accrued interest on its outstanding principal balance
at the rate of 8% per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we also issued to Alpha a noncompensatory equity
classified 5-year common stock purchase warrant (the “2024 Alpha Warrant”) to purchase 18,001 shares of our common stock
at an exercise price initially equal to $13.00 per share (see Note 13 - Stockholders Equity (Deficit)).
Pursuant
to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, we also granted to Alpha an option (the “Option”), exercisable until July 1, 2024,
to purchase from us an additional 8% Convertible Debentures, of like tenor, with a face amount of up to $1.1 million (and with a proportional
number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor, up to a total of 36,001 additional warrants), for a purchase price of $1.0
million.
The
Company evaluated the terms of the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement and determined that the 2024 Alpha Warrant and the Option issued
to Alpha are each considered freestanding financial instruments. The 2024 Alpha Warrant was further determined to initially (i) be indexed
to the Company’s own stock, and (ii) meet all of the additional criteria for permanent equity classification. As the Option required
the Company to issue convertible debt with multiple cash settlement alternatives, the Option was classified as a liability and recognized
at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
The
net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Alpha Debenture were allocated first to the liability-classified Option and the bifurcated
embedded features in the 2024 Alpha Debenture (conversion option, contingent acceleration upon an Event of Default, and contingent interest
upon an Event of Default), with the resulting difference, if any, allocated to the loan host instrument and the equity-classified warrant
on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of the Option was estimated to be $0.8 million at issuance, and the suite of bifurcated
embedded derivative features was $0.08 million. As the fair value of the liability-classified instruments and features exceeded the net
proceeds received, the Company recognized a loss on issuance of convertible debt of $0.4 million, presented in other expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the Company recorded a debt discount at the maximum amount equal to the principal
of $550,000, which was amortized as additional interest expense over the expected term of the 2024 Alpha Debenture.
On
September 9, 2024 we issued 7,842 shares of common stock upon Alpha’s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture
at a conversion price of $6.50 per share for a total of $50,979 in principal. The Company recognized a loss on partial voluntary conversion
of approximately $29,000.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense on the 2024 Alpha Debenture was approximately $486,000, of which approximately $473,000
was attributable to discount amortization), which is reported in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
On
November 20, 2024, in connection with the closing of the Company’s private placement transaction and issuance of Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, the Company used $530,839 of the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Alpha Debenture, in full
settlement of the obligation. The Company recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $68,000 on the settlement date, representing the difference
between (i) the cash reacquisition price, and (ii) the net carrying value of the debt, inclusive of unamortized discounts and issuance
costs and the fair value of the associated suite of bifurcated derivative liabilities on the settlement date. As of December 31, 2024,
there were no amounts outstanding under the 2024 Alpha Debenture.
51
2024
Chen Debenture (Related party)
In
April 2024, Alpha assigned the Option to Yi Hua Chen (“Chen”) and Chen exercised the option in full, in exchange for $1,000,000,
less expenses, we issued to Chen an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Chen Debenture”) with a principal amount of $1,100,000.
The 2024 Chen Debenture carried a maturity date of December 31, 2024 and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Chen’s
option, into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price initially equal to $30.56 per share, subject to adjustment as
described in the 2024 Chen Debenture. Upon the closing of the public offering on September 6, 2024 per the terms of the antidilution
provision, the conversion price of the 2024 Chen Debenture was reduced from $30.56 to $6.50 per share. The 2024 Chen Debenture accrues
interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of 8% per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we
also issued to Chen a 5-year liability classified common stock purchase warrant (the “2024 Chen Warrant”) to purchase 36,001
shares of our common stock at an exercise price initially equal to $13.00 per share (see Note 8 - Warrant Liabilities).
The
Company evaluated the terms of the 2024 Chen Debenture and the 2024 Chen Warrant and determined that the 2024 Chen Warrant was considered
a freestanding financial instrument. The 2024 Chen Warrant was further determined to be indexed to the Company’s own stock. However,
the 2024 Chen Warrant failed to meet the additional criteria for permanent equity classification due to a lack of authorized shares available
to settle the instrument, as the Company was required to obtain shareholder approval to issue all shares underlying the 2024 Securities
Purchase Agreement to comply with the rules of Nasdaq. The Company has adopted a sequencing approach under ASC 815-40, Derivatives
and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity to determine the classification of its contracts at issuance and at each subsequent
reporting date, whereby shares are allocated based on the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments, with the earliest
issuance date receiving the first allocation of shares. In the event of identical issuance dates, shares are then allocated beginning
with instruments with the latest maturity date first. Pursuant to this sequencing approach, as of April 27, 2024, we determined that
the authorized shares were sufficient to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant and was therefore classified in equity. The Company determined
the remaining shares were not sufficient to settle the 2024 Chen Warrant and therefore classified as a liability at fair value,
with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings, until such shareholder approval was obtained on October 25, 2024 (see Note
8 - Warrant Liabilities).
The
net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Chen Debenture, inclusive of the fair value of the settled Option on April 12, 2024 of $0.7
million, was first allocated to the liability-classified 2024 Chen Warrant and the bifurcated embedded features in the 2024 Chen Debenture,
with the resulting difference, if any, allocated to the loan host instrument. As a result, the fair value of the 2024 Chen Warrant at
issuance of $0.6 million at issuance and the suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features of $0.03 million comprised the initial
debt discount, which was amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the 2024 Chen Debenture using the effective interest
method, in accordance with ASC 835-30.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense on the 2024 Chen Debenture was approximately $78,000, of which approximately $23,000
was attributable to discount amortization), which is reported in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
On
November 20, 2024, in connection with the closing of the Company’s private placement transaction and issuance of Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, on November 18, 2024, the Company and Chen executed an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), agreeing to
convert all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the 2024 Chen Debenture as of November 20, 2024 (totaling approximately $1,154,000),
in exchange for 1,154 shares of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock, in full settlement of the Company’s obligations with
respect to the Chen Debenture. The Company recognized a debt extinguishment gain of $13,000 upon conversion, representing the difference
between (i) the reacquisition price, consisting of the fair value of the preferred shares issued, and (ii) the net carrying value of
the debt, inclusive of unamortized discounts and issuance costs and the fair value of the associated suite of bifurcated derivative liabilities
on the settlement date. As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2024 Chen Debenture.

its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of derivative liabilities and transitions to its own volatility as the Company develops
sufficient appropriate history as a public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating

cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any significant changes in the inputs may result
in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.
As

NOTE
10 — EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic
loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss including deemed dividends by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding plus unexercised pre-funded warrants. Diluted EPS is computed based on the sum of the weighted-average number of common
shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable
from preferred stock, convertible debt, stock options and warrants.
These potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from diluted net loss per share as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 because

December 2023 and the aggregate amount that the Company would reimburse ULRF for sponsored research expenses increased to approximately
$2.9 million. In July 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with ULRF for RAS interaction inhibitor drug candidates.
Under the agreement, the Company took over development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the candidates from ULRF and is
responsible for maintenance of the related intellectual property portfolio. In return, ULRF received approximately $112,000 for an upfront
license fee and reimbursement of prior patent costs. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay ULRF (i) royalties, on patent-covered
net sales associated with the commercialization, of 4% (on net sales up to a cumulative $250,000,000) or 5% (on net sales above a cumulative
$250,000,000), until expiration of the licensed patent, and 2.5% (on net sales for any sales not covered by Licensed Patents), (ii) 30%
to 50% of any non-royalty sublicensee income received (50% for sublicenses granted in the first two years of the ULRF license agreement,
40% for sublicenses granted in the third or fourth years of the ULRF license agreement, and 30% for sublicenses granted in the fifth
year of the ULRF license agreement or thereafter), (iii) reimbursements for ongoing costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution
and maintenance of licensed patents, incurred prior to July 2020, and (iv) payments ranging from $50,000 to $5,000,000 upon the achievement
of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. Milestone payments for the first therapeutic indication would be $50,000 for first dosing
in a Phase 1 clinical trial, $100,000 for first dosing in a Phase 2 clinical trial, $150,000 for first dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial,
$300,000 for regulatory marketing approval and $5,000,000 upon achieving a cumulative $500,000,000 of Licensed Product sales. The Company
also must pay ULRF shortfall payments if the total amounts actually paid with respect to royalties and non-royalty sublicensee income
for any year is less than the applicable annual minimum (ranging from $20,000 to $100,000) for such year.
Sponsored
research expenses related to these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0 and $743,000. License costs were
approximately $68,000 and $133,000 related to these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are
included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss.
Between
June 2018 and April 2022, the Company entered into license and sponsored research agreements with ULRF for QN-247, a novel aptamer-based
compound that has shown promise as an anticancer drug. Under the agreements, the Company took over development, regulatory approval and
commercialization of the compound from ULRF and is responsible for maintenance of the related intellectual property portfolio. In return,
ULRF received a $50,000 convertible promissory note in payment of an upfront license fee, which was subsequently converted into the Company’s
common stock, and the Company agreed to reimburse ULRF for sponsored research expenses of up to approximately $805,000 and prior patent
costs of up to $200,000. In addition, the Company agreed to pay ULRF (i) royalties, on patent-covered net sales associated with the commercialization
of anti-nucleolin agent-conjugated nanoparticles, of 4% (on net sales up to a cumulative $250,000,000) or 5% (on net sales above a cumulative
$250,000,000), until expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, (ii) 30% to 50% of any non-royalty sublicensee income
received (50% for sublicenses granted in the first two years of the ULRF license agreement, 40% for sublicenses granted in the third
or fourth years of the ULRF license agreement, and 30% for sublicenses granted in the fifth year of the ULRF license agreement or thereafter),
(iii) reimbursements for ongoing costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of licensed patents, incurred
prior to June 2018, and (iv) payments ranging from $100,000 to $5,000,000 upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.
Milestone payments for the first therapeutic indication would be $100,000 for first dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial, $200,000 for
first dosing in a Phase 2 clinical trial, $350,000 for first dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial, $500,000 for regulatory marketing approval
and $5,000,000 upon achieving a cumulative $500,000,000 of Licensed Product sales. The Company also agreed to pay another $500,000 milestone
payment for any additional regulatory marketing approval for each additional therapeutic (or diagnostic) indication. The Company must
also pay ULRF shortfall payments if the total amounts actually paid with respect to royalties and non-royalty sublicensee income for
any year is less than the applicable annual minimum (ranging from $10,000 to $50,000) for such year.
55
The
sponsored research agreement for QN-247 expired in August 2022 and there were no sponsored research expenses related to these agreements
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. License costs related to these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
were approximately $1,000 and $23,000, respectively, and are included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements
of operations and other comprehensive loss.
Marizyme
On
April 11, 2024, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme. Under the Co-Development Agreement (as amended), we agreed
to pay Marizyme Funding Payments and an Exclusivity Fee of $200,000. The Exclusivity Fee of $200,000 and a Funding Payment of $500,000
was paid to Marizyme on April 12, 2024, and is included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations
and other comprehensive loss. The Exclusivity Fee entitled us to an exclusivity period until May 31, 2024 for purposes of proposing and
outlining a broader strategic relationship with Marizyme with regard to Marizyme’s DuraGraft business. The Funding Payments are
designed to provide financial support for commercialization of Marizyme’s DuraGraft™ vascular conduit solution, which is
indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage of the
saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. In return for the Funding Payments we will receive quarterly a
33% payment in the nature of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of DuraGraft,
capped at double the amount of the Funding Payments provided. No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue until after DuraGraft
has been launched in the United States and a cumulative total of $500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made in the United States.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company advanced $2,257,400 to Marizyme, against which Marizyme had previously
delivered demand promissory notes to the Company. Accrued interest related to the Marizyme Notes was $113,292 and interest income of
this amount was recognized, and a $360,000 loan loss reserve was recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of operations
(see Note 4 - Short Term Notes Receivable).
NOTE
13 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had two classes of authorized capital stock: common stock and preferred stock.
Common
Stock
Holders
of common stock generally vote as a class with the holders of the preferred stock and are entitled to one vote for each share held. Subject
to the rights of the holders of the preferred stock to receive preferential dividends, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors. Following payment of the liquidation preference of the preferred stock, any
remaining assets will be distributed ratably among the holders of the common stock and, on an as-if-converted basis, the holders of any
preferred stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. The holders of common stock have no preemptive,
subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions.
At
December 31, 2024, the Company has reserved 3,593,702 shares of authorized but unissued common stock for possible future issuance as
follows:

There are a total of 15,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized. On
November 18, 2024 a Certificate of Designation for 10,000 shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock was filed.
On
November 20, 2024 in a private placement transaction, the Company sold and issued to certain institutional and accredited investors 5,102
shares of the newly designated Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001
per share (the “Series A-2 Preferred Stock”), at a purchase price of $1,000
per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $5.1
million. The Company also entered into an Exchange Agreement with Yi Hua Chen on November 18, 2024, pursuant to which it issued 1,154
shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock in full settlement of the outstanding balance of the 2024 Chen Debenture of approximately
$1.15
million. At December 31, 2024 the Company had 6,256
shares of Series A-2 preferred stock outstanding.
At
December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
56
The
shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock have the rights, preferences, powers, restrictions and limitations as set forth below.
Conversion
Rights – Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into a number of shares
of common stock equal to $1,000 (the “Stated Value”), divided by a conversion price initially equal to $3.64, subject to
adjustment for any stock splits, stock dividends and similar events (the “Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price is also
subject to “ratchet” antidilution adjustments if the Company at any time while the Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock
is outstanding issues common stock or common stock equivalents at a lower effective price per share than the then-effective Conversion
Price, in all cases subject to a floor price of $1.82. Conversion of the Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock will be prohibited if,
as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 4.99% (or 9.99% at the option
of the holder) of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding. The Conversion Price at December
31, 2024 was $3.64.
Liquidation
Preference – Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, the holders shall be
entitled to an amount equal to the Stated Value for each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock before any distribution or payment shall
be made to the holders of common stock.
Voting
Rights – The holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, together as a single class with the common stock, on all
matters presented to the common stockholders for a vote. Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is entitled to a number of votes equal
to the number of shares into which such share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock would be convertible, as of the record date for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote as to such matter, if the conversion price was equal to the “Minimum Price” (as defined
in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d)) as of November 20, 2024, taking into account for such purposes the beneficial ownership limitation as
then in effect.
Dividends
– The holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when such dividends are paid to holders of
common stock, in the same form and at the same time on an as-converted to common stock basis.
Protective
Provisions – At all times while the Series A-2 Preferred Stock are outstanding, without the consent of the holders of at least
67% of the Stated Value of the then-outstanding Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the Company is prohibited from amending its charter documents
in any manner that adversely affects the rights of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, repurchase junior securities of the Company, pay cash
dividends or distributions on junior securities of the Company, or enter into a material transactions with an affiliate of the Company
(unless it is at arm’s length and expressly approved by a majority of the disinterested directors).
Stock
Options and Warrants
Stock
Options
The
Company recognizes all compensatory share-based payments as compensation expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting
period.
In
April 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), which provides for the granting of incentive
or non-statutory common stock options and other types of awards to qualified employees, officers, directors, consultants and other service
providers. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 1,870 and 7,978 outstanding stock options, respectively, under the 2020 Plan and
on such dates there were 13,244 and 7,136 shares reserved under the 2020 Plan, respectively, for future grant.

There
were approximately $128,000 and $1.1 million of compensation costs related to outstanding options for the years ended December 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $5,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
stock-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.58 years.
The
exercise price for an option issued under the 2020 Plan is determined by the Board of Directors, but will be (i) in the case of an incentive
stock option (A) granted to an employee who, at the time of grant of such option, is a 10% stockholder, no less than 110% of the fair
market value per share on the date of grant; or (B) granted to any other employee, no less than 100% of the fair market value per share
on the date of grant; and (ii) in the case of a non-statutory stock option, no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the
date of grant. The options awarded under the 2020 Plan will vest as determined by the Board of Directors but will not exceed a ten-year
period. A forfeiture is recognized as incurred if the option holder does not exercise after 90 days following termination of service.
Fair
Value of Equity Awards
The
Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value awards under its equity plans. Key valuation assumptions include:
●Expected
dividend yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the Company has never
paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on the Company’s common
stock.
●Expected
stock-price volatility. The Company’s expected volatility is derived from the average
historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within the Company’s industry
that the Company considers to be comparable to the Company’s business over a period
approximately equal to the expected term, because the Company does not have sufficient stock
price history over the expected term.
●Risk-free
interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect
at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal
to the expected term.
●Expected
term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected
to be outstanding. The Company’s historical share option exercise experience does not
provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because of a lack of sufficient
data. Therefore, the Company estimates the expected term by using the simplified method provided
by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting
and the contractual life of the options.

Equity
Classified Compensatory Warrants
As
part of the May 2020 reverse recapitalization transaction, the Company issued equity classified compensatory common stock warrants to
an advisor and its designees. In addition, various service providers hold equity classified compensatory common stock warrants issued
in 2017 and earlier (originally exercisable to purchase Series C convertible preferred stock, and now instead exercisable to purchase
common stock). These are to be differentiated from the Series C Warrants described in Note 8 – Warrant Liabilities.
On
February 27, 2024, as a result of a down-round provision triggered by a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alpha for the purchase of
the February 2024 Debenture, 1,353 warrants were repriced from $36.50 per share exercise price to $13.50 per share exercise price. The
increase in fair value of $9,737 for the modification of these warrants was charged to general and administrative expenses in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. On September 6, 2024 as a result of a down-round provision triggered by
shares sold in the public offering, these 1,353 warrants were repriced again from $13.50 per share exercise price to $6.50 per share
exercise price. The increase in fair value of $2,299 for the modification of these warrants was charged to general and administrative
expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
On
November 20, 2024, the Company closed its private placement transaction resulting in the issuance of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred
Stock. As a result of the issuance of a new class of voting securities, the Company evaluated its equity classified compensatory warrants’
respective terms, and concluded that compensatory warrants to purchase 1,353 common shares with a weighted average exercise price of
$6.50 and a fair value of $904 were required to be reclassified to liabilities as of November 20, 2024.
No
new compensatory warrants were issued during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.

There

Noncompensatory
Equity Classified Warrants
On
May 22, 2020, as a commitment fee, the Company issued noncompensatory equity classified warrants to Alpha for the purchase of common
stock, of which warrants for 141 common shares remain outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2024 and may be exercised in whole
or in part, at any time before May 22, 2025.
On
December 22, 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of a debenture to Alpha (see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), the Company issued
to Alpha a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The exercise price of this warrant was initially $82.50,
and may be exercised in whole or in part, on or after June 22, 2023 and at any time before June 22, 2028. On December 5, 2023, the Company
entered into an Amendment No. 1 with regard to the related Securities Purchase Agreement, with Alpha. This Amendment reduced the Exercise
Price of the December 22, 2022 warrant from $82.50 per share to $36.50 per share. The Amendment also revised certain provisions of the
warrant which resulted in reclassification of the warrant from liabilities to equity during the year ended December 31, 2023.
On
February 27, 2024 the Company entered into a new Securities Purchase Agreement with Alpha for the purchase of the February 2024 Debenture
(see Note 9 – Convertible Debt). This Securities Purchase Agreement resulted in the reduction of the exercise price of the December
22, 2022 warrant and the May 2020 warrant from $36.50 per share to $13.00 per share. The company recognized a deemed dividend of $60,017,
which represents the incremental fair value of the outstanding warrants as a result of the down-round provision. As the Company has an
accumulated deficit, the deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net impact of zero
to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. In addition, on February 27, 2024,
the Company issued to Alpha a warrant to purchase 18,001 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $13.00 per
share, which may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time before February 27, 2029.
On
September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision triggered by shares sold in a public offering, the above warrants were repriced
from $13.00 per share exercise price to $6.50 per share exercise price. The company recognized an additional deemed dividend of $27,587,
which represents the incremental fair value of the outstanding warrants as a result of the down-round provision. As the Company has an
accumulated deficit, the deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net impact of zero
to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit).
As
a result of a partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture on September 9, 2024, the Company no longer had sufficient shares
to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until shareholder approval was obtained, and a portion (2,314 warrant shares with a fair value
of $14,997) was reclassified to liabilities (see Note 8 – Warrant Liabilities). Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained
on October 25, 2024, and as of that date, the Company determined that shareholder approval resulted in equity classification for the
warrant again and, accordingly, the Company remeasured the warrant liability to fair value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity
classified warrants.
60
On
September 6, 2024, upon the closing of a public offering, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase 239,456 common shares at
a price of $6.45 per share with an exercise price of $0.05 per share (the “pre-funded warrants”). The pre-funded warrants
are exercisable upon issuance and will remain exercisable until all the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. Pre-funded warrants
for 188,257 common shares were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024 pre-funded warrants for 51,199
common shares remained outstanding.
On
September 6, 2024, upon the closing of a public offering, 16,019 warrants were issued to the placement agent. These warrants were not
exercisable until March 5, 2025 and expire on September 6, 2029.
On
November 20, 2024, the Company closed its private placement transaction resulting in the issuance of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred
Stock. As a result of the issuance of a new class of voting securities, the Company evaluated its equity classified noncompensatory warrants’
respective terms, and concluded that non-compensatory warrants for 67,359 common shares with a weighted average exercise price of $1.91
and an aggregate fair value of $246,357 were required to be reclassified to liabilities as of November 20, 2024.

(Deficit)).
See
Note 9 – Convertible Debt for additional information concerning convertible debt – related party transactions.
Warrants
On
May 22, 2020, as a commitment fee, the Company issued warrants to Alpha for the purchase of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, 141
of these warrants remain outstanding and exercisable, and may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time before May 22, 2025. During
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 there were no exercises of this warrant. This warrant was equity classified as of December 31,
2023 and was reclassified to warrant liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 8 - Warrant Liabilities).
On
December 22, 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of a debenture to Alpha, the Company issued to Alpha a warrant to purchase 50,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. This warrant may be exercised by Alpha, in whole or in part, on or after June 22, 2023 and
at any time before June 22, 2028, subject to certain terms and conditions described in the warrant. During the year ended December 31,
2024, Alpha partially exercised this warrant to purchase 31,998 shares respectively, of the Company’s common stock at a weighted
average exercise price of $13.00, for total cumulative proceeds to the Company of $416,000. During the year ended December 31, 2023,
there were no exercises of this warrant. This warrant is included in equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (see Note
13 – Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)).
On
February 27, 2024, in conjunction with the issuance of a debenture to Alpha, the Company issued to Alpha, a warrant to purchase 18,001
shares of the Company’s common stock, exercisable in whole or in part, until February 27, 2029, subject to certain terms and conditions
described in the warrant.
On September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision triggered
by shares sold in a public offering, the above warrants were repriced from $13.00 per share exercise price to $6.50 per share exercise
price. The company recognized an additional deemed dividend of $27,587, which represents the incremental fair value of the outstanding
warrants as a result of the down-round provision. As the Company has an accumulated deficit, the deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction
in additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net impact of zero to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated statements of changes
in stockholders’ equity (deficit).
As a result of a partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture
on September 9, 2024, the Company no longer had sufficient shares to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until shareholder approval
was obtained, and a portion (2,314 warrant shares with a fair value of $14,997) was reclassified to liabilities (see Note 8 – Warrant
Liabilities). Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024, and as of that date, the Company determined that shareholder
approval resulted in equity classification for the warrant again and, accordingly, the Company remeasured the warrant liability to fair
value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no exercises of this warrant. This warrant is included
in equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)).
As
of December 31, 2024, the exercise price of all of the above warrants issued to Alpha was $6.50.
On
April 12, 2024, in connection with the issuance of a debenture to Chen (see Note 9 – Convertible Debt), the Company issued a liability
classified warrant to Chen to purchase 36,001 shares of common stock, exercisable until February 27, 2029. On September 6, 2024, as a
result of a down-round provision triggered by shares sold in a public offering, the warrant was repriced from an exercise price of $13.00
per share to an exercise price of $6.50 per share. The warrant was initially liability classified due to an insufficient number of authorized
shares to settle the warrant prior to the receipt of shareholder approval, which was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024. As of
that date, the Company determined that shareholder approval resulted in equity classification for the warrant and accordingly, the Company
remeasured the warrant liability to fair value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants (see Note 13 – Stockholders
Equity (Deficit)). The fair value of this warrant was $565,582 on the issuance date and $185,531 on the date of reclassification to equity.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $380,051 for this
warrant.

Based
on the available objective evidence, including the Company’s history of cumulative losses, management believes it is likely that
the Company’s U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets will not be realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full
valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.
Due
to the full valuation allowance already in place on the Company’s U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets, the Company does
not anticipate significant changes in the Company’s effective tax rate.
The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in significant changes to the treatment of research or experimental (“R&E”) expenditures
under Section 174. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, taxpayers are required to capitalize and amortize all R&E expenditures
that are paid or incurred in connection with their trade or business which represent costs in the experimental or laboratory sense. Specifically,
costs for U.S. based R&E activities must be amortized over five years and costs for foreign R&E activities must be amortized
over 15 years; both using a midyear convention. The Company has incorporated the impact of this new tax legislation into its 2022, 2023,
and 2024 consolidated financial statements, noting that the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements was immaterial.
At
December 31, 2024, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,946,000
and $5,403,000,
respectively, which are available to offset future taxable income. U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried
forward indefinitely. State net operating loss carryovers begin to expire in 2043.
The
Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under sections 382 and 383 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), and similar state provisions if the Company experienced one or more ownership
changes, which would limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized to offset future taxable
income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by section 382, results from equity shifts that increase ownership
of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. As a result of the
May 2020 reverse recapitalization transaction, a section 382 ownership change has occurred. Prior to the reverse recapitalization transaction,
the Ritter business was discontinued resulting in any pre-ownership change net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards becoming fully
limited under section 382. The pre-ownership change net operating losses and tax credit carryforward DTAs are considered worthless and
have been written-off the deferred tax table presented above. Subsequent ownership changes may have also occurred due to the Company’s
equity activity in recent years. The Company has not completed an Internal Revenue Code Section 382 analysis. As a result, there could
be additional limitations on the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These additional
limitations may result in both a permanent loss of certain tax benefits related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and
an annual utilization limitation.
The
Company also has research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $323,000 and $235,000,
respectively. The research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2043 for federal tax purposes and have an indefinite
life for state tax purposes.
The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in California. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns
remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s California income tax returns remain subject to examination
by the California Franchise Tax Board. Due to net operating losses, research and development credits and other tax credit carryforwards
that may be utilized in future years, all U.S. federal and state tax years are open to examination.
Generally
accepted accounting principles clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s financial statements
and prescribe thresholds for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return, and also provide guidance on de-recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The Company adopted these provisions effective April 1, 2009.
64
The
Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $279,105
as of December 31, 2024. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in unrecognized tax benefits would have no
effect on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not foresee any material changes over the next 12 months. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company will recognize interest and penalties accrued on any
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not accrued any interest or
penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls
and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.
Based
on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer) of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, each of the
individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis.
Management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on
this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
based on those criteria due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
65
Material
Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the year ended December 31, 2024 audit, we identified the lack of sufficient number of personnel within the
accounting function to adequately segregate duties, the Company did not have a designed and implemented effective Information Technology
General Controls (“ITGC”) related to access controls to financial accounting system, and the Company did not have formalized
documentation of its processes and controls that could be evaluated for proper design and implementation.
We
lack the resources to employ additional personnel to help mitigate these material weaknesses and we foresee that these material weaknesses
will not be remediated until we receive additional funding to support our accounting department.
We
cannot assure you that these or other measures will fully remediate the material weakness in a timely manner. Notwithstanding the identified
material weakness, our management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent in all
material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S.
GAAP.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other
than with respect to the remediation efforts discussed above, there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina. Mr. Richardson’s extensive experience in leading strategic
and turnaround efforts in various small cap companies contributed to our board of directors’ conclusion that he should serve
as a director of our company.

has also been president or Orchid Capital Partners Corp. since 2014, and has over 20 years of experience in investment banking, including

a principal stockholder since its formation. He has remained the largest stockholder through companies he controls and recently assumed
the role of Chairman in 2024. We believe that Mr. Lichti’s extensive experience as a director and advisor to multiple publicly

a qualified director for our Company.

deep regulatory knowledge, and exemplary leadership skills contributed to our board of directors’ conclusion that he should serve
as a director of our company.
Graydon
Bensler. Mr. Bensler is currently serving as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director of PMGC Holdings

since 2020 and 2024, respectively. Mr. Bensler is a financial professional and analyst with over seven years of experience in financial
consulting and management for both private businesses and US/Canadian publicly traded companies and is a CFA Charterholder (CFA) In 2017,
Mr. Bensler Co-founded an Ed Tech curriculum management and scheduling company that was implanted in academic schools in Canada and the
United States. From 2017 to 2019, Mr. Bensler was an account manager at a leading Canadian investor relations firm where he represented
publicly traded companies across a wide range of sectors where he worked directly with investment banks, investment brokers and company
executives and directors. During his tenure, Mr. Bensler created and conveyed messaging about his clients’ strategic position in
the market and successfully guided several companies through multiple financings. From 2019 to 2021, Mr. Bensler was a Senior Associate

publicly traded Health Logic Interactive Inc. (TSXv: CHIP) from 2020 to 2024. Mr. Bensler received his Bachelor of Management and Organizational

and his having served as an account manager for similarly situated companies makes him a qualified director for our Company.

Meetings
of the Board of Directors
During
our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Board met from time to time informally and acted by written consent on numerous occasions.
Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings
To
our knowledge, none of our current directors or executive officers has, during the past 10 years:
●
been
convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses);
●
had
any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business
association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two (2)
years prior to that time;
●
been
subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction
or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his or her involvement
in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to
be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;
●
been
found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;
●
been
the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently
reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged
violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions
or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution,
civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting
mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or
70
●
been
the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization
(as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange
Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons
associated with a member.
Indemnification
and Limitation on Liability of Directors
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law. Nothing contained in the provisions will be construed to deprive any director of his or her right to all defenses ordinarily
available to the director nor will anything herein be construed to deprive any director of any right he or she may have for contribution
from any other director or other person.
At
present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification
will be required or permitted. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors,
officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the
SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Employment
Agreements
Employment
Agreement with Michael Poirier
Mr.
Poirier is party to an Executive Employment Agreement dated February 1, 2017, as amended January 9, 2018 (the “Poirier Employment
Agreement”). The Poirier Employment Agreement had an initial three-year term and was automatically renewed for successive one-year
periods unless either party gave notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days before the end of such a one-year period.
Under
the terms of the Poirier Employment Agreement, Mr. Poirier was entitled to an annual base salary of at least $315,000, was eligible to
participate in the Company’s bonus plans, benefit programs and medical benefits, was eligible for certain event-based bonuses (including
for “Liquidity Event” acquisition transactions), and is entitled to four weeks of vacation per year. If Mr. Poirier’s
employment was terminated without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Poirier Employment Agreement),
and he provided a general release to the Company, he would be entitled to one year of salary continuation plus the cost of COBRA coverage
continuation for such one year period. In May 2021, our board of directors and its compensation committee increased Mr. Poirier’s
annual base salary to $575,000. On January 13, 2023, the Company’s board of directors, as part of certain cost-cutting measures,
approved a temporary 20% reduction to the base salaries of all executive officers of the Company. Accordingly, on January 16, 2023, Mr.
Poirier’s base salary was reduced to $460,000; it was subsequently restored in August 2023. On September 23, 2024,
Mr. Poirier resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and was paid all amounts due under his Employment
Agreement. Such amounts are included in the table above.
71
Employment
Agreement with Christopher Lotz
Mr.
Lotz is party to an Executive Employment Agreement dated February 1, 2017, as amended January 9, 2018 (the “Lotz Employment Agreement”).
The Lotz Employment Agreement had an initial three-year term and was automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless either
party gave notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days before the end of such a one-year period.
Under
the terms of the Lotz Employment Agreement, Mr. Lotz was entitled to an annual base salary of at least $225,000, was eligible to participate
in the Company’s bonus plans, benefit programs and medical benefits, was eligible for certain event-based bonuses (including for
“Liquidity Event” acquisition transactions), and is entitled to four weeks of vacation per year. If Mr. Lotz’s employment
is terminated without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Lotz Employment Agreement), and he provides
a general release to the Company, he would be entitled to 180 days of salary continuation plus the cost of COBRA coverage continuation
for such 180 day period. In May 2021, our board of directors and its compensation committee increased Mr. Lotz’s annual base salary
to $300,000. On January 13, 2023, the Company’s board of directors, as part of certain cost-cutting measures, approved a temporary

salary was reduced to $240,000; it was subsequently restored in August 2023. On September 23, 2024, Mr. Lotz resigned from his position
as Chief Financial Officer and was paid all amounts due under his Employment Agreement. Such amounts are included in the table above.
Stock
Incentive Plan
The
material terms of our 2020 Stock Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2020 Plan”) are outlined below. This summary is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2020 Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Authorized
Shares. We have reserved an aggregate of 755,702 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2020 Plan. The number of shares
is subject to adjustment in the event of any recapitalization, stock split, reclassification, stock dividend or other change in our capitalization.
In addition, the following shares of our common stock will be available for grant and issuance under the 2020 Plan:
●
shares
subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), granted under the 2020 Plan that cease to be subject
to the stock option or SAR for any reason other than exercise of the stock option or SAR;
●
shares
subject to awards granted under the 2020 Plan that are subsequently forfeited or repurchased by us at the original issue price;
●
shares
subject to awards granted under the 2020 Plan that otherwise terminate without shares being issued;
●
shares
surrendered, canceled, or exchanged for cash or a different award (or combination thereof); and
●
shares
subject to awards under the 2020 Plan that are used to pay the exercise price of an award or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding
obligations related to any award.
Plan
Administration. The 2020 Plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee or by our board of directors acting in place of
our Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee will have the authority to construe and interpret the 2020 Plan, grant awards
and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2020 Plan.
Awards
and Eligible Participants. The 2020 Plan authorizes the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock unit,
performance awards and stock bonuses. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of awards to our employees, directors, consultants and independent
contractor service providers, subject to certain exceptions. No non-employee director may be granted awards under the 2020 Plan in any
calendar year that, taken together with any cash fees paid by us to such non-employee director during such calendar year, exceed $5,000,000
(calculating the value of any award based on the grant date fair value determined in accordance with GAAP). No more than 98,000,000 shares
of our common stock will be issued under the 2020 Plan pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options.
Stock
Options. The 2020 Plan permits us to grant incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options
will be determined by our Compensation Committee, and may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date
of grant. Our Compensation Committee has the authority to reprice any outstanding stock option (by reducing the exercise price, or canceling
the stock option in exchange for cash or another equity award) under the 2020 Plan without the approval of our stockholders. Stock options
may vest based on the passage of time or the achievement of performance conditions in the discretion of our compensation committee. Our
Compensation Committee may provide for stock options to be exercised only as they vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares
issued on exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the shares vest. The maximum term of stock options granted
under the 2020 Plan is 10 years.
72
Stock
Appreciation Rights. SARs provide for a payment to the holder, in cash or shares of our common stock, based upon the difference between
the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise and the stated exercise price on the date of grant, up to a maximum
amount of cash or number of shares. SARs may vest based on the passage of time or the achievement of performance conditions in the discretion
of our Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee has the authority to reprice any outstanding SAR (by reducing the exercise
price, or canceling the SAR in exchange for cash or another equity award) under the 2020 Plan without the approval of our stockholders.
Restricted
Stock Awards. A restricted stock award represents the issuance to the holder of shares of our common stock, subject to the forfeiture
of those shares in the event of failure to achieve certain performance conditions or termination of employment. The purchase price, if
any, for the shares will be determined by our Compensation Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator at the time of
award, vesting will cease on the date the holder no longer provides services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to us or can
be repurchased by us.
Restricted
Stock Units. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) represent the right on the part of the holder to receive shares of our common
stock at a specified date in the future, subject to forfeiture of that right in the event of failure to achieve certain performance conditions
or termination of employment. If a RSU has not been forfeited, then, on the specified date, we will deliver to the holder of the RSU
shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, as previously determined by the Compensation
Committee at the time of the award.
Performance
Awards. Performance awards cover a number of shares of our common stock that may be settled upon achievement of performance conditions
as provided in the 2020 Plan in cash or by issuance of the underlying common stock. These awards are subject to forfeiture before settlement
in the event of failure to achieve certain performance conditions or termination of employment.
Stock
Bonuses. Stock bonuses may be granted as additional compensation for past or future service or performance and, therefore, no payment
will be required from a participant for any shares awarded under a stock bonus. Unless otherwise determined by our Compensation Committee
at the time of award, vesting will cease on the date the holder no longer provides services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited
to us.
Change-in-Control.
If we are party to a merger or consolidation, sale of all or substantially all our assets or similar change-in-control transaction, outstanding
awards, including any vesting provisions, may be assumed or substituted by the successor company. In the alternative, the successor company
may issue, in place of outstanding shares held by a 2020 Plan participant, substantially similar shares or other property subject to
repurchase obligations no less favorable to the participant. Outstanding awards that are not assumed, substituted or cashed out will
accelerate in full and expire immediately before the transaction, and awards will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the
administrator.
Amendment;
Termination. The 2020 Plan will terminate 10 years from April 8, 2020, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors.
Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the 2020 Plan at any time, subject to compliance with applicable law.
Federal
Income Tax Summary. The following is a brief summary of the principal federal income tax consequences to us and to an eligible person
(who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (a “Participant”) of awards that
may be granted under the 2020 Plan. The summary is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other things, does not describe state, local
or foreign tax consequences. The federal income tax consequences of an eligible person’s award under the 2020 Plan are complex,
are subject to change and differ from person to person. Each person should consult with his or her own tax adviser as to his or her own
particular situation.
This
discussion is based on the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, Internal Revenue Service rulings, judicial decisions
and administrative rulings as of the date of this proxy statement, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, including
changes and interpretations with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the tax treatment described herein will remain unchanged
at the time that awards under the 2020 Plan are made.
73
A
Participant will not recognize income upon the grant of an option or at any time prior to the exercise of the option. At the time the
participant exercises a non-qualified option, he or she will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to
the excess of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is exercised over the price paid for the common stock,
and we will then be entitled to a corresponding deduction.
A
Participant who exercises an incentive stock option will not be taxed at the time he or she exercises his or her options or a portion
thereof. Instead, he or she will be taxed at the time he or she sells the common stock purchased pursuant to the option. The Participant
will be taxed on the excess of the amount for which he or she sells the stock over the price he or she had paid for the stock. If the
Participant does not sell the stock prior to two years from the date of grant of the option and one year from the date the stock is transferred
to him or her upon exercise, the gain will be capital gain and we will not get a corresponding deduction. If the Participant sells the
stock at a gain prior to that time, the difference between the amount the Participant paid for the stock and the lesser of the fair market
value on the date of the exercise or the amount for which the stock is sold, will be taxed as ordinary income and we will be entitled
to a corresponding deduction. If the Participant sells the stock for less than the amount he or she paid for the stock prior to the one
or two year periods indicated, no amount will be taxed as ordinary income and the loss will be taxed as a capital loss.
A
Participant generally will not recognize income upon the grant of a stock appreciation right or a restricted stock unit. At the time
a Participant receives shares or cash payment under any such award, he or she generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary
income in an amount equal to the cash or the fair market value of the common stock received, less any amount paid for the stock, and
we will then be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Upon a subsequent sale of the shares received under the stock appreciation right
or restricted stock unit, if any, the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the Participant’s tax basis (the amount
previously included in income) is generally taxable as a capital gain or loss, which will be short-term or long-term depending on the
Participant’s holding time of such shares.
The
taxation of restricted stock is dependent on the actions taken by the Participant. Generally, absent an election to be taxed currently
under Section 83(b) of the Code, or an 83(b) election, there will be no federal income tax consequences to the Participant upon the grant
of a restricted stock award. At the lapse of the restrictions or satisfaction of the conditions on the restricted stock, the Participant
will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of our common stock at that time. If the Participant makes an 83(b) election
within 30 days of the date of grant, he or she will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the
time of grant, determined without regard to the applicable restrictions. If an 83(b) election is made, no additional income will be recognized
by the Participant upon the lapse of the restrictions or satisfaction of the conditions on the restricted stock award. We generally should
be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the Participant, at the same time as the ordinary income
is recognized by the Participant. Upon a subsequent sale of the formerly restricted stock, the difference between the amount realized
on the sale and the Participant’s tax basis (the amount previously included in income) is generally taxable as a capital gain or
loss, which will be short-term or long-term depending on the Participant’s holding time of such shares.
The
tax consequences to Participants who receive performance-based awards depend on the particular type of award issued. Our ability to take
a deduction for such awards similarly depends on the terms of the awards and the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, if applicable.
Section 162(m) of the Code currently imposes a $1 million limit on the amount that a public company may deduct for compensation paid
to an employee who is chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or another “covered employee” (as defined by Section
162(m)), or was such an employee beginning in any year after 2017. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to establish the
compensation paid or intended to be paid or awarded to the executive officers as the Compensation Committee may determine is in the best
interest of us and our stockholders, and without regard to any limitation provided in Section 162(m). This discretion is an important
feature of the Compensation Committee’s compensation practices because it provides the Compensation Committee with sufficient flexibility
to respond to specific circumstances facing us.

Outstanding
Equity Awards at December 31, 2024
The
following table presents the outstanding stock options and compensatory warrants held by each of the named executive officers as of December
31, 2024. There were no direct stock awards, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights outstanding at December 31, 2024. All
pre-2020 “option” awards shown were initially issued as Qualigen, Inc. Series C Warrants, and became warrants exercisable
instead for our common stock (at an adjusted exercise price) upon the Reverse Recapitalization Transaction. The share numbers and exercise
prices in the table below reflect the reverse stock split effected on November 5, 2024 (the “Reverse Stock Split”).

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Our
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing any transaction between the Company and its directors, director
nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% beneficial owners, and each of their respective immediate family members, where the amount
involved exceeds the lesser of (i) $120,000 and (ii) 1% of the average of our total assets at year-end for the prior two fiscal years.
Since January 1, 2023, there have been no such transactions except as described below.
2022
Convertible Debenture
On
December 5, 2023, the Company and Alpha executed Amendment No. 1 to the 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA Amendment”),
pursuant to which the Company and Alpha agreed to, among other things, reduce the Conversion Price of the 2022 Debenture from $66.00
per share to $36.50 per share and reduce the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant from $82.50 per share to $36.50 per share, in each case
subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the SPA Amendment revised certain provisions of the 2022 Warrant to (i) limit the circumstances
which would trigger a potential adjustment to the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant and (ii) clarify the treatment of the 2022 Warrant
upon a Fundamental Transaction.
During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued a total of (i) 16,834 shares of our common stock upon Alpha’s partial voluntary
conversion of the 2022 Debenture at a conversion price of $66.00 per share, extinguishing a total of $1,111,078 principal, and (ii) 6,193
shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments totaling $220,000 due on the 2022 Debenture at a weighted
average conversion price of $35.52 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid monthly redemption payments of
$550,000 in cash.
On
February 27, 2024, in connection with the issuance of an additional warrant to Alpha with an exercise price of $13.00 per share, and
pursuant to certain antidilution provisions in the 2022 Debenture, the Conversion Price of the 2022 Debenture was reduced from $36.50
per share to $13.00 per share.
78
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued a total of 45,496 shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption
payments totaling $660,000 due on the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average conversion price of $14.51 per share. No redemption payments
were paid in cash during the year ended December 31, 2024.
In
June and July 2024, Alpha voluntarily converted the aggregate remaining principal of the 2022 Debenture of $758,922. As a result of such
voluntary conversions, the Company issued a total of 58,378 shares of common stock at a weighted average conversion price of $13.00.
As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2022 Debenture.
2024
Convertible Debenture
On
February 27, 2024, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement executed with Alpha on February 27, 2024 (the “2024 Securities Purchase
Agreement”) we issued to Alpha an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Alpha Debenture”) with a principal amount of
$550,000, for a gross purchase price of $500,000 less expenses. The 2024 Alpha Debenture carried a maturity date of December 31, 2024
and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha’s option, into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion
price initially equal to $30.56 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2024 Alpha Debenture. Upon the closing of the public
offering on September 6, 2024 per the terms of the antidilution provisions in the 2024 Debenture, the conversion price of the 2024 Alpha
Debenture was reduced from $30.56 to $6.50 per share. The 2024 Alpha Debenture accrued interest on its outstanding principal balance
at the rate of 8% per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we also issued to Alpha a noncompensatory equity
classified 5-year common stock purchase warrant (the “2024 Alpha Warrant”) to purchase 18,001 shares of our common
stock at an exercise price initially equal to $13.00 per share, which may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time before February
27, 2029. On September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision triggered by shares sold in the public offering, the above warrants
were repriced from $13.00 per share exercise price to $6.50 per share exercise price. As a result of a partial voluntary conversion of
the 2024 Alpha Debenture on September 9, 2024, the Company no longer had sufficient shares to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until
shareholder approval was obtained, and a portion (2,314 warrant shares with a fair value of $14,997) was reclassified to liabilities.
Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024, and as of that date, the Company determined that shareholder approval
resulted in equity classification for the warrant and, accordingly, the Company remeasured the warrant liability to fair value, and reclassified
to noncompensatory equity classified warrants.
Pursuant
to the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, we also granted to Alpha an option (the “Option”), exercisable until July 1, 2024,
to purchase from us an additional 8% Convertible Debentures, of like tenor, with a face amount of up to $1.1 million (and with a proportional
number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor, up to a total of 36,001 additional warrants), for a purchase price of $1.0
million.
On
September 9, 2024, we issued 7,842 shares of common stock upon Alpha’s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture
at a conversion price of $6.50 per share for a total of $50,979 in principal.
On
November 20, 2024, in connection with the closing of the Company’s private placement transaction and issuance of Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, the Company used $530,839 of the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Alpha Debenture, in full
settlement of the obligation. As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2024 Alpha Debenture.
2024
Additional Convertible Debenture
In
April 2024, Alpha assigned the Option to Yi Hua Chen (“Chen”) and Chen exercised the option in full, in exchange for $1,000,000,
less expenses, we issued to Chen an 8% Convertible Debenture (the “2024 Chen Debenture”) with a principal amount of $1,100,000.
The 2024 Chen Debenture carried a maturity date of December 31, 2024 and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Chen’s
option, into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price initially equal to $30.56 per share, subject to adjustment as
described in the 2024 Chen Debenture. Upon the closing of the public offering on September 6, 2024, per the terms of the antidilution
provision, the conversion price of the 2024 Chen Debenture was reduced from $30.56 to $6.50 per share. The 2024 Chen Debenture accrues
interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of 8% per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we
also issued to Chen a 5-year liability classified common stock purchase warrant (the “2024 Chen Warrant”) to purchase
36,001 shares of our common stock at an exercise price initially equal to $13.00 per share, exercisable until February 27, 2029. On September 6, 2024, as a
result of a down-round provision triggered by shares sold in the public offering, the warrant was repriced from an exercise price of $13.00
per share to an exercise price of $6.50 per share. The warrant was initially liability classified due to an insufficient number of authorized
shares to settle the warrant prior to the receipt of shareholder approval, which was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024. As of
that date, the Company determined that shareholder approval resulted in equity classification for the warrant and accordingly, the Company
remeasured the warrant liability to fair value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants.
On
November 20, 2024, in connection with the closing of the Company’s private placement transaction and issuance of Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, on November 18, 2024, the Company and Chen executed an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), agreeing to
convert all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the 2024 Chen Debenture as of November 20, 2024, totaling approximately $1,154,000,
in exchange for 1,154 shares of newly designated Series A-2 Preferred Stock, in full settlement of the Company’s obligations with
respect to the Chen Debenture. As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2024 Chen Debenture.
