We have a significant competitive advantage with our scale of data, data services, AI capabilities, ecosystem of applications, and our large network of AI-enabled human experts to become the all-in-one platform for consumers, businesses, and accountants.

Combined with our AI-enabled human experts, these agents are automating workflows and delivering real-time insights to drive growth and improve cash flow. Our redesigned user interface and new business feed highlights these real-time insights and recommendations and the tasks completed by agents on behalf of the customer. We also launched AI agents in Intuit Enterprise Suite, including accounting, payments, finance, and project management agents, transforming how our small and mid-market business customers manage their finances by automating a variety of day-to-day tasks, and increasing productivity.Our innovation has been possible with the investments in our proprietary Generative AI Operating System (GenOS), which have enabled us to fuel innovation with unparalleled speed for our customers.

To succeed in these markets, continuous investment is required to innovate, develop new products and services, and enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license products and technology from third parties and establish other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.Our offerings have rapid development cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.We continue to make substantial investments in research and development. We expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with done-for-you experiences, financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including global offerings, and undertaking significant research and development for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.SEASONALITYOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.MARKETING, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELSMarkets Our primary customers are consumers and small and mid-market businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants. We partner with financial institutions and other partners, who we connect with consumers on our platform. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. The widespread usage of mobile devices and social media, along with the evolution of AI, has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized how customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.Real-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, and other changes in the way we do business.Marketing ProgramsWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing, such as TV and radio advertising; digital marketing, such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search and generative engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; email marketing; in-product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services; public relations; 8 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentssponsorships; podcast marketing; mobile marketing; and retail marketing of our consumer tax offerings. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross-sell additional offerings.Sales and Distribution ChannelsDirect Channel. We offer our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct online offerings are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase and other decisions regarding our and our partners’ offerings based on content provided on our websites, or via other online content and word-of-mouth recommendations. For many of our products, assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers who want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on accountants, bookkeepers, and marketing professionals, and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our business and professional tax solutions. We market certain products directly to mid-market businesses through our direct sales force. Multi-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers primarily research products and services online. Many customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Some research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.Online App Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices.Partner and Other Channels. We offer many of our products and services through partners and other channels, including value-added resellers, technology partners with complementary platforms, accountants, bookkeepers, marketing professionals, and professional service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our TurboTax Desktop offerings at retail locations across the U.S. and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.COMPETITIONWe face intense competition in all aspects of our businesses across all of our offerings. Competition is rapidly evolving, fragmented, and involves complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the market segments we serve have grown markedly over the past few years, and the marketing and distribution channels continue to evolve. We expect these trends to continue. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing, and other resources, have greater brand recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and partners, advertise aggressively, or beat us to market with new products and services.The competitive landscape is constantly evolving. This occurs as we expand into new market segments and geographic regions and extend our capabilities, as well as when new companies emerge or existing companies extend their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the market segments and geographic regions in which we operate. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global financial technology company and the customer problems that we aim to solve, we compete with offerings from a variety of organizations across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups, and professional services. Entities that offer or provide access to offerings that we may compete with include:•business software providers, including industry-specific vertical software providers and embedded software providers, that offer solutions such as accounting, business management and financial software, marketing automation, customer relationship management, inventory management, payroll and workforce management;•private and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers, including embedded software providers;•accounting, consulting, and tax firms; •companies and banks that provide money services, including merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking and savings accounts, financing and point of sale devices; •companies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, credit-building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress;•companies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings;•financial institutions; •credit bureaus; and•platform companies that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face.We believe our most important competitive factors are our innovation and technology capabilities, functionality, ease of use, and security of our offerings, the integration of our offerings with each other and third-party offerings, brand recognition and reputation, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance.  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K9Table of ContentsCUSTOMER SUCCESSFor many of our offerings, we provide support through multiple channels including telephone, email, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.We also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation, and bookkeeping services.Our customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts.

We augment the services we provide with outsourced partnerships domestically and internationally. A majority of our outsourced customer success personnel are based domestically, with additional international teams located primarily in the Philippines and Canada.We also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities.

Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24/7 support and additional contact channel options.MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTIONOnline Products and ServicesOur online offerings include QuickBooks Online, Intuit Enterprise Suite, online payroll services, merchant payment processing and bill pay services, Mailchimp’s marketing automation and customer relationship offerings, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, and Credit Karma offerings. We use public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, for most of our systems, networks, and databases used to operate these online offerings.Desktop Software and SuppliesOur desktop software customers generally electronically download software as demand for physical packaged products has declined. When supplies are ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order, and backlog is minimal.PRIVACY AND SECURITYWe host, collect, process, use, and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data from our customers, users, workforce, and third-party partners. We are stewards of this data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using, and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in these principles, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing, and protection of personal information, including, for example, laws related to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure members of our workforce are aware of our program and the role they play in protecting this data. Our privacy statements provide notice of our privacy practices, and provide the opportunity for impacted parties to exercise their rights with respect to their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security. We use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that is given to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We use technical and procedural measures designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of data. Whenever sensitive information, such as credit card information or tax return data, is transmitted to us through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products, as well as internally developed technology, security procedures, and practices.GOVERNMENT REGULATIONWe are subject to federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations that add compliance costs, affect how we operate, and may impact our ability to compete. For example, our Consumer and ProTax segments are subject to federal, state, and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Global Business Solutions segment offers products and services to small and mid-market businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, financing for small and mid-market businesses, and other financial service offerings, which are also subject to certain regulatory 10 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsrequirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. For additional information regarding the government regulations to which we are subject, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risks under “Legal and Compliance Risks.” INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends on the proprietary technology integrated into our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology through a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights, and trademarks and service marks to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit’s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.While our portfolio of patents is growing, our issued patents could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may continue to assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert resources and management attention. Additionally, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.HUMAN CAPITALWe consider our employees to be one of our four key True North stakeholders because they are critical to delivering for our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2025, we had approximately 18,200 employees in seven countries. During fiscal 2025, we employed on average approximately 12,300 seasonal employees from January to April primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business. Intuit’s Chief People & Places Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, manages our overall workforce policies and strategies, including employee recruitment, workplace environment and culture, engagement and retention, leadership development, succession planning, organization and talent assessment, fair pay, and executive compensation. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of these programs.Culture and ValuesTo deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create an inclusive, safe, and respectful workplace where employees can do the best work of their lives and be empowered to make an impact, learn and grow, and feel connected.

We provide eligible full-time employees paid time off that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits and for donation matching up to an annual limit.Talent AcquisitionWe have a robust talent acquisition process that begins with cross-functional talent planning to define hiring needs. Candidates are assessed against skills and values as defined by each hiring team. We are an equal opportunity employer and make employment decisions without regard to any basis protected by federal, state, or local law. We do not make  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K11Table of Contentsemployment decisions based on an individual’s identity. To expand our reach for the best available talent, we have invested in external partnerships with organizations and universities. This includes active participation and having a significant presence at prominent industry conferences and events known for attracting global audiences with varied skills and experience.Talent Development and Retention We strive to create an inclusive, safe, and respectful environment that enables our employees to do the best work of their lives. We provide resources that help them make a positive impact, continue to learn, grow professionally, and feel connected to our culture. We promote the development of all of our employees and provide them with access to learning and training based on their needs and interests and the resources they need to grow, thrive, and reinvent themselves over time. We offer learning programs throughout the employee lifecycle, beginning with onboarding and continuing with ongoing career growth programs. We focus on internal mobility, helping our people acquire new skills, take on new responsibilities, and gain new experiences. This approach contributes to our success in serving our customers while helping our employees achieve their individual professional development and other career goals.We are also invested in growing the capabilities of our managers and developing the leadership skills of our executives. Our teams design programs and resources, such as the Intuit Leadership Playbook, focused on leading with a clear vision, building a high-performance culture, and driving winning results for all of our stakeholders.All full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through company-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from AI to accelerating velocity, in support of an employee’s ability to adapt to any work environment.Employees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during performance assessment conversations and ongoing regular check-ins with their manager.Employee Engagement and ListeningListening and responding to our employees is at the core of our culture. We value employee feedback and leverage it to continuously improve the employee experience. We regularly collect, analyze, measure, and share insights about the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including surveys, town halls with senior leadership, and other touchpoints, which help to guide the work we do to support our employees.Total Rewards     Our compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit’s total target compensation includes base pay, a range of incentive plans that vary based on role, and stock-based awards — all set at market-competitive levels. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, including close alignment with Company performance that rewards top performers. Most employees are eligible for stock-based awards, allowing the majority of our employees to share in the Company’s success.We also offer eligible employees a broad range of competitive benefit programs and services designed to address the physical and mental health, well-being, income protection, and family care needs of employees and their family members. These programs include health care, mental health coaching and counseling, programs to save for retirement, tuition assistance, financial counseling, life and family support programs, and paid time off, including annual paid recharge days and family and parental leave.We have a strong culture of transparency, which includes our ongoing focus on fair pay. We are committed to providing fair pay to all of our employees. We regularly examine our performance evaluation practices, including improving practices to ensure equal opportunity for high-performing employees to be promoted.Stronger TogetherAt the foundation of our culture is our Stronger Together value. It guides our behavior and interactions in everything we do and in how we treat one another. We serve diverse customers around the world. We believe we can solve their toughest problems and deliver unrivaled benefits when our workforce understands and reflects our customers. Intuit has established employee resource groups (ERGs) that provide a foundation for a culture of inclusion. These ERGs are employee-driven, volunteer-led, and open to all employees. ERGs offer a sense of community and give all employees the chance to learn from role models, peers, and experts, and to volunteer within their communities, all while aligning with our organization’s overall vision. 12 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERSThe following table shows Intuit’s executive officers and their areas of responsibility as of August 1, 2025.

Below, we describe material factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic, operational, legal and compliance, and financial risks, and which you should consider carefully in evaluating our business. The following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, reputation and credit rating, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the factors, events, and uncertainties discussed below may have occurred in the past. However, these disclosures are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events, or uncertainties have occurred in the past, instead they reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. We could also be affected by other events, factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business. These risks may be amplified by the effects of global developments and conditions or events, including macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which have caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.STRATEGIC RISKSWe face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.We face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging start-ups. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and partners, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. In addition, we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer user bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses, tax and personal financial management customers.We also face competition from companies with a variety of business models and monetization strategies, including increased competition from providers of free and low cost offerings, particularly in our tax, accounting, payments and consumer finance platform businesses. We have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract and retain customers as effectively as our competitors with different business models. In addition, other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for our products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.Our consumer tax business also faces significant, increasing competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities implementing revenue-raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense. These or similar programs have been and may continue to be introduced or expanded in the future, which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue. For example, the IRS made available a free direct filing system and has stated it will explore ways to expand eligibility for the program, including partnering with more states. Additionally, the legacy IRS Free File Program enables the IRS to offer free commercial tax software directly to qualifying taxpayers, and taxpayer adoption of this program could expand with increased awareness of and government support for the program.Through these or other programs, federal and state governments are or could become publicly funded direct competitors of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit. Government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications on us.Future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully extend our platform, introduce new and enhanced products, features, services and business models.We operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. To meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers and partners and attract and retain top technical talent, we must continue to innovate, develop and extend our platform, introduce new products, services, and features, and enhance our ability to anticipate and solve new and existing customer problems, including with emerging technologies, such as AI. If we are not able to do this successfully, we may face a competitive disadvantage and our business could be harmed. We have and will continue to devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, including AI. There can be no assurance that we or our customers will realize the expected benefits from these investments. Legislation or regulatory changes in these areas may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users and hinder our ability to leverage emerging technologies and build out our platform capabilities.  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K15Table of ContentsOur consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services. They include customers who use our free consumer tax products and whose tax scenarios evolve in subsequent years to require paid services. Encouraging continued use of our offerings in successive years can become increasingly difficult if customers do not perceive our offerings to provide continuing or meaningfully incremental value. The growth of our business depends, in part, on our ability to successfully provide customers value in this way. In addition, when customers consent to the use of their data across our platform, we work to provide additional benefits to them through our existing offerings and through the development of new offerings. Our inability to demonstrate value of any of these offerings to existing customers may negatively impact our ability to build new data-driven offerings and our revenue. We may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new offerings in the past. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new offerings may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. We have also invested, and in the future, expect to invest in new business models, technologies, geographies, strategies and initiatives. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including a rapidly changing regulatory environment, diversion of management’s attention from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives, inadequate return on investments, and social or ethical scrutiny. Because these new initiatives are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition, operating results, or reputation.We rely on intellectual property in our products and services.Many of our products and services utilize our own intellectual property, as well as the intellectual property of third parties, which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. We may not be able to obtain licenses to these third-party technologies or content on reasonable terms, or at all, in the future. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use certain intellectual property in our products and services, we may not be able to provide the affected offerings, and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted, which may in turn harm our future financial results, damage our brand, and result in customer loss. Also, we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third-party intellectual property incorporated in our offerings, including through our use of AI. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted against us, it could require us to pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, require us to change our products, technology, or business practices, or require our compliance with other unfavorable contractual terms. Even if we are not ultimately liable for any potential infringement, pending claims require us to use significant resources, require management attention and could result in loss of customers.Some of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under “open source” licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software. Our established internal review and approval processes may not mitigate these risks, and we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. Our inability to mitigate the risks associated with the usage of open source software may harm our business.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions. However, the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights, including through litigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs, may not always be sufficient or effective. We often observe unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces, and despite our effort to implement technical countermeasures, we expect piracy to continue to remain a persistent problem that results in lost revenue and increased expenses. In addition, there is uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights that may result from our use of GenAI. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand, and our ability to compete.Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands and platform strategy is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers and expanding our business with existing customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events, activities, or views attributed to us, members of our workforce or Board of Directors, agents, third parties we rely on, or our users, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Perceived social harm or unfairness of outcomes relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. Our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services, as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations. In addition, a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products or 16 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsservices and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price.Our efforts related to environment, social, and governance matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.Environmental, social and governance matters continue to be an area of focus for shareholders, regulators, customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Our efforts and reporting on these matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations, and performance. This could happen if we fail, or are perceived to fail, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations or varying state or federal regulatory requirements, or to uphold or achieve our public commitments. Standards and best practices for tracking and reporting these matters continue to evolve and we may not be able to implement new and changing standards and best practices in ways that meet the varied expectations of all of our stakeholders. Any of the foregoing may also expose us to increased scrutiny from stakeholders and negatively impact demand for our products, our ability to attract and retain talent or our relationships with customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. Our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction, both in and outside the United States. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:•inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;•inability to realize synergies or anticipated benefits within the expected time frame or at all;•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;•challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;•the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements, and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify;•unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, security policies, standards, and practices, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;•failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets; •risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and•to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly, and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted.We have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:•inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;•failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;•requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;•the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;•challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property, systems and data to be divested from the intellectual property, systems and data that we wish to retain;•inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business; •challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture; •disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; •loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture; and•if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, or the new owners do not handle the customer data with the same level of care, our other businesses may be adversely affected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K17Table of ContentsIn addition, any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied. Evolving regulatory expectations and changes in the political environment may make it more challenging to obtain any required regulatory approval. Because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. In particular, if we are unable to successfully operate together with any company that we acquire to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame or at all, there may be a material and adverse effect on the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition, and we could experience additional costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, adverse changes in market conditions and other factors, including those listed above, may cause an acquisition to be dilutive to Intuit’s operating earnings per share for a period of time. Any dilution of our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Intuit Common Stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.We host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data, including credit card information, tax return information, bank account numbers, credit report information, login credentials and passwords, personal and business financial data, transaction records, social security numbers and payroll information, as well as our confidential, nonpublic business information. The significant resources we expend to implement security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security incidents cannot provide absolute security.Our technologies, systems, and networks have been subject to, and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, worms, social engineering, malicious software programs, insider threats, denial-of-service attacks and other cybersecurity threats that have in the past, and could in the future, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and our workforce, or Intuit's sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our data, software, and systems. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by malicious third parties, acting alone or in groups, or more sophisticated organizations, including nation-states or state-sponsored organizations, and the risks could be elevated in connection with significant armed conflicts, acts of war or terrorism. Customers who fail to update their systems, continue to run software that we no longer support, fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks. Further, we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products, and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks. In addition, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and, as technologies like AI develop rapidly, malicious third parties are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against. We have been and may in the future be a more frequent target of cyberattacks because cyber-criminals tend to focus their efforts on well-known offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive personal or financial information.Further, the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data. Malicious third parties have in the past, and may in the future, be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce, customers, vendors, partners, or users by social engineering means, such as email phishing, to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or our workforce. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. Unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software. Inadvertent exposure of data or access to our systems may also be caused by members of our workforce, including by their error or use of AI.Criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data. We have experienced such instances in the past and as the broader accessibility of stolen identity information increases, we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or our workforce in the future. Further, our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products. Such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third-party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products, which could result in disclosure of confidential information. In addition, our hybrid workplace model, where our workforce spends a portion of their time working away from our offices, increases the potential for attacks and adds operational complexity that exacerbates our security-related risks.Further, because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple Intuit products, a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information. The existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity, even if they do not result in a security breach, may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings. Such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand and limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to 18 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsdecline. In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which could exacerbate the risk of a security incident and the related effects on our businesses.While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in disclosure of confidential information, loss of customer confidence in our products, possible litigation, material harm to our reputation and financial condition, disruption of our or our customers’ business operations, and a decline in our stock price.Additionally, our use of Credit Karma member data is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that, among other things, requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biennial independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order. Our failure to fulfill the requirements of the FTC’s order could result in fines, penalties, enforcement inquiries, investigations and claims, and negatively impact our business and reputation.A cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation. We depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners who are critical to our business. We or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits, or to host certain of our and our customers' sensitive and personal data. In addition, we share sensitive, nonpublic business information (including, for example, materials relating to financial, business and legal strategies) with other vendors in the ordinary course of business.It is possible that malicious third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls, resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data, despite our efforts to conduct background checks of our workforce, conduct reviews of partners, developers, and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data. Further, while we conduct due diligence on the security and business controls of our third-party partners, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures. Malicious third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data. In addition, malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by, for example, introducing malware through software updates. This risk is exacerbated with the advancement of technologies like AI, which malicious third parties are using to create new, sophisticated and more frequent attacks on our third-party partners. A security incident involving third parties we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data, or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data; make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity; cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems; result in possible litigation, fines, penalties and damages; result in loss of customer confidence; cause material harm to our reputation and brands; lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies; result in an adverse financial condition; and result in a reduced stock price.Concerns about the broader cybersecurity environment could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation.The continued occurrence of cybersecurity incidents affecting governments, businesses, and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cybersecurity incidents are increasingly more common and frequent. If the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data. Additionally, political uncertainty and military actions may subject us and our service providers to heightened risks of security incidents. In addition, the increased availability of data obtained as a result of cybersecurity incidents affecting third-party offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity. Even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents, any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.If we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, we may suffer losses, which may be substantial, and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.Many of the industries in which we operate have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated, including through the use of AI. We have been and may from time to time become targeted by such malicious third parties engaging in fraudulent activities. Any such fraudulent activities may adversely impact our business, and the risk is heightened when our workforce is working away from our offices under our hybrid work model. In addition to any losses that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. If we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity, governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer the affected services, or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted, which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically, resulting  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K19Table of Contentsin a significant adverse impact on our business, earnings, and revenue. As fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated, our fraud detection and prevention measures, and the teams that create and maintain them, must become correspondingly more sophisticated to combat them across the various industries in which we operate. Accordingly, we have implemented and may continue to implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products. These control mechanisms could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings.If we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our business may be harmed.Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our money and personal financial management businesses. It is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately. The likelihood of any such error or misappropriation is magnified as we increase the volume and speed of the transactions we process. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, or if there is an error in our products, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. In our payments processing service business, if a disputed transaction between a merchant and its customer is not resolved in favor of the merchant, we may be required to pay those amounts to the payment or credit card network and these payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves established to make such payments.Business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party Internet-based or cloud computing services. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. We have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers. If any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason, our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.Failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities, all of which may cause a loss in customers, refunds of product fees, material harm to our reputation and operating results.Our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods. We face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we have historically derived a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses. Any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, particularly during a peak period, could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, unexpected refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.We rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors, and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities are costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.Our business operations, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, effects of climate change, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malware, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. For example, we operate under a hybrid workplace model where our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working away from our offices. This model has introduced risks of disruptions to our operations, which may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support our products and services.In addition, since our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults, our recovery in the event of a major earthquake or other catastrophic event may require us to expend significant time and resources and may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Further, the adverse effects of any such adverse event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed.20 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.We rely on our network infrastructure, data hosting, public cloud, and software-as-a-service providers, and internal technology systems for many of our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. We are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages, defects or other performance problems, and may not be able to deliver certain offerings or develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly, and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue, or damage to our reputation.If we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third-party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected.Our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, manage and maintain new and existing relationships with third-party partners. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, platforms, suppliers, credit reporting bureaus, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, accountants, contractors, financial institutions, core processors, licensing partners and development partners, among others, in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business. Credit Karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institutions and other partners, which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on Credit Karma's platform, such as adverse economic conditions, evolving limitations on their capacity to offer products on the platform, the introduction of competing products on their platforms, and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment. We also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. In certain instances, these third-party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party’s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third-party contractors engaged to help us operate our business.In particular, we have relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers. If macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services, impose new or higher costs for certain services, or institute cost-cutting efforts, or give rise to speculation relating to such events, it may be more difficult to offer, if at all, those services to our customers, in which case our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if one of the counterparty financial institutions with whom we have significant deposits were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover our assets from such counterparty may be limited, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.Additionally, the business operations of our third-party partners and the third-party partners who support them have been and could continue to be disrupted, including as a result of major technical outages, uncertain macroeconomic conditions, such as trade wars, and global health crises, such as pandemics and endemics. If our third-party partners are unable to help us operate our business or prevent us from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders, our business and financial results may be negatively impacted. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies or to update their products, services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.As we cannot control the day-to-day practices of our suppliers and business partners, we cannot ensure their compliance with the law and our policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data use and security, environmental compliance, intellectual property licensing, and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements. Any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation.We increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store for the distribution of certain of our offerings, benefiting from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers. However, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers. Any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.Competition for our key employees is intense and we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our strategic objectives.Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees, including members of our executive team and individuals in technical and other key positions. Experienced individuals with expertise in software as a  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K21Table of Contentsservice, financial technology, mobile technologies, data science, AI, and cybersecurity are in high demand. We have faced and will continue to face intense competition globally to attract and retain a diverse workforce with these and other skills that are critical to our success. This is especially the case in California and India where a significant number of our employees are located. In cases where existing employees cannot be effectively developed to meet evolving business needs, our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent becomes even more important. The compensation and incentives we have available to attract, retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees as the competition for talent intensifies. For example, our equity awards may become less effective if our stock price decreases or increases at a slower rate than our talent competitors. In addition, our ability to issue significant additional equity to attract or retain employees may be limited by the risks of dilution to our existing stockholders and the related increase in our expenses. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain and recruit senior management and highly-skilled employees that may not be offset by improved productivity or revenue. Other factors may make it more challenging for us to continue to successfully attract, retain and develop key employees. Uncertainty in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our platform and products and by our customers may result in harm to our business and reputation. We continue to build and invest in systems and tools that incorporate AI technologies, including GenAI for customers, experts, and our workforce. We also use third parties to support this work. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, uncertainties, and challenges that could adversely impact our business. The development, adoption, and use for GenAI technologies are still in their early stages, and ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Intuit or third-party developers or vendors could result in unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms that we use may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient. In addition, any latency, disruption, or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our offerings. Developing, testing, and deploying resource-intensive AI systems may require additional investment and increase our costs. There also may be real or perceived social harm, unfairness, or other outcomes that undermine public confidence in the use and deployment of AI. In addition, third parties may deploy AI technologies in a manner that reduces customer demand for our products and services. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products or harm to our business, results of operations or reputation. The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. In addition, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to our use, development, and deployment of AI. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations, or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm.If we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.Our customers rely on the accuracy of our offerings. All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable, ambiguous, and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products have in the past, and may contain in the future unexpected errors that could interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations. The complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features, functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect. When we encounter problems, we may be required to modify our code, work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers, assist customers with amendments, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release, it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed. Any major defects, launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or other payments, including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products. For example, an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers, including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability. While our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products, such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed. This could also affect our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. Further, as we develop our platform to connect people to experts, such as connecting TurboTax customers with tax experts through our TurboTax Live offering, or connecting QuickBooks customers with bookkeepers through our QuickBooks Live offering, we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous, ineffective or otherwise unsuitable. Any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers, a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results. Moreover, as we continue to incorporate emerging technologies, like AI, into our offerings, they may not function as designed 22 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsor have unintended consequences, any of which could subject us to new or enhanced competitive harm, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny or reputational harm.Our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•different or more restrictive privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products, services and operations, such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•geopolitical events and dynamics, including natural disasters or severe weather events (including those caused or exacerbated by climate change), acts of war and terrorism (including any conflicts in the Middle East) and any related military, political or economic responses, and public health emergencies, including divergent governmental responses thereto affecting the jurisdictions in which we operate or maintain a workforce or facilities;•compliance with sanctions and import or export regulations, including those arising from the Russia-Ukraine war;•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments;•economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;•changes in trade policies and regulations, including the threat or imposition of protective trade measures, such as tariffs or other trade restrictions, as well as any retaliatory actions;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.Violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions or sanctions against us, our officers or our broader workforce, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Our policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws cannot ensure that our workforce, contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.Climate change may have an impact on our business.Our environmental programs and efforts to partner with organizations that are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks may not be sufficient to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change. Additionally, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary workplace locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, extreme wind, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work away from our offices. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. We also expect to face increasing regulatory requirements and regulatory scrutiny related to climate matters, resulting in higher associated compliance costs. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K23Table of ContentsLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSIncreasing and changing regulation of our businesses may adversely affect our ability to operate or harm our operating results.We are subject to an increasing number of local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and rules and standards. These relate to, without limitation, labor, advertising and marketing, tax, financial services, AI, data privacy and security, electronic funds transfer, money transmission, lending, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, insurance, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, antitrust and competition, environmental, health and safety, and other regulated activities. The legal and regulatory environment in which we operate is complex, varies across jurisdictions and is subject to frequent change and evolving interpretations. New or amended laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, policies, and enforcement priorities may also be introduced. These dynamics affect our business. As we expand our offerings and evolve our business models, we have, and may in the future, become subject to additional regulatory requirements and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Our ability to adopt emerging technologies, including AI, and to innovate for our customers and operate our business may be harmed by the uncertainty and complexity created by the evolving legal and regulatory environment. For example, in February 2025, the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) went into force regulating AI systems that affect individuals located in the EU. Additionally, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI and/or enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, including Utah, Colorado, and California. Compliance with these laws, and similar emerging laws, may add significant costs to our business and may require us to change certain business practices to comply. In addition, some of our offerings, such as our lending and payments products, require licenses to operate. Our inability to obtain or maintain a license, or to comply with current or new license requirements, may materially harm our ability to operate in specific jurisdictions or subject us to regulatory fines or penalties.The tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.Any perceived or actual failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and rules, could negatively impact our reputation, expose us to legal liability, fines, penalties, or require us to change our offerings or business operations. In addition, evolving laws, regulations, and rules may require us to modify our business practices or compliance programs in order to continue operating our businesses. Regulatory or legislative changes and other actions that materially affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice, and we may be unable to respond quickly. As a result, we may face increased operating costs, reduced revenue opportunities, and may be unable to mitigate some or all of the adverse impacts those changes may cause. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our ability to operate and may harm our results of operations.Complex and evolving privacy and data protection regulations or changing customer expectations could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity, the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data, and the use of AI are evolving. Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the collection, use, and retention of personal information by our offerings in the EU. In addition, in the absence of a unified federal privacy standard, a growing number of U.S. states have enacted or introduced data privacy laws and regulations. Several countries have established specific legal requirements for cross-border data transfers and governmental authorities and privacy advocates around the world continue to propose new regulatory actions concerning data protection. Moreover, several jurisdictions are considering regulatory frameworks for AI that implicate data protection laws. In our efforts to meet the various data privacy regulations that apply to us, we have made and continue to make certain changes to our offerings, business practices, and use of certain third party tools and vendors. Additionally, customer sensitivity to privacy continues to increase and our privacy statements and practices may create additional customer expectations about the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. In addition, the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity. For example, the judicial invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor frameworks that we relied on to transfer data created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S. While a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework currently provides a basis for us to transfer personal data from the European Union the U.S., the future of this framework is uncertain because it faces legal challenges in the European courts.24 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsEach of these privacy, security and data protection requirements could impose significant limitations on us, require changes to our business practices, require notification to customers, workers, and others of a security incident, restrict our use or storage of personal information, limit our use of third-party tools and vendors, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations, or failure to meet customer expectations could result in negative publicity or harm to our reputation and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.We are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.We are subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional proceedings, claims and inquiries may arise in the future. The number and significance of these proceedings, claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business; require us to change our business practices or products; require significant amounts of management time; result in diversion of significant operations resources; or otherwise harm our business and future financial results. For further information about specific litigation, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.We may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. We have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties. Some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers. These claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims made against us may harm our business.We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.The laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges, and there has been an increasing demand for repealing or limiting the protections afforded by these laws through either judicial decision or legislation. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct and may further give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. Certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services. Claims of intellectual property infringement, defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content, even if that content is not generated by us. Any claims, meritorious or not, may lead to business disruption and costs incurred as a result of this potential liability, which may harm our business.FINANCIAL RISKSThe results of operations of our tax business may fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality of the business and other factors beyond our control.Our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. Revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from November through April, as the tax filing deadline for the IRS and many states is traditionally in April. This seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. In addition, unanticipated changes to federal and state tax filing deadlines may further exacerbate the impact of the seasonality.Our financial results from our tax offerings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of other factors, some of which may affect the timing of revenue recognition. These include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive or process electronic tax return submissions or  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K25Table of Contentsissue refunds; changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services; changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix; changes in customer behavior; and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings. Other factors, including unanticipated changes to the tax code or the administration of government programs and payments by tax authorities, may cause variations from year to year in the number of tax filers. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact the number of tax returns we prepare and file and the operating results of our tax business. Other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. Any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.If actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved, our future financial results may be harmed.Like many software companies, we refund customers for product returns and subscription and service cancellations. We establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds. We closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved, it may result in lower net revenue.Unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results.Our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in our stock price, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Foreign governments may enact tax laws, including in response to guidelines issued by international organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.An increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in material tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.Adverse global macroeconomic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.Adverse macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, such as volatility or distress in the financial markets, recession or inflationary pressures, slowing growth, rising interest rates, rising unemployment, rising consumer debt levels, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, government shutdowns and austerity programs could negatively affect our business and financial condition. These macroeconomic conditions or global events, such as political instability, sanctions, and war, have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, decreases in consumer and small business spending and other unforeseen consequences. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on our partners, customers, members, or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Additionally, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to liquidity challenges and further instability in the financial markets, which may in turn cause third parties, including customers, to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements. Moreover, because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our offerings, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing offerings. Some financial institutions and other partners have in the past decreased or suspended their activity on Credit Karma’s platform and could do so in the future. In addition, increased interest rates may make offers from Credit Karma’s partners less attractive to Credit Karma's members. Members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted, reducing members' ability to qualify for credit cards and loans. Decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce payment processing volumes, causing reductions in our payments revenue. High unemployment and changes in the tax code and the government programs that are administered by tax authorities have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in our end-user markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Adverse economic conditions may also increase the costs of operating our business, including vendor, supplier and workforce expenses. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity positions. Such conditions may also 26 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsexpose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and negatively impact our future financial results.We provide access to capital to small and mid-market businesses, which exposes us to risk, and may cause us material financial or reputational harm.We provide qualified small and mid-market businesses with access to capital from third-party lenders and then we purchase some or all of those loans from the lender. This activity exposes us to the risk of the borrowers’ inability to repay such loans. We have entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions as a source of funding to purchase some or all of the loans. Any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to these businesses. Further, the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting, scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of the borrowers, or may be otherwise ineffective, resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans. It is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information. Moreover, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation and rising interest rates, have impacted and may continue to impact these businesses, which are disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns, and may increase the likelihood that the borrowers are unable to repay their loans. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our reputation, relationships with borrowers, collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed.Amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income.Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill. We may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets, may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results. We have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.We have indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional short-term and long-term debt in the future. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions; and•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital, operating or investment expenditures. Such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt.Additionally, the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants. For example, our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens on our and subsidiaries’ assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders, as applicable, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.Under the terms of our 2020 Notes, we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes. The repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase. In addition, adverse economic conditions or any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, if at all. For further information about our indebtedness, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K27Table of ContentsWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.We have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Also, the amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.Our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.Our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or legal proceedings can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, including the effects of a general slowdown in the global economy, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism, and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may cause volatility in our stock price. Moreover, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, and significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism have caused, and in the future may cause, increased volatility in the global financial markets and, in turn, our stock price. Further, any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.28 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C - CYBERSECURITYRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGYWe host, collect, process, use, and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data across an array of our own and third-party information systems. To help protect these systems and data, we have implemented a robust information security program that includes numerous administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. We strive to evolve our cyber defenses to help minimize impacts from cyber threats. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach. This approach focuses on protecting business operations and preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data by preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats, as well as effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. Our information security program includes:•Having designated information security personnel, led by our Chief Information Security and Fraud Prevention Officer (CISO), who has decades of relevant experience and also serves as Chief Information Officer. The CISO is supported primarily by our Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk, and Fraud Team (CyberCRAFT), which consists of approximately 500 professionals as of July 31, 2025. In addition to bringing their current expertise to their roles, CyberCRAFT professionals have the ability to participate in our specialized training and development programs to further enhance their cybersecurity skill sets and cross-train on related capabilities. The CISO works closely with the Company’s internal legal team to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements;•Risk assessments designed to help identify and prioritize significant cybersecurity risks. Our process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats includes incorporation of an internally developed threat catalog and our tracking of trends for areas such as vulnerability management, our leverage of technical standards and guidance, input from our participation and collaboration with law enforcement and government initiatives, and our internal and vendor-supported threat intelligence initiatives. The cybersecurity risk assessment operates alongside our broader overall enterprise-wide risk assessment and management process, and key cybersecurity risks are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee in a manner that helps frame cybersecurity risks as part of a broader risk context;•Regular testing and assessments of our systems and controls to evaluate the information security program maturity and effectiveness using cybersecurity frameworks (such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and SOC 2) and to identify and address potential vulnerabilities—and as appropriate, we adjust our policies, standards, and processes based on testing and assessment results;•A vulnerability management program to determine the in-scope systems, patch systems based on criticality, and disclose potential vulnerabilities;•A cybersecurity incident response plan and scenario-specific playbooks for responding to various types of cybersecurity incidents;•Business continuity and disaster recovery plans to support more effective response and recovery efforts in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption;•The use of external service providers and consultants to assess or monitor the environment or otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls;•Commercially available and customized security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data;•A security awareness and training program for our employees and contractors, with role-based training for certain personnel and positions; and•A third-party risk management framework designed to monitor and address cybersecurity risks from various third parties (including vendors, service providers, and other contractors) that includes diligence regarding the third party’s cybersecurity capabilities and additional monitoring of certain third parties based on the results of diligence. In addition, we have established standard contractual terms and conditions regarding cybersecurity applicable to third parties, as well as further downstream parties, that may be tailored to the use case and sensitivity of any data or business processes involved.Additionally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance which may cover some or all of the potential losses from a cybersecurity incident. During the last fiscal year, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected Intuit, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we continue to face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks which may materially affect us in the  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K29Table of Contentsfuture. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks is discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risk that “Security incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.”GOVERNANCEManagement is responsible for the day-to-day administration of Intuit’s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices, and risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides primary oversight of cybersecurity risks and the Company’s efforts to mitigate those risks.MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHTAs part of management oversight, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) receives monthly updates from the CISO and representatives from CyberCRAFT. These updates provide a recurring overview of cybersecurity trends and status updates (e.g., security events, fraud detection, IT roadmap progress, follow-up from prior assessments, security awareness exercise results), as well as a more focused analysis on select cybersecurity topics for the month. Examples of prior topics include: recent cybersecurity legislation, cybersecurity incidents affecting external entities, and trends in cybersecurity controls and adoption. As part of our incident response processes, incidents are classified based on the incident’s characteristics. For certain risk-based classifications of incidents, the CEO and other members of the executive leadership team are also informed and contribute as part of our incident response processes. BOARD OVERSIGHTOur full Board of Directors provides ultimate oversight for the cybersecurity program, in addition to other significant risks of Intuit. The Board of Directors has delegated primary oversight of cybersecurity risks to the Audit and Risk Committee. On a quarterly basis, the CISO and CyberCRAFT specialists provide the Audit and Risk Committee with updates, metrics, and trends, such as the status of prior security events, existing and emerging threat landscapes, the results of audits or assessments, fraud prevention efforts, vulnerability detection and disclosure changes, and the status of projects to strengthen our security systems and improve incident readiness, and how these may affect broader enterprise risk management. Under our incident response processes’ risk-based escalation protocols, the CISO, or other management, escalates certain incidents to the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, who may then involve the broader committee or the full Board of Directors, as appropriate.

This should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects. Our MD&A includes the following sections:• Executive Overview: High-level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.• Critical Accounting Estimates: Policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.• Results of Operations: A more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses.• Liquidity and Capital Resources: Discussion of key aspects of our consolidated statements of cash flows, changes in our consolidated balance sheets, and our financial commitments.You should note that this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report.In the Results of Operations sections of this MD&A, where we describe two or more factors that contributed to changes in revenue and operating income, we have, where possible, quantified the impact of those factors. Where a change is the result of multiple factors that are interrelated and cannot be separately quantified, we have identified the interrelated factors without quantifying them.In July 2024, our management approved, committed to, and initiated a plan of reorganization (the Plan) focused on reallocating resources to our key growth areas. The Plan included the exit of employees and the closing of real estate sites in certain markets to support growing technology teams and capabilities in strategic locations. The actions associated with the Plan were substantially complete in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Total restructuring costs associated with the Plan were $238 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded charges in connection with the Plan of $15 million and $223 million, respectively. These charges are primarily related to severance and employee benefits and are recorded to restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the all-in-one platform that customers use to grow and run their business.On August 1, 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions in our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at the corporate level rather than at the segment level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we reclassified $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion from Global Business Solutions, $573 million and $475 million from Consumer, and $33 million and $34 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively, to conform to the current presentation. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Consistent with our vision to deliver one consumer platform, effective August 1, 2025, we combined the Consumer, Credit Karma, and ProTax businesses into a single Consumer business. We will reflect this new organization in our fiscal 2026 segment reporting.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWThis overview provides a high-level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2025, as well as our future prospects.

Disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems, and mega-platforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights, and increase speed of service. These shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase.SeasonalityOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.Key Challenges and RisksOur growth strategy depends upon our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce emerging technologies, including AI and GenAI, to drive broad adoption of our products and services and enter new markets. Our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Much of our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and develop highly skilled employees, including those in technical and leadership roles who are critical to our strategic growth, in a highly competitive talent environment.As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.We operate in industries that are experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated, including through the use of AI. We implement additional security measures, and we continue to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious activity. We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.Our operations are impacted by a rapidly-evolving regulatory environment and face increasingly heightened scrutiny. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a broad and increasing range of subjects, both in the United States (U.S.) and internationally. For a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.34 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsOverview of Financial ResultsThe most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; operating income growth for the company as a whole; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. We also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. Service offerings are a significant part of our business. Our total service revenue was $16.4 billion, or 87% of our total revenue in fiscal 2025, and we expect our total service revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to grow over the long term.Key highlights for fiscal 2025 include the following:Revenue ofGlobal Business Solutions revenue ofConsumer revenue of$18.8 B$11.1 B$4.9 Bup 16% from fiscal 2024up 16% from fiscal 2024up 10% from fiscal 2024Credit Karma revenue of ProTax revenue ofOperating income of$2.3 B$621 M$4.9 Bup 32% from fiscal 2024up 4% from fiscal 2024up 36% from fiscal 2024Net income ofDiluted net income per share ofCash flow from operations of$3.9 B$13.67$6.2 Bup 31% from fiscal 2024up 31% from fiscal 2024up 27% from fiscal 2024CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a material impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss, and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimations and uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates: •Revenue Recognition•Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets – Impairment Assessments•Legal Contingencies•Accounting for Income Taxes – Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax PositionsOur senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K35Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing services, delivery of qualified links, marketing automation, live expert advice, financing for small and mid-market businesses, and desktop software products, desktop software subscriptions, and financial supplies. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services, which are primarily recognized ratably over the relevant period or when the customer consumes the related service. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. The primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct. If any of these judgments were to change, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. For additional information, see “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets – Impairment AssessmentsWe estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.As described in “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.We estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. In order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of cost, accumulated amortization, and weighted-average life in years for our acquired intangible assets.Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheets.During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,” in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.Legal ContingenciesWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims, and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we 36 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsrecord a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Accounting for Income Taxes – Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax PositionsWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.We record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change.We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 can be found under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on September 4, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at investors.intuit.com.Financial Overview(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Fiscal 2025Fiscal 2024Fiscal 20232025-2024% Change2024-2023% ChangeTotal net revenue$18,831 $16,285 $14,368 16%13%Operating income4,923 3,630 3,141 36%16%Net income3,869 2,963 2,384 31%24%Diluted net income per share$13.67 $10.43 $8.42 31%24%Total net revenue increased $2.5 billion, or 16%, in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024. Global Business Solutions segment revenue increased 16% due to growth in our Online Ecosystem revenue. Credit Karma revenue increased 32% due to strength in our personal loan, credit card, and auto insurance verticals. Consumer segment revenue increased 10% due to growth in our higher-priced and additional service offerings, such as TurboTax Live and our early tax refund offerings. See “Segment Results” later in this Item 7 for more information.Operating income increased $1.3 billion, or 36%, in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024. The increase in operating income was due to the increase in revenue described above partially offset by an increase in expenses. Expenses increased due to increases in marketing, staffing, outside services, and sales-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expenses. See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 7 for more information. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our restructuring charges.Net income increased $906 million, or 31%, in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024. The increase in net income was due to the increase in operating income described above, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. The increase in income tax expense is due to the increase in operating income described above and a decrease in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted net income per share increased 31% to $13.67 for fiscal 2025, in line with the increase in net income.Segment ResultsThe information below is organized in accordance with our four reportable segments. All of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the U.S. Total international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the all-in-one platform that customers use to grow and run their business. On August 1, 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions in our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at the corporate level rather than at the segment level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we reclassified $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion from Global Business Solutions, $573 million and $475 million from Consumer, and $33 million and $34 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively, to conform to the current presentation.Segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, general and administrative, and non-employment related legal and litigation settlement costs, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. As part of our platform strategy, we also include customer success and product development for our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments in unallocated corporate items as we do not allocate these expenses to the segments because they are managed at the platform level. Customer success includes the costs of tax and bookkeeping experts that support our TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live offerings. For our Credit Karma reportable segment, segment expenses include certain direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, professional fees and transaction charges related to business combinations, and restructuring charges. These unallocated 38 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentscorporate costs for all segments totaled $8.7 billion in fiscal 2025, $8.0 billion in fiscal 2024, and $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Unallocated corporate items increased in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024 due to increases in cost of service revenue, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs.

The increase in total operating expenses was due to increases of $410 million for marketing expenses, $300 million for staffing expenses, $161 million for outside services, and $52 million for sales-related expenses, partially offset by a $208 million decrease in restructuring charges. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding restructuring charges.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest ExpenseInterest expense of $247 million in fiscal 2025 consisted of interest on our senior unsecured notes, unsecured revolving credit facility, and commercial paper program.

The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.(3) During fiscal 2025, we recorded $51 million in net losses on long-term investments.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was approximately 20%. Excluding certain tax benefits primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate was approximately 24%. This rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was approximately 17%. Excluding certain tax benefits primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate was approximately 24%. This rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.At July 31, 2025, we had net deferred tax assets of $1.2 billion, which included a valuation allowance for California net deferred tax assets primarily related to state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards. We have also provided a valuation allowance on other non-California state operating loss and foreign operating loss carryforwards. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” earlier in this Item 7 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. On July 4, 2025, the U.S. federal government enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which includes significant tax changes, most notably the reinstatement of the immediate expensing of domestic research and developmental expenditures, effective in fiscal 2026. The deductibility of these expenditures is expected to significantly reduce our deferred tax assets and income tax payable for periods starting in fiscal 2026.The OBBBA has multiple effective dates from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2027. The provisions effective during fiscal 2025 did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2025 consolidated financial statements. We are currently assessing all applicable provisions of the legislation and their impact on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2026 and beyond.In 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced Pillar Two Model Rules, which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The currently enacted Pillar Two Model Rules did not have any impact on our provision for income taxes and are not expected to have any significant impact on future years’ provisions for income taxes. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions on our results of operations and cash flows for future years.In the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.46 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOverviewAt July 31, 2025, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $478 million from July 31, 2024, driven by cash from operations partially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities. See the discussion of all factors described in “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which primarily includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, the issuance of senior unsecured notes and commercial paper, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, acquisitions of businesses, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, debt service costs and debt repayment, capital projects, and funding of our financing for small and mid-market businesses and early tax refund offerings. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:(Dollars in millions)July 31,2025July 31,2024$Change%ChangeCash, cash equivalents, and investments$4,552 $4,074 $478 12 %Long-term investments94 131 (37)(28)%Short-term debt— 499 (499)(100)%Long-term debt5,973 5,539 434 8 %Working capital3,737 2,187 1,550 71 %Ratio of current assets to current liabilities1.4 : 11.3 : 1We have historically generated significant cash from operations, and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2026. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.6 billion at July 31, 2025. None of those funds were restricted, and approximately 91% of those funds were located in the U.S.Our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program are available to us for general corporate purposes. At July 31, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility or the commercial paper program. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Our secured revolving credit facilities are available to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small and mid-market businesses. At July 31, 2025, $1.0 billion was outstanding under our secured revolving credit facilities.Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and commercial paper program, and access to external financing will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these types of opportunities. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K47Table of ContentsStatements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023.

Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends on Common StockAs described in Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2025, we had authorization from our Board of Directors for up to $2.1 billion in stock repurchases. On August 19, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization under the existing stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $3.2 billion of our common stock. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.We have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal 2025, we declared cash dividends that totaled $4.16 per share of outstanding common stock, or approximately $1.2 billion. In August 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.20 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 17, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2025. We currently expect to continue to pay comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Commitments for Senior Unsecured NotesIn June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $1.0 billion is outstanding as of July 31, 2025, and is comprised of the following:•$500 million of 1.350% notes due July 2027; and•$500 million of 1.650% notes due July 2030 (together, the 2020 Notes).48 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsInterest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. At July 31, 2025, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $55 million for the remaining duration of the outstanding 2020 Notes.The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the 2020 Notes, we will be required to repurchase the 2020 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2020 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2020 Notes. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.In September 2023, we issued $4 billion of senior unsecured notes comprised of the following:•$750 million of 5.250% notes due September 2026;•$750 million of 5.125% notes due September 2028;•$1,250 million of 5.200% notes due September 2033; and•$1,250 million of 5.500% notes due September 2053 (together, the 2023 Notes).Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year.

The indenture governing the 2023 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2023 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2023 Notes. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Credit FacilitiesUnsecured Revolving Credit FacilitiesOn February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility), and entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility).Under the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $1 billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by one year. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $500 million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $250 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the 2024 Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. The facility fee ranges from 0.050% to 0.125% per annum. The actual interest margins and the facility fee are based on our senior debt credit ratings.The 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

At July 31, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility.On January 30, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $4.5 billion unsecured short-term revolving credit facility (2025 Credit Facility) to fund a portion of our TurboTax early tax refund offering. We terminated the 2025 Credit Facility on March 3, 2025.Advances under the 2025 Credit Facility accrued interest at rates equal to, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted daily simple SOFR or term SOFR plus a margin of 1.125%. Unused portions of the commitment accrued a fee of 0.10% per annum. Secured Revolving Credit FacilitiesOn February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small and mid-market businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). The 2019 Secured Facility is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. and is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary, which are in excess of the amount outstanding under the 2019 Secured Facility as of July 31, 2025. We have entered into several amendments to this facility. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K49Table of Contentsbenchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted.

The maturities of the commercial paper may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, we temporarily increased the capacity of our commercial paper program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion to support our seasonal working capital needs. As of July 31, 2025, the capacity of the commercial paper program was $1.5 billion. At July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this program.Cash Held by Foreign SubsidiariesOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $4.6 billion at July 31, 2025. Approximately 9% of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. We do not expect to pay incremental U.S. taxes on repatriation. We have recorded income tax expense for Canada, India, and Israel withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested. In the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the U.S., we would pay withholding taxes at that time. 50 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2025.

We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K51Table of ContentsITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET                 RISKInvestment Portfolio and Interest Rate RiskWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States (U.S.) government, securities issued by agencies of the U.S. government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. At July 31, 2025, our cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.6 billion. Total interest income for fiscal 2025 was $175 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2025, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $1 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2025, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $5 million.In June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes (the 2020 Notes). As of July 31, 2025, $1.0 billion of the 2020 Notes remained outstanding and was comprised of the following: $500 million of 1.350% notes due in July 2027 and $500 million of 1.650% notes due in July 2030. We carry the 2020 Notes at face value, less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2020 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2020 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.In September 2023, we issued $4 billion of senior unsecured notes, which was comprised of the following: $750 million of 5.250% notes due in September 2026, $750 million of 5.125% notes due in September 2028, $1,250 million of 5.200% notes due in September 2033, and $1,250 million of 5.500% notes due in September 2053 (together, the 2023 Notes). We carry the 2023 Notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2023 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with the changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2023 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.On February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility), and entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility). We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect the 2024 Credit Facility. Advances under the 2024 Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our secured revolving credit facilities. Advances under the secured revolving credit facilities accrue interest at either SOFR plus 1.1%, SOFR plus 1.15%, or adjusted daily simple SOFR plus 1.25%. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2025, $1.0 billion was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facilities. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Impact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate the revenue, costs, and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds) into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency 52 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contentsfluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not material because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. We believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to be immaterial in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above. As of July 31, 2025 and for the year then ended, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K53Table of ContentsITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)55  Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 202558Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 202559  Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2025 and 202460  Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 202561  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 202562  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements642.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:SchedulePageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts98 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required.54 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Determination of Distinct Performance Obligations in Revenue ContractsDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts with customers that often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. The Company has generally concluded that software licenses and services are separate performance obligations and revenues from software licenses and services are recognized as those products and services are provided.Given the nature of the Company’s product and service offerings, there is complexity in determining whether software licenses and services are considered performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or together. Auditing the Company’s determination of distinct performance obligations related to its various product and service offerings involved complex auditor judgment. In particular, significant judgment was required when assessing whether the promised products and services are separate performance obligations or inputs to a combined performance obligation due to the evaluation of the interdependency or interrelation of the promised products and services within each contract. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K55Table of ContentsHow We Addressed theMatter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s processes, as they relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations. We also obtained an understanding of the Company’s product and service offerings and tested the application of the revenue recognition accounting model to determine distinct performance obligations.Among other audit procedures, we evaluated whether the performance obligations identified by the Company were capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract through review of contracts, discussions with management, observing product demonstrations and review of the Company’s website and other marketing materials. More specifically, we evaluated the Company’s determination of whether the contract was to deliver (1) multiple promised products or services that constitute separate performance obligations or (2) a single performance obligation that is comprised of the combined products or services. That is, considering the utility, integration, interrelation or interdependence of the products and services, we evaluated whether the multiple promised products and services that were delivered to the customer were outputs or inputs to a combined item./s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.San Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 3, 2025 56 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intuit Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of July 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated September 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California September 3, 2025  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K57Table of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit Inc. (Intuit, we, us, or our) is a global financial technology platform with a mission to power prosperity around the world. We help consumers do their taxes with ease and confidence and improve their financial success, from credit building to wealth building, with tax and personal financial management products. We help small and mid-market businesses grow and run their business end-to-end, from lead to cash. This includes financial management - including payments and capital - compliance, human capital management, and marketing products and services. For accounting professionals, we provide professional tax and financial management products and services.We do this through our platform that powers TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, Mailchimp, and Intuit Enterprise Suite. Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online are our leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States (U.S.).Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation.On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the all-in-one platform that customers use to grow and run their business. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information.On August 1, 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions in our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at the corporate level rather than at the segment level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we reclassified $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion from Global Business Solutions, $573 million and $475 million from Consumer, and $33 million and $34 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information.SeasonalityOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. Use of EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use judgments and estimates in determining how revenue should be recognized. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations, determining if the performance obligations are distinct, determining the standalone sales price (SSP) and timing of revenue recognition for each distinct performance obligation, and estimating variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. We use estimates in determining the collectibility of accounts receivable and notes receivable held for investment, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, and the fair value of notes receivable held for sale. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and fair values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.64 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing services, delivery of qualified links, marketing automation, live expert advice, financing for small and mid-market businesses, and desktop software products, desktop software subscriptions, and financial supplies. We enter into contracts with customers that include promises to transfer various products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration allocated to the respective performance obligation.Nature of Products and ServicesOnline OfferingsOur online offerings include TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live, ProConnect Tax Online, QuickBooks Online, Intuit Enterprise Suite, online payroll, and merchant payment processing services for small and mid-market businesses who use our online offerings. Our Mailchimp offerings include marketing automation.These online offerings provide customers with the right to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software and are billed on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to our online offerings that are billed on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to online offerings that are billed on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer consumes the related service. Desktop OfferingsOur desktop offerings consist of our subscription-based QuickBooks Desktop products, our consumer and professional tax desktop products, which include TurboTax, Lacerte and ProSeries, our desktop payroll products, and merchant payment processing services for small and mid-market businesses who use our desktop offerings.Our QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions include a term software license, version protection updates, when-and-if-available product upgrades and enhancements, support, and various connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and version protection updates at the time they are delivered and recognize revenue for when-and-if-available product upgrades and enhancements, support, and connected services over the subscription term as services are provided. For subscriptions sold in fiscal 2024, periodic delivery of version protection updates occurred through the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and the associated revenue was recognized upon delivery as noted above. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, product upgrades and enhancements are delivered on a when-and-if-available basis, and the associated revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term during which those product upgrades and enhancements are provided. Prior to fiscal 2025, we determined that the enhancements included in our QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions were not material within the context of the contract.Our consumer and professional tax desktop software products include an on-premise tax software license, related tax form updates, electronic filing service, and connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and related tax form updates, as one performance obligation, over the period the forms and updates are delivered. We recognize revenue for our electronic filings service and connected services as services are provided. We also sell some of our consumer tax desktop software products in non-consignment and consignment arrangements to certain retailers. For these retailers, we begin recognizing revenue when control has transferred to the retailer for non-consignment arrangements or to the customer for consignment arrangements.Our desktop payroll products are sold as software subscriptions and include a term software license with a stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws, support, and connected services. The term software license and stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws is considered one performance obligation. As a result, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term as services are provided. We offer merchant payment processing services as a separately paid connected service for our QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions, and revenue is recognized as services are provided to the customers.Other SolutionsRevenue from our Credit Karma segment is primarily comprised of revenue from the delivery of qualified links that result in completed actions, or cost-per-action transactions. Credit Karma also generates revenue from cost-per-click and cost-per-lead transactions.Cost-per-action revenue is earned based on a pre-determined fee for approved actions, such as when credit cards are issued or when personal loans and other loans to businesses are funded. Revenue is recognized when a lead is generated that results in one of these approved actions.Cost-per-click and cost-per-lead revenue is primarily related to mortgage and insurance businesses. Cost-per-click revenue is earned as users click on our customers' advertisements and is recognized based on the number of clicks recorded each month. Cost-per-lead revenue is earned via customer advertisements that allow the generation of leads from consumers interested in the advertised products and is recognized at the time a consumer request or lead is delivered to the customer. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K65Table of ContentsRevenue from the sale of our financial supplies, such as printed check stock, is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped.Interest revenue is earned on term loans originated or purchased and held for investment in accordance with the specified period of time and defined interest rate noted in the term loan contract and is recorded net of amortized deferred origination fees and costs, and term loan discounts. We recognize a gain or loss on the sale of term loans sold to third parties by calculating the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the term loans sold. Interest revenue and gains on sales of term loans were not material for all periods presented.We also have revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners and recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. In instances where we do not have reporting from our partners, we estimate revenue based on information available to us at the time. Adjustments to our estimates based on actual results have not been material to our consolidated financial statements for any period presented.Types of RevenueService revenue includes revenue from: our online offerings discussed above; our Credit Karma offerings; support, electronic filing services, when-and-if-available product upgrades and enhancements, and connected services included with our desktop offerings; merchant payment processing services; certain revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements; and interest on notes receivable.Product and other revenue includes revenue from: QuickBooks Desktop software licenses and version protection updates; consumer and professional tax desktop licenses and the related tax form updates; desktop payroll licenses and related updates; financial supplies; certain revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements; and interest on amounts held for customers.We record revenue net of sales tax obligations. For payroll services, we generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. Revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations. We hold customer cash as part of delivering payroll and payment services, and we include in total net revenue the interest earned on these funds from the time they are collected until the time that we remit them to outside parties or merchants.Judgments and EstimatesWe use a five-step process in determining how revenue is recognized, which requires judgment and estimates. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining whether the performance obligations are distinct, determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation, determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations, and estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services generally capable of being distinct performance obligations. SSPs for distinct performance obligations are based on directly observable pricing, when applicable. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.The functionality of the software licenses included in our consumer and professional tax and payroll desktop offerings is dependent on the related enhancements and updates included in these offerings. Judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the related updates and recognized over time.Our consumer and professional tax desktop products include an on-premise tax software license and related tax form updates that are recognized as the forms and updates are delivered. We measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the software license and related tax form updates using an output method based on the timing of when the tax forms are delivered. We generally provide refunds to customers for product returns and subscription cancellations. We also provide promotional discounts and incentive rebates on retail and distribution sales. These refunds, discounts, and incentive rebates are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Refunds are estimated based on historical experience and current business and economic indicators and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Discounts and incentive rebates are estimated based on distributors' and retailers' performance against the terms and conditions of the rebate programs.Deferred RevenueWe record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Our deferred revenue primarily relates to our subscription offerings. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, we recognized revenue of $871 million that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2024. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we recognized revenue of $920 million that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2023.66 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsOur performance obligations are generally satisfied within 12 months of the initial contract date. As of July 31, 2025 and 2024, the deferred revenue balance related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after 12 months was $4 million and $4 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term obligations on our consolidated balance sheets.Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a CustomerOur sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining the contract with a customer. Sales commissions for subscription offerings where we expect the benefit of those costs to continue longer than one year are capitalized and amortized ratably over the period of benefit, which ranges from three to four years. As of July 31, 2025 and 2024, total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $122 million and $94 million, respectively, and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.We apply a practical expedient to expense costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer when the period of benefit is less than one year. These costs primarily include internal and external sales commissions for our consumer and professional tax offerings.Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product and other revenue, and we record the related costs as cost of product and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. We also include the costs of providing technical support for our desktop offerings in cost of service revenue. We include the costs of customer service related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, email, and other electronic means, and providing technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this support as incurred.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.Internal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to the development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to six years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability.    AdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $2.1 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, $1.7 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, and $1.5 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023.LeasesOur leases are primarily operating leases for office facilities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease and classify it as either a finance or operating lease at lease inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Our leases generally do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Our  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K67Table of Contentsincremental borrowing rate is determined based on a yield curve derived from publicly traded bond offerings for companies with similar credit ratings to ours. Our lease terms may include options to purchase, extend, or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.We measure ROU assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date, net of lease incentives. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized as lease expense is incurred. Our variable lease payments generally relate to amounts paid to lessors for common area maintenance under our real estate leases.Our subleases generally do not relieve us of our primary obligations under the corresponding head lease. As a result, we account for the head lease based on the original assessment at inception. We determine if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease at inception. If the total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than the anticipated sublease income, the ROU asset is assessed for impairment. Our subleases are generally operating leases, and we recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not material for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate the revenue, costs, and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not material for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.68 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsComputation of Net Income Per ShareWe compute basic net income per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. Dividend rights apply to all RSUs that we grant and are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities, and we do not present them separately in earnings per share. The following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated. Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)202520242023Numerator:  Net income$3,869 $2,963 $2,384 Denominator:   Shares used in basic per share calculations:   Weighted-average common shares outstanding280 280 281 Shares used in diluted per share calculations:   Weighted-average common shares outstanding280 280 281 Dilutive potential common equivalent shares from share-based awards3 4 2 Dilutive weighted-average common shares outstanding283 284 283 Basic and diluted net income per share:   Basic net income per share$13.82 $10.58 $8.49 Diluted net income per share$13.67 $10.43 $8.42 Shares excluded from diluted net income per share:Weighted-average share-based awards that have been excluded from dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding due to their anti-dilutive effect— 1 1 Cash Equivalents and InvestmentsWe consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. In all periods presented, cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Investments consist primarily of investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. Except for direct obligations of the U.S. government, securities issued by agencies of the U.S. government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K69Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. Third-party payment processor receivables due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit and debit card transactions for the sales of our products and services are included in accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for credit losses. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses, customer-specific information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible, we write them off against the allowance.Funds Receivable and Amounts Held for Customers and Funds Payable and Amounts Due to CustomersFunds receivable and amounts held for customers represent funds receivable from third-party payment processors for customer transactions, funds in transit to our customers, and funds held on behalf of our customers that are invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities, restricted for use solely for the purpose of satisfying amounts we owe on behalf of our customers. Funds payable and amounts due to customers consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Our obligations with respect to funds we transmit on behalf of our customers are satisfied when the funds are settled in the customers’ accounts. These obligations, including funds in transit to our customers, are reflected in funds payable and amounts due to customers in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not record any material property or equipment impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period, which is defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination.Under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination, such as investment banking, legal, and other professional fees, are not considered part of consideration, and we recognize such costs as general and administrative expenses as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method, we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date, and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be material retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period, and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.70 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as purchased technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to 15 years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Impairment charges for acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets were not material for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.Share-Based Compensation PlansRSUs granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established market or performance goals. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity,” for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K71Table of ContentsRestructuringWe record charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans as restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations. These charges may include severance and employee benefits, and costs to vacate facilities. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and the amounts are estimable, or when notifications occur, depending on the region where the employee works. The liability for restructuring charges is included in accrued compensation and related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities, and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our material balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the U.S. government, securities issued by agencies of the U.S. government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. Our cash balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits.We sell a portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024 or 2023, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2025 or July 31, 2024.We primarily use two third-party public cloud providers for our cloud hosting needs. Additionally, we rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a material negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Accounting Standards Recently AdoptedSegment Information - In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This standard requires incremental segment information disclosures, including disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 on a retrospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIncome Tax - In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This standard requires additional disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and other income tax-related disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, which means that it will be effective for us for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2026. Early adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Income Statement - Expense Disaggregation - In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,” and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date,” which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. This standard requires entities to disaggregate operating expenses into specific categories such as employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, by relevant expense caption on the statement of operations. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, which means that it will be effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2028 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2029. Early adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2024-03 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.72 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsBusiness Combinations and Consolidation - In May 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-03, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) and Consolidation (Topic 810): Determining the Accounting Acquirer in the Acquisition of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE).” This standard clarifies the guidance in determining the accounting acquirer in a business combination effected primarily by exchanging equity interests when the acquiree is a VIE that meets the definition of a business.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above. At July 31, 2025At July 31, 2024(In millions)Level 1Level 2TotalFair ValueLevel 1Level 2TotalFair ValueAssets:      Cash equivalents, primarily money market funds$1,790 $— $1,790 $2,538 $— $2,538 Available-for-sale debt securities:    Corporate notes— 502 502 — 456 456 U.S. agency securities— 1,316 1,316 — 159 159 Total available-for-sale debt securities— 1,818 1,818 — 615 615 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis$1,790 $1,818 $3,608 $2,538 $615 $3,153  Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K73Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities by balance sheet classification and level in the fair value hierarchy at the dates indicated: At July 31, 2025At July 31, 2024(In millions)Level 1Level 2TotalFair ValueLevel 1Level 2TotalFair ValueCash equivalents:      In cash and cash equivalents$1,790 $— $1,790 $2,538 $— $2,538 Available-for-sale debt securities:      In investments$— $1,668 $1,668 $— $465 $465 In funds receivable and amounts held for customers— 150 150 — 150 150 Total available-for-sale debt securities$— $1,818 $1,818 $— $615 $615 We value our Level 1 assets, consisting primarily of money market funds, using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.Financial assets whose fair values we measure using Level 3 inputs consist of notes receivable held for sale. These notes receivables are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As of July 31, 2025 we held no notes receivable held for sale. As of July 31, 2024, total notes receivable held for sale was not material and the difference between amortized cost and fair value was not material.Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of senior unsecured notes. See Note 7, “Debt,” for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior unsecured notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. At July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the senior unsecured notes was $5.0 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. At July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the carrying value of the senior unsecured notes was $5.0 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. See Note 7, “Debt,” for more information. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and our long-term investments. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.Long-term investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. They are accounted for at cost and adjusted based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value of these investments using a valuation method based on observable transaction price changes at the transaction date.

Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024 were not material. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The estimate of the credit loss is determined by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit loss is recorded to interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Any excess unrealized loss greater than the allowance for credit loss at a security level is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We determined there were no credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2025 were not material. We do not intend to sell these investments.

Notes Receivable and Allowances for Credit LossesAs of July 31, 2025 and 2024, our notes receivable portfolio consisted of notes receivable held for investment, including term loans to small and mid-market businesses and refund advance loans to consumers, and notes receivable held for sale, including term loans to small and mid-market businesses. We classify notes receivable as held for investment when we have both the intent and ability to hold until maturity or payoff. We classify notes receivable as held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell substantially all of our rights and interests in a qualified loan to a third-party investor. A note receivable that is initially designated as held for sale or held for investment may be reclassified when our intent for that individual note receivable changes. When a note receivable held for investment is reclassified to held for sale and recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, the related allowance for credit losses for that note receivable is released, and any adjustment to record the loan at the lower of amortized cost or fair value is recorded.Notes Receivable Held for InvestmentTerm loans to small and mid-market businesses. We provide financing to small and mid-market businesses via term loans that we originate directly or through an originating bank partner. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024, we purchased term loans from our originating bank partner with principal balances in the amount of $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. As of July 31, 2025, we had commitments to purchase $38 million in term loans that were originated on or prior to July 31, 2025.The term loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs and fees, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses. As of July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the net notes receivable held for investment balance for term loans to small and mid-market businesses was $1.5 billion and $912 million, respectively. The current portion is included in notes receivable held for investment and the long-term portion is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.We maintain an allowance for credit losses on notes receivable held for investment to reserve for expected credit losses in the notes receivable portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on our current estimate of expected credit losses, historical credit losses, estimates of recoveries, and future expectations as of each balance sheet date. We evaluate the creditworthiness of our notes receivable portfolio on a pooled basis due to its composition of term loans with similar general credit risk and characteristics. The allowance for credit losses is subjective and requires management estimates, including such factors as known and inherent risks in the notes receivable portfolio, use of historical credit losses to estimate expected credit losses, adverse situations that may affect borrowers' ability to repay, and current and forecasted economic conditions. Expected credit losses are measured based on a credit loss forecasting model and calculated by applying loss curves derived from loan level risk segment and term mixes, aggregated at monthly loan vintages. Loss curves are estimated based on a combination of empirical loss curve data and management judgment. We use empirical data and management judgment to estimate losses for new credit tests or products for which we do not have enough history. The methodologies are updated periodically to reflect factors such as actual term loan performance and changes in assumptions based on the risk characteristics of the notes receivable portfolio. When available information confirms that the specific term loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, identified amounts are charged off against the allowance for credit losses. Term loans are charged off as the contractual principal becomes 120 days past due or meets certain other charge-off policy requirements. Subsequent recoveries of the unpaid principal balance, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. As of July 31, 2025 and 76 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsJuly 31, 2024, the allowances for credit losses, amount of charge-offs recorded, and amount of recoveries on term loans to small and mid-market businesses were not material.We consider a term loan to be delinquent when the payments are one day past due. We place delinquent term loans on nonaccrual status and stop accruing interest revenue. Term loans are returned to accrual status if they are brought current or have performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and, in our judgment, will continue to make periodic principal and interest payments as per the contractual terms. Past due amounts were not material for all periods presented.Refund Advance Loans. Refund advance loans are loans available to eligible TurboTax customers based on a customer's anticipated income tax refund, at no cost to the customer. These loans are repaid from the customer's income tax refund, which is generally received within three to four weeks after acceptance of the customer's income tax return by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We partner with a third-party issuing bank to originate the loans and subsequently purchase full participating interests in those loans. The refund advance loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, net of an allowance for credit losses. As of July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the net notes receivable balances for refund advance loans were not material. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible loans. We estimate the allowance for credit losses based on the expected funding of refunds by the IRS using historical trends. When we determine that any amounts are uncollectible, we charge them off against the allowance for credit losses. As of July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the allowances for credit losses on refund advance loans were not material.Notes Receivable Held for SaleTerm loans to small and mid-market businesses. We have entered into multiple forward flow arrangements with institutional investors that facilitate the sale of participation interests in eligible unsecured term loans. These arrangements have varying terms, with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2029. Total sales of term loans during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024 were $543 million and $323 million, respectively. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, gains on sales of term loans and servicing income were not material.Notes receivable held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual term loan basis. As of July 31, 2025 we held no notes receivable as held for sale. As of July 31, 2024, the balances of notes receivable held for sale was $3 million, and is included in notes receivable held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. 5.

On February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small and mid-market businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). 80 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsThe 2019 Secured Facility is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. and is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary, which are in excess of the amount outstanding under the 2019 Secured Facility as of July 31, 2025. We have entered into several amendments to this facility. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the benchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $300 million is committed and $200 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at adjusted daily simple SOFR plus 1.25%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through August 31, 2027, and the final maturity date is August 31, 2028. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2019 Secured Facility. At July 31, 2025, $440 million was outstanding under the 2019 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.74%. Interest on the 2019 Secured Facility is payable monthly. 2022 Secured Facility. On October 12, 2022, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small and mid-market businesses (the 2022 Secured Facility). The 2022 Secured Facility is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. and is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary, which are in excess of the amount outstanding under the 2022 Secured Facility as of July 31, 2025. We have entered into several amendments to this facility. These amendments primarily extend the commitment term and final maturity date, increase the commitment amount, and reduce the interest rate. Under the amended 2022 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $500 million, of which $400 million is committed and $100 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus 1.1%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from 0.2% to 0.4%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through April 30, 2027, and the final maturity date is May 1, 2028. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2022 Secured Facility. At July 31, 2025, $300 million was outstanding under the 2022 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.56%, which includes the fee on the unused committed portion. Interest on the 2022 Secured Facility is payable monthly.2024 Secured Facility. On November 1, 2024, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small and mid-market businesses (the 2024 Secured Facility). The 2024 Secured Facility is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. and is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary, which are in excess of the amount outstanding under the 2024 Secured Facility as of July 31, 2025. We have entered into several amendments to this facility. These amendments primarily increased the commitment amount. Under the amended 2024 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $300 million, all of which is committed. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus 1.15%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from 0.2% to 0.4%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through November 1, 2027, and the final maturity date is November 1, 2028. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2024 Secured Facility. At July 31, 2025, $274 million was outstanding under the 2024 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.56%, which includes the fee on the unused committed portion. Interest on the 2024 Secured Facility is payable monthly.Commercial Paper ProgramUnder our established commercial paper program, we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) up to $1.5 billion. The maturities of the commercial paper may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, we temporarily increased the capacity of our commercial paper program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion to support our seasonal working capital needs. As of July 31, 2025, the capacity of the commercial paper program was $1.5 billion. At July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under this program. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K81Table of Contents8.

LeasesWe lease office facilities under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facility leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and may contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 17 years, which include options to extend that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Some of our leases include one or more options to extend the lease for up to 10 years per option, which we are not reasonably certain to exercise. The options to extend are generally at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised.82 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsWe sublease certain office facilities to third parties.

The OBBBA has multiple effective dates from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2027. The provisions effective during fiscal 2025 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.In the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws.

We have also provided a valuation allowance on other non-California state operating loss and foreign loss carryforwards. We have provided a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets as we believe they are unlikely to be realized. We have a valuation allowance of $290 million and $227 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $63 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to an increase in the allowance for California net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $8 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to a decrease in the allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards, net of an increase in the allowance for California net deferred tax assets.At July 31, 2025, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2032. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2025, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $137 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $9 million and a valuation allowance of $6 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2028. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2025, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $18 million which carry forward indefinitely. We maintain a full valuation allowance with respect to the foreign net operating losses as there is not sufficient evidence of future sources of taxable income required to utilize such carryforwards.At July 31, 2025, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $426 million. The California research and experimentation credit will carry forward indefinitely. We maintain a full valuation allowance with respect to the California research and experimentation credit carryforwards as there is not sufficient evidence of future sources of taxable income required to utilize such carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax BenefitsThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)202520242023Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance$327 $246 $216 Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions11 36 11 Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years(21)(12)(16)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year91 95 38 Settlements with tax authorities(2)(1)(2)Lapse of statute of limitations(12)(37)(1)Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance$394 $327 $246 The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2025 was $394 million. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $276 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdiction is the U.S. federal jurisdiction. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2022 except for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016.We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024 for the payment of interest and penalties were not material. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were also not material.We offset a $61 million and $66 million long-term liability for uncertain tax positions against our long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The long-term income tax receivable for both periods was primarily related to the government’s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018. 86 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contents11. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase Programs and Treasury SharesIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $2.8 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025. At July 31, 2025, we had authorization from our Board of Directors for up to $2.1 billion in stock repurchases. On August 19, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization under the existing stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $3.2 billion of our common stock. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Any direct costs to acquire treasury stock are recorded to treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.In the past, we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. For all periods presented, we issued new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.Dividends on Common StockDuring the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, we declared cash dividends that totaled $4.16 per share of outstanding common stock, or approximately $1.2 billion. In August 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.20 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 17, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2025. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Description of 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 18, 2024, our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 18, 2034. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price, and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 171.7 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs that were granted on or after July 21, 2016 are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three to four years based on continued service and have a seven-year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three to four years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.In connection with our acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3, 2020, we assumed the Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (Credit Karma Plan), under which the assumed equity awards were granted. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, effective January 20, 2022, shares available under the Credit Karma Plan became available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan and no shares may be granted out of the Credit Karma Plan. After January 20, 2022, shares forfeited and returned to the pool from grants issued out of the Credit Karma Plan increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K87Table of ContentsAt July 31, 2025, there were approximately 25.1 million shares available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan.Description of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996, our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 25.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by our Board of Directors, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit’s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 306,286 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025; 360,028 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024; and 399,975 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2023. At July 31, 2025, there were 1,657,666 shares available for issuance under this plan.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income for the periods shown. Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)202520242023Cost of service revenue$420 $398 $371 Cost of product and other revenue3 4 3 Selling and marketing541 506 429 Research and development629 639 532 General and administrative375 368 377 Restructuring— 25 — Total share-based compensation expense 1,968 1,940 1,712 Income tax benefit(548)(594)(373)Decrease in net income$1,420 $1,346 $1,339 Determining Fair ValueValuation and Amortization MethodsRSUs granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. These time-based RSUs accounted for approximately 91% of our total share-based compensation expense during the twelve months ended July 31, 2025. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established market or performance goals. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. Each quarter, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends.We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.88 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of ContentsExpected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model.

Benefit PlansNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation PlanIntuit’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries and up to 75% of their bonuses. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We do not guarantee above-market interest on account balances. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts, and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants may elect to receive their payments in a lump sum or installments. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death, or a change in control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $248 million at July 31, 2025 and $207 million at July 31, 2024. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar-performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets, while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.401(k) PlansIn the U.S., employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to IRS limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of compensation, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts and IRS limitations. Additionally, Credit Karma employees in the U.S. who participate in the Credit Karma 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 90% of pre-tax compensation, subject to IRS limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of Credit Karma employee contributions, currently 100% up to six percent of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts and IRS limitations.Matching contributions for both plans were $149 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025; $138 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2024; and $136 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K93Table of Contents13. Legal ProceedingsBeginning in May 2019, various legal proceedings were filed and certain regulatory inquiries were commenced in connection with our provision and marketing of free online tax preparation programs. We believe that the allegations contained within these legal proceedings are without merit and continue to defend our interests in them. These proceedings included, among others, multiple putative class actions that were consolidated into a single putative class action in the Northern District of California in September 2019 (the Intuit Free File Litigation). In August 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the putative class action claims be resolved through arbitration. In May 2021, the Intuit Free File Litigation was dismissed on a non-class basis after we entered into an agreement that resolved the matter on an individual non-class basis, without any admission of wrongdoing, for an amount that was not material. These proceedings also include a class action lawsuit that was filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice on August 25, 2022.These proceedings also included individual demands for arbitration that were filed beginning in October 2019. As of January 31, 2023, we settled all of these arbitration claims, without any admission of wrongdoing, for an amount that was not material. In June 2021, we received a demand and draft complaint from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and certain state attorneys general relating to the ongoing inquiries described above. On March 29, 2022, the FTC filed an action in federal court seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining certain Intuit business practices pending resolution of the FTC’s administrative complaint seeking to permanently enjoin certain Intuit business practices (the FTC Actions). On April 22, 2022, the Northern District of California denied the FTC’s requests for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Beginning on March 27, 2023, a final hearing on the administrative action was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) at the FTC and, on August 29, 2023, the FTC’s ALJ issued a decision in favor of the FTC and adverse to Intuit. On January 19, 2024, the FTC Commissioners affirmed the ALJ’s decision and issued a final order that requires us to adhere to certain marketing practices and does not contain any monetary penalties. On January 21, 2024, we filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and this appeal is pending. The FTC’s order became effective on March 23, 2024, and is now pending review by the Court of Appeals. We intend to continue to defend our position on the merits of this case. However, the defense and resolution of this matter could involve significant costs. The state attorneys general did not join the FTC Actions, and, on May 4, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, admitting no wrongdoing, that resolved the states’ inquiry, as well as actions brought by the Los Angeles City Attorney and the Santa Clara County (California) Counsel. As part of this agreement, we agreed to pay $141 million and made certain commitments regarding our advertising and marketing practices. We recorded this as a one-time charge in the quarter ended April 30, 2022, and paid the full amount to the fund administrator in the quarter ended January 31, 2023.In view of the complexity and ongoing and uncertain nature of the outstanding proceedings and inquiries, at this time, we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible financial loss or range of financial loss that we may incur to resolve or settle the remaining matters. To date, the legal and other fees we have incurred related to these proceedings and inquiries have not been material. The ongoing defense and any resolution or settlement of these proceedings and inquiries could involve significant costs to us. Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries, and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Our failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources, and other factors.14. Segment InformationWe have defined our four reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker (CODM) views results. We define the CODM as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our CODM uses regularly provided segment revenue and segment operating income to assess operating performance and allocate company resources.On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the all-in-one platform that customers use to grow and run their business.On August 1, 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions in our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at the corporate level rather than at the segment level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we reclassified expenses totaling $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion from Global Business Solutions, $573 million and 94 Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-KTable of Contents$475 million from Consumer, and $33 million and $34 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively, to conform to the current presentation.Consistent with our vision to deliver one consumer platform, effective August 1, 2025, we combined the Consumer, Credit Karma, and ProTax businesses into a single Consumer business. We will reflect this new organization in our fiscal 2026 segment reporting.Global Business Solutions: This segment serves small and mid-market businesses around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. QuickBooks and Intuit Enterprise Suite are offerings powered by our all-in-one business platform which includes financial management services, human capital management solutions such as payroll and time tracking, money solutions, such as merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner, and financing for small and mid-market businesses. Intuit Enterprise Suite provides mid-market businesses with a configurable, AI-powered solution that includes multi-entity and multi-dimensional financial management capabilities designed to seamlessly scale and enhance productivity and profitability for more complex businesses to streamline operations. Mailchimp offerings include marketing automation and customer relationship tools.Consumer: This segment primarily serves consumers, helping customers get their taxes done with confidence—whether they do it themselves or with the help of an AI-enabled human expert. TurboTax delivers do-it-yourself and assisted income tax preparation products and services sold in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Credit Karma: This segment serves consumers with a personal finance offering that helps members find the right financial products and make smarter money decisions throughout the year to reach their financial goals. This includes personalized recommendations for credit card, home, auto, and personal loan, and insurance products; online savings and checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner; and access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, credit building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress.ProTax: This segment serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.All of our segments operate primarily in the U.S. and sell primarily to customers in the U.S. Total international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, general and administrative, and non-employment related legal and litigation settlement costs, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. As part of our platform strategy, we also include customer success and product development for our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments in unallocated corporate items as we do not allocate these expenses to the segments because they are managed at the platform level. Customer success includes the costs of tax and bookkeeping experts that support our TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live offerings. For our Credit Karma reportable segment, segment expenses include certain direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, professional fees and transaction charges related to business combinations, and restructuring charges.The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,” for goodwill by reportable segment. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K95Table of ContentsThe following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated.  Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)202520242023Net revenue:  Global Business Solutions$11,077 $9,533 $8,038 Consumer4,870 4,445 4,135 Credit Karma2,263 1,708 1,634 ProTax621 599 561 Total net revenue$18,831 $16,285 $14,368 Segment cost of revenue and operating expenses:Global Business Solutions(1)$2,610 $2,376 $2,138 Consumer(1)1,084 952 785 Credit Karma(2)1,428 1,294 1,206 ProTax(1)88 79 72 Total segment cost of revenues and operating expenses$5,210 $4,701 $4,201 Operating income:   Global Business Solutions$8,467 $7,157 $5,900 Consumer3,786 3,493 3,350 Credit Karma835 414 428 ProTax533 520 489 Total segment operating income13,621 11,584 10,167 Unallocated corporate items:   Share-based compensation expense(1,968)(1,915)(1,712)Other corporate expenses(6,078)(5,187)(4,668)Amortization of acquired technology(156)(146)(163)Amortization of other acquired intangible assets(481)(483)(483)Restructuring charges (3)(15)(223)— Total unallocated corporate items(8,698)(7,954)(7,026)Total operating income$4,923 $3,630 $3,141 (1)    For our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily include direct expenses related to selling and marketing, direct costs associated with our product and services offerings, and certain design and product management related costs.

RestructuringIn July 2024, our management approved, committed to, and initiated a plan of reorganization (the Plan) focused on reallocating resources to our key growth areas. The Plan included the exit of employees and the closing of real estate sites in certain markets to support growing technology teams and capabilities in strategic locations. The actions associated with the Plan were substantially complete in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Total restructuring costs associated with the Plan were $238 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded charges in connection with the Plan of $15 million and $223 million, respectively. These charges are primarily related to severance and employee benefits and are recorded to restructuring in our consolidated statements of operations.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit’s Board of Directors.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended July 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.ITEM 9B - OTHER INFORMATIONDuring the three months ended July 31, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).ITEM 9C - DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONSNone. Intuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K99Table of ContentsPART IIIITEM 10 - DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEWe maintain a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including all officers.
