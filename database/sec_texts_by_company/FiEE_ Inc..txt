EXPLANATORY NOTE
FiEE,
Inc., formerly known as Minim, Inc., (“Minim,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and similar
terms) is filing this Amendment No. 2 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K/A”) for the year ended
December 31, 2023 to amend and restate certain items presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023
which was initially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 12, 2024 (as amended on April
29, 2024, the “Original Form 10-K”). This amendment is limited in scope to make the following changes to the original filing:
·To amend Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.
·To amend Part IV - Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules to include currently dated (i) auditor consent, which is filed
herewith as Exhibits 23.1 and (ii) certifications from the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which certifications are filed herewith as Exhibits 31.1,
31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.
The Form
10-K/A contains our audited restated annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. This Form 10-K/A includes
a restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations, and stockholders’
equity for the year then ended. There are no changes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. This Form 10-K/A
also includes amendments to: the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certifications in Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2
and the financial statements formatted in Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) in Exhibit 101.
This
amendment has not been updated or amended to give effect to any subsequent events beyond those that existed as of the original filing
date and should thus be read in conjunction with the original filing and any of the Company’s other filings with the SEC subsequent
to the original filing, together with any amendments to those filings. Other than the filing of the information identified above, this
amendment does not modify or update the disclosure in the original filing in any way.
Overview
The Audit
Committee of the Company, after consultation with the Company’s management, concluded that the financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2023 previously filed by the Company with the SEC should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial
statements relating to the recording and reporting of common stock shares outstanding, including earning per share.
Accordingly,
investors should no longer rely upon the Company’s previously released financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023 and should rely instead on this 10-K/A. The Company’s management identified an error in the shares of the Company’s common
stock outstanding in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.
The outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock was incorrectly reported as 2,632,809 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The corrected number
of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock is reported in this Form 10-K/A as 2,789,020.
The error
in the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock did not impact the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
As a result of the restatement included herein, the
Company is reporting herein 2,789,020 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023, which
is more than the 2,632,809 shares of the Company’s common stock reported as outstanding in the Original Form 10-K. Consequently,
the Company is reporting herein weighted average shares of the Company’s common stock for the year ended December 31, 2023 of 2,038,461
and basic and diluted net loss per share of $8.65 per share, compared to the weighted average shares of Common Stock reported in the Original
Form 10-K of 1,941,800 and basic and diluted net loss of $9.08 per share.

ITEM 8 – CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To the shareholders and the board of directors
of
Fiee, Inc. formerly known as Minim, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Fiee, Inc. formerly known as Minim, Inc. as of December 31, 2023, the related statements of operations, stockholders’ (deficit), and
cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
2
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole10, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
During 2023 audit, we discovered that Minim has
had continual problems in receiving accurate and detailed information from management at the outside contract warehouses where it stores
the majority of its inventory. Inventory is a significant income-producing asset for the organization and we strongly suggest that procedures
be implemented to ensure that accurate inventory information is received for financial reporting purposes. This presented us with a challenge
in confirming the actual amounts of inventory that were being held at these contract warehouses.

(2)SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (AMENDED)
Loss Per Common Share
Basic loss per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. For the purposes of this
calculation, stock options are considered common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect. Stock options that
are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation.
Net loss per share for the
year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are as follows:
