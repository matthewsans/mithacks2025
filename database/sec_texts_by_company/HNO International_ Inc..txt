Our Products
We have three products that
we manufacture and sell:
1.CHRS (Compact Hydrogen Refueling Station): A cost-effective solution for rapidly deploying hydrogen
production in the 50 KG to 200 KG per day range. It has a dispensing system that can be adapted for vehicles (trucks, buses, etc.), warehouse
equipment (forklifts), or other fuel cell applications, including power generation.
2.HCC (Hydrogen Carbon Cleaner): A device used to clean carbon deposits from internal combustion engines.
3.SHEP (Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform) SHEP is an innovative scalable,
modular hydrogen energy system that efficiently produces, stores, and dispenses green hydrogen made from water. Our cost-effective platform
prioritizes flexibility and is designed to meet a wide range of diverse, growing hydrogen demands across multifaceted applications.
The need for hydrogen refueling stations is growing
as more fuel cell vehicles come on the road. Current solutions are expensive, require a long permitting and installation process, and
consistently face outages. Our Compact Hydrogen Refueling System (“CHRS”) seeks to solve these problems and address
market demand.
We are also involved with Scalable Hydrogen Energy
Platform (“SHEP”) where the volume of hydrogen that can be produced is from 100 Kilograms per day to over 2,000 (or
more) kilograms per day for use in commercial applications such as fuel for transportation, power generation, and industrial processes,
as well as in the production of chemicals and materials. We also develop energy systems that complement the zero-emissions infrastructure,
reduce harmful emissions such as black carbon and other greenhouse gasses, and cut maintenance costs of commercial diesel fleets. Our
designs and integrates components from leading industry partners in order to transition fossil fuels to cleaner burning alternatives which
promote lower emissions.
Currently, we are building
and setting up a manufacturing line for 1.25 MW electrolyzers to be able to produce one per day. We have also ordered the equipment necessary
and leased the land required (approximately $450,000) to build the first Hydrogen Farm located in Katy Texas and that is scheduled for
full operation producing hydrogen in April 2025, with expected revenues of $2,500,000 over next 15-20 months. We have also identified
and contracted a second location for hydrogen production in Lancaster, California. We are in the hydrogen infrastructure business. Over
the next 12 months we plan to identify another 10 - 15 locations to continue to build Hydrogen production locations, with expected expenditures
of approximately $20,000,000 over the next 15-20 months and expected revenues of $15,000,000 - $25,000,000 over the next 15-20.
We have taken delivery of
the first 10 Hydrogen Carbon Cleaners for sale to customers in mid-March 2025. After demonstrating the technology to prospective customers,
we expect to take orders and schedule delivery in 30 - 60 days after a customer order. These materials for these items have already
been paid for out of the current budget.
The CHRS unit has been built
and we began marketing it to customers for delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2025.
Revenues from the sales of units is not guaranteed
and, as stated in Note 4 to our audited financial statements, at October 31, 2024, we had a deficit of $44,326,326
and have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations and we will be required to
raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements until we are able to raise revenues to a point of positive
cash flow.
Hydrogen Refueling
The market for hydrogen refueling stations is currently
in a state of growth, as the use of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”) is becoming more popular. Governments,
private companies, and research institutions around the world are investing in the development of hydrogen refueling infrastructure to
support the growth of the FCEV market.
Currently, most hydrogen refueling stations are located
in California, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. These countries have actively invested in developing hydrogen infrastructure and, as a
result, have a larger number of stations available.
According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global
hydrogen refueling station market size was valued at USD $1.7 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD $7.5 billion by 2025, at a
CAGR of 34.5% during the forecast period.[1]
[1] https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/green-hydrogen-market-92444177.html#:~:text=The%20global%20green%20hydrogen%20market,cagr%20during%20the%20forecast%20period.

However, the market for hydrogen refueling stations
is still relatively small compared to other alternative fuels, such as electric charging stations. The high cost of building and maintaining
hydrogen stations, lack of economies of scale, and lack of hydrogen production facilities, have hindered the market’s growth.
Despite these challenges, the market for hydrogen
refueling stations is expected to grow in the future as the number of FCEVs on the road increases and more countries begin to invest in
the development of hydrogen infrastructure.
Fuel Cell EV Growth
The expected growth of FCEVs is projected to be significant
in the coming years. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global fuel cell electric vehicle market size is projected to reach
1.63 million units by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 42.2% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030.[2]
This growth is driven by several factors, including
increasing government support and funding for the development of hydrogen infrastructure, advancements in fuel cell technology, and increasing
consumer awareness and acceptance of FCEVs.
In addition, many countries have set ambitious targets
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and deploying FCEVs is seen as a key measure to achieving these goals.
However, it's worth noting that the expected growth
of FCEVs is highly dependent on the success of the hydrogen economy and the availability of hydrogen fueling stations. The growth of FCEVs
also depends on the cost of hydrogen and the competition with other technologies such as battery electric vehicles.
Overall, the growth of FCEVs is expected to be significant
in the coming years, but the growth rate may vary depending on the region and the success of the hydrogen economy.
Current Problems
There are several common problems associated with
current hydrogen refueling stations:
1.
Cost: Building and maintaining hydrogen refueling stations can be expensive, and the high cost can be a barrier to the widespread deployment of the technology.
2.
Limited availability: Hydrogen fueling stations are currently much less common than gasoline or electric charging stations, which can make it difficult for FCEV owners to find a refueling location.
3.
Complexity: Hydrogen fueling stations are complex systems that require specialized knowledge and training to operate and maintain.
4.
Safety concerns: Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and there are concerns about the safety of storing and dispensing it at refueling stations.
5.
Hydrogen production: One of the major challenges with hydrogen refueling stations is their limited access to locally produced hydrogen, often relying on hydrogen created using processes that generate pollution, such as steam methane reforming, which undermines the environmental benefits of using hydrogen as a fuel source.
6.
Lack of standardization: There is currently no standardization in the design and operation of hydrogen fueling stations, which can make it difficult for different types of vehicles to refuel at different stations.
7.
Limited production capacity: The current capacity of hydrogen production is limited, which can make it difficult to supply enough hydrogen to meet the increasing demand for FCEVs.
8.
Lack of economies of scale: The small number of hydrogen stations and vehicles currently in operation makes it difficult to achieve economies of scale and reduce costs.
Overall, current hydrogen refueling stations face
several challenges, but with ongoing research and development, we believe these issues can be addressed and overcome in the future.

Our Unique Solution
Compact and Modular
Our CHRS delivers modular, compact green hydrogen
refueling stations and could have significant value in the growing hydrogen FCEV market. These types of stations are designed to be compact,
easy to install, and highly efficient, which can help to reduce the cost of building and maintaining the typical hydrogen refueling stations.
One of the main advantages of CHRS is that they can
be quickly and easily deployed in various locations, such as urban areas, parking garages, residential locations, along highway corridors,
even at a consumer's home. They can be quickly located with a smartphone app, and once located, the hydrogen availability can be determined
and the hours of operation of the station. Because of the way the current infrastructure is set up, including the lack of hydrogen production
on-site, it is often impossible for a customer to know if they will even be able to get fuel or not until they actually arrive at one
of the extremely limited refueling locations. The CHRS system will increase the availability of hydrogen fueling options for FCEV owners,
making it easier for them to refuel their vehicles and for manufacturers to sell their hydrogen vehicles because of the availability of
hundreds of fueling stations.
Additionally, these types of stations can be powered
by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, which can reduce their environmental impact and help to promote the use of green
hydrogen.
Another advantage of these stations is that they can
be easily expanded as the demand for hydrogen fuel increases. This can help to ensure that there is always enough hydrogen available to
meet the needs of FCEV owners.
Overall, a product that delivers modular, compact
green hydrogen refueling stations can be a disruptive factor and help to spur the growth of the FCEV market, by making it more convenient,
affordable, and environmentally friendly for FCEV owners to refuel their vehicles, and it can help to support the growth of the hydrogen
economy.
Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform (SHEP)
Unlike traditional large-scale hydrogen production
plants, our plants are smaller, low-cost, and quicker to permit, install, and scale. One of the key benefits of our approach is the use
of low-cost, PGM-free electrolysis technology. This technology eliminates the need for expensive and rare platinum group metals, making
green hydrogen production more sustainable and cost-effective. This is particularly important in today's market, where the price of these
metals has been increasing, making traditional hydrogen production more expensive.
Another benefit of our approach is the ability to
scale green hydrogen production quickly. Our plants are designed to be quickly installed and operational, allowing them to respond quickly
to changes in market demand. This is important as the green hydrogen market is rapidly growing, and companies need a reliable source of
clean energy to meet this demand.
In addition, our approach is more environmentally
friendly than traditional hydrogen production methods. We use renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power to produce green hydrogen,
reducing the carbon footprint of hydrogen production. This is becoming increasingly important as more companies seek to adopt clean energy
solutions and reduce their environmental impact.
We also have a robust supply chain, sourcing high-quality
equipment from trusted suppliers. This ensures that our plants are reliable and efficient, reducing the risk of production disruptions
and increasing the overall value of our services to customers.
In the case of the Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform
(“SHEP”), where the volume of hydrogen that can be produced is from 100 Kilograms per day to over 2,000 (or more) kilograms
per day, we can service current and emerging hydrogen gas markets, including ammonia, fertilizer, steel, mining, electronics, semiconductors,
in addition to fuel cell refueling stations.
Existing Engines
We are manufacturing custom hydrogen carbon cleaning
equipment for engine service providers in the engine cleaning industry. Hydrogen can is currently used for Internal Combustion Engine
(“ICE”) decarbonization and maintenance prevention market through manufacturing hydrogen carbon cleaning equipment
for engine service providers.
We, as a technology company, have been actively developing

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
The following are important factors we have identified
that could affect an investment in our securities. You should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in our securities,
because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or any forward-looking statements. The risks
described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
We need to continue as a going concern if our business is to succeed.
Our independent registered public accounting firm
reports on our audited financial statements for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, indicate that there are a number of factors
that raise substantial risks about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors identified in the report are our accumulated
deficit since inception, our failure to attain profitable operations, the excess of liabilities over assets, and our dependence upon obtaining
adequate additional financing to pay our liabilities. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, investors could lose their investments.
We have a limited operating history.
We have a limited operating history. We will, in all
likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least for the foreseeable future. We can make no assurances
that we will be able to effectuate our strategies or otherwise to generate sufficient revenue to continue operations.
10
During the year ended October 31, 2024, our total
revenue was $4,241, and we had a net loss of $2,230,222. During the year ended October 31, 2023, our total revenue was $13,000, and we
had a net loss of $1,927,494.
Our estimates of capital, personnel, equipment, and
facilities required for our proposed operations are based on certain other existing businesses operating under projected business conditions
and plans. We believe that our estimates are reasonable, but it is not possible to determine the accuracy of such estimates at this point.
In formulating our business plan, we have relied on the judgment of our officers and directors and their experience in developing businesses.
We can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing or implement successfully the business plan we have devised.
Further, even with sufficient financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our business on a profitable basis.
We can make no assurances that our projected business plan will be realized or that any of our assumptions will prove to be correct.
We are subject to a variety
of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. Some of these risks relate to
general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the carbon emissions industry in which we operate.
The following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. The risks described below may not be
the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative
impact on our business operations or financial condition.
We operate in a highly
competitive industry.
The climate and carbon treatment
business is highly competitive and constantly changing. Our competitors include not only other large multinational companies, but also
smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants.
Competitive challenges also
arise from rapidly-evolving and new technologies in the carbon capture space, creating opportunities for new and existing competitors
and a need for continued significant investment in research and development.
A number of our existing or potential competitors
may have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger investor bases, greater name recognition, and more
established relationships with their investors, and more established sources of deal flow and investment opportunities than we do. This
may enable our competitors to: develop and expand their services and develop infrastructure more quickly and achieve greater scale and
cost efficiencies; adapt more quickly to new or emerging markets and opportunities, strategies, techniques, technologies, and changing
investor needs; take advantage of acquisitions and other market opportunities more readily; establish operations in new markets more rapidly;
devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and provide
clients with additional benefits at lower overall costs in order to gain market share. If our competitive advantages are not compelling
or sustainable and we are not able to effectively compete with larger competitors, then we may not be able to increase or sustain cash
flow.
We will need to raise funding, which may not
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate
our product development efforts or other operations.
We will need to seek funds soon, through public or
private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations,
strategic alliances or a combination of these approaches. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges.
It is not certain that we have accounted for all costs and expenses of future development and regulatory compliance. Even if we believe
we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable
or if we have specific strategic considerations.
Our future growth may be limited.
Our ability to achieve our expansion objectives and
to manage our growth effectively depends upon a variety of factors, including our ability to further develop use of methodology, solutions
and systems, to attract and retain skilled employees, to successfully position and market the Company, to protect our existing intellectual
property, to capitalize on the potential opportunities we are pursuing with third parties, and sufficient funding. To accommodate growth
and compete effectively, we will need working capital to maintain adequate operating levels, develop additional procedures and controls
and increase, train, motivate and manage our work force. There is no assurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will
be adequate to support our potential future operations.
We rely on key personnel.
Our success also will depend in large part on the
continued service of our key operational and management personnel, including executive staff, research and development, engineering, marketing
and sales staff. We face intense competition from our competitors, customers and other companies throughout the industry. Any failure
on our part to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals could impair our business.

Our stockholders have
limited voting power compared to the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock.
Our Chairman, Donald Owens,
is the sole holder of our Series A Preferred Stock and, along with his ownership a substantial percentage of our Common Stock, controls
a majority of the voting power of our Company. For so long as Mr. Owens holds all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and a substantial
percentage of our Common Stock, he is expected to hold a majority of our outstanding voting power and he will control the outcome of matters
submitted to a stockholder vote, including the appointment of all directors of the Company.
Our management controls
all corporate activities and can approve all transactions, including mergers, without the approval of other stockholders.
Our Chairman, Donald Owens,
owns all of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that gives him the rights to 55 votes per share of our Company as well as is ownership
of a substantial percentage of our Common Stock. Other members of our management also own shares of our Common Stock. Therefore, our management
effectively controls all corporate activities and can approve transactions, including possible mergers, issuance of shares and compensation
levels, without the approval of other stockholders. The decisions of our management may not be consistent with or in the best interests
of other stockholders.
This capital structure may
have anti-takeover effects preventing a change in control transaction that the minority owners of our Common Stock might consider in their
best interest.
The ability of our
management to control our business may limit or eliminate minority stockholders’ ability to influence corporate affairs.
Our Chairman, Donald Owens,
owns all of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that gives him the rights to 55 votes per share of our Company as well as is ownership
of a substantial percentage of our Common Stock. Because of this beneficial stock ownership, Mr. Owens is in a position to continue to
elect our entire board of directors, decide all matters requiring stockholder approval, including potential mergers or business changes,
and determine our policies. The interests of our management may differ from the interests of our minority stockholders with respect to
the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of officers and directors and other business
decisions. Our minority stockholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our management. This level of control may also have an
adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our management may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs
that may result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and/or may sell sufficient numbers
of shares to significantly decrease our price per share.
We owe debt to a related party, which may be
convertible into a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock. If any or all of the notes are converted, shareholders would realize
substantial dilution.
As of March 20, 2025, we had entered into several
promissory notes with HNO Green Fuels, Inc., an entity controlled by our Chairman, Donald Owens, in the aggregate principal amount of
$1,440,000. Although none of these notes are currently convertible into shares of Common Stock of our Company, in the past, we have settled
a note that was in default for shares of Common Stock. If we are unable to pay each note, we may settle one or all of the notes for shares
of our Common Stock. In the event of a settlement or settlements of a note or notes for shares of our Common Stock, our shareholders would
realize substantial dilution and the value of their shares would decrease.
We may need to defend
ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and cause us to incur substantial costs.
Companies, organizations
or individuals, including our competitors, may own or obtain intellectual property or other proprietary rights that would prevent or limit
our ability to make, use, develop or sell our concept, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. We may receive
inquiries from intellectual property owners inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights.
Our business may be
adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties.
Failure to adequately protect
our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some
of our competitive advantage, and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition
and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core methodology and intellectual property.
To accomplish this, we will rely on a combination of intellectual property, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements, copyright, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect
our rights in our technology. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world.
12
Confidentiality agreements with employees and
others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
In order to protect our proprietary technology and
processes, we also rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outsource manufacturers and other advisors.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event
of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information.
Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain
or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.
We may not be successful in our potential business
combinations.
We may, in the future, pursue acquisitions of other
complementary businesses and technology licensing arrangements. We may also pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage
our core products and industry experience to expand our product offerings and geographic presence. We have limited experience with respect
to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to forming collaborations, strategic alliances and joint ventures.
If we were to make any acquisitions, we may not be
able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future
acquisitions we make, could also result in large and immediate write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of
which could harm our operating results. Integrating an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be
available for ongoing development of our existing business.
Any future indebtedness
reduces cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under debt obligations that we may incur in the future.
Payments of principal and
interest on borrowings that we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the business. Our level
of debt and the limitations imposed on us by debt agreements could have significant material and adverse consequences, including the following:
·
Our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;
·
We may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, or at all;
·
We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;
·
To the extent we borrow debt that bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;
·
To the extent we borrow debt that bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense; and
·
Our default under any loan with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.
If any one of these events
were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could
be materially and adversely affected.
Our results of operations are highly susceptible
to unfavorable economic conditions.
We are exposed to risks associated
with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets. The global economy continues to
be challenging in some markets. Uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions
or market sectors, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing
communication services. In addition, market conditions can be adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters,
severe weather events, military conflict or public health crises. Our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an
economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. In the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and
financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components
that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected
revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our
business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client
spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.
13
We may not be able
to meet our performance targets and milestones.
From time to time, we communicate
to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against
which to evaluate our performance. They should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. Our ability
to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance
on them.
Our management has limited personal liability.
Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws generally
provide that the liability of our officers and directors will be eliminated to the fullest extent allowed under law for their acts on
behalf of our Company.
It is possible investors may lose their entire
investment.
We will be reliant on the proceeds of this offering
to expand our operations. We may not be successful in implementing our business strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our
objectives. Our prospects for success must be considered in the context of a thinly capitalized company in a highly competitive market.
As a result, investors may lose their entire investment.
If we fail to establish and maintain an effective
system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report
and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.
Effective internal control is necessary for us to
provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be
able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with
investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical un-discovered
failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.
Public company compliance may make it more difficult
to attract and retain officers and directors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules
implemented by the SEC have required changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect
these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time-consuming and costly. As a
public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director
and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially
higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons
to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.
Risks Related to Our Market
We may be unable to
successfully execute and operate our green hydrogen production projects and such projects may cost more and take longer to complete than
we expect.
As part of our vertical integration
strategy, we are developing and constructing green hydrogen production facilities at locations across the United States and Canada. Our
ability to successfully complete and operate these projects is not guaranteed. These projects will impact our ability to meet and supplement
the hydrogen demands for our products and services, for both existing and prospective customers. Our hydrogen production projects are
dependent, in part, upon our ability to meet our internal demand for electrolyzers required for such projects. Electrolyzer demand by
external customers may concurrently affect our ability to meet the internal electrolyzer demand from our hydrogen production projects.
The timing and cost to complete the construction of our hydrogen production projects are subject to a number of factors outside of our
control and such projects may take longer and cost more to complete and become operational than we expect.
14
Furthermore, the viability
and competitiveness of our green hydrogen production facilities will depend, in part, upon favorable laws, regulations, and policies related
to hydrogen production. Some of these laws, regulations, policies are nascent, and there is no guarantee that they will be favorable to
our projects. Additionally, our facilities will be subject to numerous and new permitting, regulations, laws, and policies, many of which
might vary by jurisdiction. Hydrogen production facilities are also subject to robust competition from well-established multi-national
companies in the energy industry. There is no guarantee that our hydrogen production strategy will be successful, amidst this competitive
environment.
We will continue to
be dependent on certain third-party key suppliers for components in our products. The failure of a supplier to develop and supply components
in a timely manner or at all, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable
to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.
We rely on certain key suppliers
for critical components in our products, and there are numerous other components for our products that are sole sourced. If we fail to
maintain our relationships with our suppliers or build relationships with new suppliers, or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand,
we may be unable to manufacture our products, or our products may be available only at a higher cost or after a delay. In addition, to
the extent that our supply partners use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable
components from alternative sources. Furthermore, we may become increasingly subject to domestic content sourcing requirements and Buy
America preferences, as required under certain United States federal infrastructure funding sources. Domestic content preferences and
Buy America requirements potential mandate that we source certain components and materials from within the United States. Conformity with
these provisions potentially depends upon our ability to increasingly source components or certain materials from within the United States.
An inability to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully compete for certain projects
or awards utilizing federal funds subject to such mandates.
The failure of a supplier
to develop and supply components in a timely manner or at all, or to develop or supply components that meet our quality, quantity and
cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could
impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components
on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes.
Any such delays could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments or loss of revenue and market share, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our products and services
face intense competition.
The markets for energy products,
including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and hydrogen production are intensely competitive. Some of our competitors are much larger than
we are and may have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development, and commercialization of profitable,
commercially viable products more quickly and effectively than we can. There are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and
alternative energy generation in the United States and abroad, including, among others, major electric, oil, chemical, natural gas, battery,
generator and specialized electronics firms, as well as universities, research institutions and foreign government-sponsored companies.
These firms are engaged in forms of power generation such as advanced battery technologies, generator sets, fast charged technologies
and other types of fuel cell technologies. Well established companies might similarly seek to expand into new types of energy products,
including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. Additionally, some competitors may rely on other different competing
technologies for fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. We believe our technologies have many advantages. In the near future,
we expect the demand for these products – electrolyzers in particular – to largely offset any hypothetical market preference
for competing technologies. However, changes in customer preferences, the marketplace, or government policies could favor competing technologies.
The primary current value proposition for our fuel cell customers stems from productivity gains in using our solutions. Longer term, given
evolving market dynamics and changes in alternative energy tax credits, if we are unable to successfully develop future products that
are competitive with competing technologies in terms of price, reliability and longevity, customers may not buy our products. Technological
advances in alternative energy products, battery systems or other fuel cell, electrolyzer, or hydrogen technologies may make our products
less attractive or render them obsolete.
Risks Related to Financing Our Business
Expenses required to operate as a public company
will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations,
cash flow and financial condition.
Operating as a public company is more expensive than
operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations,
or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with SEC reporting
requirements. We anticipate that these costs will be approximately $200,000-$300,000 annually. Our failure to comply
with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial
condition.
15
Our growth depends on external sources of capital,
which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. In addition, investors, banks and other financial institutions may be reluctant
to enter into any lending or financial transactions with us, because we intend to enter into a mining excavation operation that could
have environmental impacts if not managed properly. If any of the source of funding is unavailable to us, our growth may be limited, and
our operating profit may be impaired.
We may not be in a position to take advantage of attractive
investment opportunities for growth if we are unable, due to global or regional economic uncertainty, changes in the provincial or federal
regulatory environment relating to the extraction, processing and distribution of our products or otherwise, to access capital markets
on a timely basis and on favorable terms or at all. Because we intend to grow our business, this limitation may require us to raise additional
equity or incur debt at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.
Our access to capital will depend upon several factors
over which we have little or no control, including general market conditions and the market’s perception of our current and potential
future earnings. If general economic instability or downturn leads to an inability to obtain capital to finance, the operation could be
negatively impacted. In addition, investors, banks and other financial institutions may be reluctant to enter into financing transactions
with us, because we intend to operate a mining excavation operation. If this source of funding is unavailable to us, our growth may be
limited.
Our ability to raise funding is subject to all the
above factors and will also be affected by our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. All these events would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Any future indebtedness reduces cash available
for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under debt obligations that we may incur in the future.
Payments of principal and interest on borrowings that
we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the business. Our level of debt and the limitations
imposed on us by debt agreements could have significant material and adverse consequences, including the following:
·
our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;
·
we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms;
·
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;
·
to the extent we borrow debt that bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;
·
we may default on our obligations or violate restrictive covenants; in which case the lenders may accelerate these debt obligations; and
·
default under any loan with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.
If any one of these events were to occur, our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be materially and adversely
affected.
Risks Related to Regulation
Applicable state and
international laws may prevent us from maximizing our potential income.
Depending on the laws of
each particular State, we may not be able to fully realize our potential to generate profit. Furthermore, cities and counties are being
given broad discretion to use other carbon capture methodologies. Depending on the laws of international countries and the States, we
might not be able to fully realize our potential to generate profit.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
16
Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice
requirements on brokers who deal in our shares that are penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them. This means that investors
may have difficulty reselling their shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline.
Our shares qualify as penny stocks and are covered
by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which imposes additional
sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. In particular, prior to
selling a penny stock, broker/dealers must give the prospective customer a risk disclosure document that: contains a description of the
nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a description of the
broker/dealers’ duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to violations of such
duties or other requirements of Federal securities laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
“bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask prices; contains
the toll free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions established pursuant to section 15(A)(i); defines significant terms
used in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and contains such other information, and is in such form
(including language, type size, and format), as the SEC requires by rule or regulation. Further, for sales of our securities, the broker/dealer
must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement before making a sale to you. Because of the imposition
of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that brokers will not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent
reselling of shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline.
Our stock may be traded infrequently and in
low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares.
Until our common stock is listed on a national securities
exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets,
or on another over-the-counter quotation system. In those venues, however, the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in
low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may
be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common
stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations,
various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and
accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may
further affect the liquidity of our common stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.
There currently is no active public market for
our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active public market will ever develop. Failure to develop or maintain a trading
market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.
There is currently no active public market for shares
of our common stock and one may never develop. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets is a thinly traded market
and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. We may not ever be able to
satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which is often a more widely-traded
and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded
and liquid market include the following: our stockholders’ equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities
may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able
to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and
markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common
stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains listed on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price
of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject
to increased volatility, making it difficult or impossible to sell shares of our common stock.
Our common stock is subject to the “penny
stock” rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and
may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.
Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the
definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than
$5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.  For any transaction involving
a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny
stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and
quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.
In order to approve a person’s account for transactions
in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b)
make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge
and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
17
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any
transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
(a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer
received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions
in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock
and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of
investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer
and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases
of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock
held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
Our stock price may be volatile.
The market price of our common stock is likely to
be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including
the following:
·
The continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants;
·
The impact of conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on our operations;
·
Geo-political events, such as the crisis in Ukraine, government responses to such events and the related impact on the economy both nationally and internationally;
·
Changes in our industry;
·
Competitive pricing pressures;
·
Our ability to obtain working capital financing;
·
Additions or departures of key personnel;
·
Sales of our common stock;
·
Our ability to execute our business plan;
·
Operating results that fall below expectations;
·
Loss of any strategic relationship;
·
Regulatory developments; and
·
Economic and other external factors.
In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time
experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market
fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Offers or availability for sale of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
18
If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our
common stock in the public market, including upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or issued upon the conversion
of preferred stock or exercise of warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an "overhang" and in anticipation
of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring,
also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the
future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.
Your percentage of ownership may become diluted
if we issue new Common Stock or other securities.
Our board of directors is authorized, without your
approval, to cause us to issue additional Common Stock to raise capital (including equity or debt securities convertible into Common Stock),
and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Any such issuance could
result in dilution of the equity of our shareholders.
We have many authorized but unissued shares
of our common stock.
We have a large number of authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock, which our management may issue without further stockholder approval, thereby causing dilution of your holdings
of our Common Stock. Our management will continue to have broad discretion to issue shares of our common stock in a range of transactions,
including capital-raising transactions, mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions, without obtaining stockholder approval, unless
stockholder approval is required. If our management determines to issue shares of our Common Stock from the large pool of authorized but
unissued shares for any purpose in the future, your ownership position would be diluted without your further ability to vote on that transaction.
The market valuation of our business may fluctuate
due to factors beyond our control and the value of your investment may fluctuate correspondingly.
The market valuation of companies, such as ours, frequently
fluctuates due to factors unrelated to the past or present operating performance of such companies. Our market valuation may fluctuate
significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
1.
Changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance, although there are currently no analysts covering our stock;
2.
Fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of companies such as ours;
3.
Changes in market valuations of similar companies;
4.
Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
5.
Variations in our quarterly operating results;
6.
Fluctuations in related labor cost; and
7.
Additions or departures of key personnel.
As a result, the value of your investment in us may
fluctuate.
We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock.
We have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock
and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Investors should not look to dividends as a source of income.
In the interest of reinvesting initial profits back
into our business, we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any economic return will initially
be derived, if at all, from appreciation in the fair market value of our stock, and not as a result of dividend payments.

in Murrieta, California, and are in the process of establishing a location in Houston, Texas, to support our Scalable Green Hydrogen Production
farms.
We believe these facilities are sufficient to meet
our current and near-term future operational needs.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation
relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently involved in any pending legal
proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are
a party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results.

Holders of Our Common Stock
As of March 20, 2025, there were approximately 691
stockholders of record. Because shares of our Common Stock are held by depositaries, brokers and other nominees, the number of beneficial
holders of our shares is substantially larger than the number of stockholders of record.
Dividends
We have not
declared or paid dividends on shares of our common stock and we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on shares of our common stock
for the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business. Our future
dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, if any, our financial
condition, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion
and analysis may include statements regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources.
Such statements, along with any other non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements
are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC''). We do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our actual results
may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements contained herein.
Overview
HNO focuses on systems engineering design, integration,
and product development to generate green hydrogen-based clean energy solutions to help businesses and communities decarbonize in the
near term.
24
HNO stands for “Hydrogen” and “Oxygen”
and our experienced management team has over 14 years of expertise in the green hydrogen production industry.
We provide green hydrogen systems engineering design,
integration, and products to multiple markets, which include: (i) the zero-emission vehicle and mobile equipment market consisting of
hydrogen fuel cell electric passenger vehicles, material handling equipment such as forklifts and airport ground support equipment, as
well as the medium and heavy-duty truck market; (ii) the current and emerging hydrogen gas markets encompassing ammonia, fertilizer, steel,
mining, electronics, semiconductors, and fuel cell electric vehicles; (iii) and the gasoline and diesel engine emissions and maintenance
reduction product and services market.
On
May 16, 2023, the Company began accepting subscription agreements from investors as part of an offering under Regulation A. This offering
concluded automatically on May 5, 2024. During this period, the Company issued 2,459,961 shares of common stock under the Regulation
A offering.
Results of Operations
For the Years Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023
Revenues - For the year ended October 31, 2024,
revenue generated from hydrogen engineering services and combustion solutions was $4,241 compared to $13,000 for the year ended October
31, 2023. The decrease in revenues of $8,759 is mainly attributable to our inability to secure additional contracts for hydrogen engineering
services and combustion solutions during the current year.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profits – For
the year ended October 31, 2024, our cost of goods sold was $3,688, resulting in a gross profit of $553. In comparison, for the year ended
October 31, 2023, our cost of goods sold was $5,885, resulting in a gross profit of $7,115. The cost of goods sold consisted of expenses
related to contract labor associated with revenue generation.
Operating Expenses
General and administrative
expenses increased by $151,393, primarily due to higher professional fees and administrative costs incurred during 2024. These increases
were partially offset by a $405,812 decrease in share-based compensation, which declined from $489,800 in 2023 (related to 2,025,000
shares issued) to $83,988 in 2024 (related to 7,400,000 shares issued). The reduction in share-based compensation was primarily due to
a lower fair value per share resulting from a decrease in the Company’s stock price.
Advertising and
marketing expenses increased by $4,408 due to expanded outreach and promotional activities supporting product development and brand awareness.
Depreciation
expense increased by $118,033, reflecting depreciation on property and equipment additions. Additionally, amortization expense of $24,699
was recognized in 2024 related to the CHRS intellectual property. There was no corresponding amortization expense in the prior year.
Net Loss -
Net loss for the year ended October 31, 2024, was $2,230,222 compared to a net loss of $1,927,494 during the same period in 2023.
This increase in net loss is primarily due to the significant rise in operating expenses during the year, as well as the decline in revenues.
Forward-Looking Considerations
The Company recognizes the possibility of future increases
in labor or material costs. Factors such as evolving market conditions, potential inflation, and global economic dynamics are considered.
We are actively monitoring these aspects to anticipate and navigate any forthcoming rises in labor or material expenses.
Cost-to-Revenue - The Company is assessing
alterations in the relationship between cost of sales and revenue. We are examining the factors influencing these changes, including shifts
in prices and fluctuations in the volume of services sold. Understanding the impact of these elements is crucial for maintaining a balanced
and effective cost-to-revenue structure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the Years Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023
Our cash balance of $20,255 as of October 31, 2024,
combined with the current level of revenues, is insufficient to maintain operations. Therefore, we will need to raise additional funds
in the near future to support our operations and growth plans. Our cash balance on October 31, 2023, was $235,159, reflecting a decrease
of $214,904 over the year. This decrease is attributable to significant cash outflows related to operating and investing activities.
We have not been able to generate sufficient cash
from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations and have relied primarily on raising capital through sales of common stock, Regulation
A offerings, and related party loans.
As of October 31, 2024, the Company had capitalized
approximately $941,280 in capital expenditures related to equipment purchases for its first hydrogen production site in Katy, Texas.
Operations at this location are scheduled to commence in August 2025, with anticipated revenues of approximately $2,500,000 over the
subsequent 15-20 months.
The Company has also identified potential expansion
plans to evaluate approximately 2 additional production sites. These expansion plans remain preliminary and are not subject to binding
agreements or contractual commitments. If fully implemented, these expansion plans could require estimated capital expenditures of approximately
$8,000,000 over the next 15-20 months and could generate between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in revenue over the same period.
The Company anticipates funding these capital
expenditures and related operating expenses through a combination of existing cash resources, proceeds from potential future equity or
debt financings, Regulation A offerings, and other strategic funding arrangements. As of the filing date, the Company has no binding
commitments for such financing.
25
The impact of existing or probable government regulations
on our business remains uncertain. Due to the nature of our operations in hydrogen-based clean energy technologies, it is anticipated
that government regulation may increase in the future, potentially requiring corrective actions or changes to our business model.
There are currently no external sources of liquidity
available to us, other than potential equity financing or debt offerings. Failure to secure additional funding could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations.

Cash Used in Operating Activities
During the year ended October 31, 2024, cash used
in operating activities was $1,802,678. This reflects our net losses for the period, adjusted by non-cash charges such as depreciation
and share-based compensation. Changes in working capital accounts also contributed to cash usage, primarily due to increases in accounts
payable and decreases in payroll taxes and accrued interest payable.
In comparison, during the year ended October 31, 2023,
cash used in operating activities was $1,334,084. The increase in cash usage in 2024 is attributable to higher operating expenses, including
costs related to expanding operations, share based compensation and increased depreciation expenses.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the year ended October 31, 2024, cash provided
by financing activities was $2,002,612. This primarily consisted of proceeds from related party advances totaling $960,585, along with
$958,929 raised through the Company's Regulation A offering and proceeds from security deposits.
In comparison, during the year ended October 31, 2023,
cash provided by financing activities was $2,426,833, primarily reflecting proceeds from the Company’s Regulation A offering and
related party loans.
Cash Provided by Investing Activities
During the year ended October 31, 2024, cash used
in investing activities was $414,838, primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment and additional investments in intellectual
property classified as long-term assets.
For the year ended October 31, 2023, cash used in
investing activities was $908,699, which included significant purchases of property and equipment as well as investments in a SAFE agreement.
Going Concern
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. During the year ended October 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $2,230,222 and used cash in operating activities of $1,802,678.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and the classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements with any
party.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation
of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’
estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which
such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management
believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Donald
Owens, Chairman of the Board of Directors
and
Stockholders of HNO International, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of HNO International, Inc. (the Company) as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Going
Concern
As
described in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover operating
costs. The Company has recurring net losses and is in a negative working capital position. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient
funding, it may struggle to reach its future obligations.
Accordingly,
the Company has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of one year from the date these financial statements are issued.
Management
plans to identify adequate sources of funding to provide operating capital for continued growth. Auditing the Company’s assessment
and related disclosures regarding its ability to continue as a going concern required significant auditor judgment. This is due to the
high level of uncertainty surrounding the projections and assumptions related to the timing and likelihood of future cash flows, including
external funding. Assessing whether the Company’s disclosures adequately reflect the uncertainty and risks associated with its
going concern status also demanded considerable auditor judgment and effort.
F-2
Valuation
of Service Stock
As
described in Note 2, the Company undervalued its stock-based compensation of approximately $486,000 during the year ended October 31,
2023, which resulted in a restatement.
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 Compensation
- Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The Company does not adhere to a formal stock-based compensation plan; rather, it issues
stock awards on a discretionary basis as part of compensation agreements with selected consultants and employees. Compensation for stock-based
awards is recognized as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The expense associated with these awards is recorded based on the
fair value on the date of grant, as determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.
The
valuation of stock-based compensation requires management to make significant estimates, particularly in determining the volatility of
the company’s stock price, the expected term of options, and the risk-free interest rate. These assumptions are subject to change
and can materially impact the amount of compensation expense recognized.
Other
Matters
As
described in Note 2, the Company identified misstatements with respect to certain accounting errors relating to the valuation of service
stock issued, the termination of a patent agreement entered into on January 23, 2023 and the under accrual of accounts payable during
the year ended October 31, 2023.
We
have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.

HNO INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2024
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
Organization
HNO International, Inc. (the “Company”)
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 2, 2005 under the name American Bonanza Resources Limited. On August 4, 2009, the Company
acquired Clenergen Corporation Limited (UK), a United Kingdom corporation (“Limited”), and succeeded to the business of Limited.
Limited acquired the assets of Rootchange Limited, a biofuel and biomass research and development company, in April 2009. On March 19,
2009, the Company changes its name to Clenergen Corporation. On July 8, 2020, the Company changed its name to Excoin Ltd. and on August
31, 2021, the Company changed its name to HNO International, Inc. its current name.
The Company specializes in the design, integration,
and development of green hydrogen-based clean energy technologies. With the Company’s management having over 13 years of experience
in the field of green hydrogen production, the Company is committed to providing scalable products that help businesses and communities
decarbonize, reduce emissions, and cut operational costs. HNO stands for Hydrogen and Oxygen. The Company is at the forefront of developing
innovative solutions, such as the Compact Hydrogen Refueling System (CHRS) and the Compact Hydrogen Production System (CHPS), which can
be used to produce green hydrogen for various applications including fuel cell electric vehicles, hydrogen internal combustion engines,
heating, and cooking. The CHPS is highly scalable, capable of producing 100-2,000 (or more) kilograms of hydrogen per day for commercial
use in various applications. In addition, the Company develops energy systems that complement the zero-emissions EV infrastructure, reduce
harmful emissions, and cut maintenance costs of commercial diesel fleets. By integrating components from leading industry partners, the
Company aims to transition fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives and promote lower emissions.
NOTE 2 – CORRECTION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In connection with the Company’s
re-audit of the Company’s financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2023, the Company’s management identified corrections
to the valuation of service stock issued during the year ended October 31, 2023 and the termination of the patent agreement entered into
on January 24, 2023.   The corrections made are summarized as follows:
1.Stock Price Valuation Adjustment: The valuation of the stock price was adjusted from $0.001 to $0.23.
2.Share-Based Compensation: There was an increase in share-based compensation reflecting the revised valuation
of stock.
3.Equity Adjustments: There was a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital and an adjustment
in the accumulated deficit to reflect the revised stock valuation.
4.Termination
of Patent Purchase Agreement: On March 13, 2025, the Company and Donald Owens mutually agreed
to terminate the Patent Purchase Agreement as of January 24, 2023. As part of the termination,
the patents were returned to Mr. Owens, and the 5,000,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were canceled. The $82,500
value previously reported in intangible assets and additional
paid-in capital was reversed, resulting in a reduction in intangible assets. Additionally,
the related amortization expense of $3,176
and the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock were removed from
the financial statements. A copy of the Termination Agreement was attached to the Company’s
Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.27.
5.Expenses totaling $21,560, incurred during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, and paid subsequently,
have been reclassified to accounts payable as of October 31, 2023. This adjustment ensures that financial obligations are accurately reported
in the period in which they were incurred.
Impact of the Restatement
The impact of the restatement on the financial statements for
the affected period is presented below. In addition to the below, the related notes to the financial statements have also been adjusted
as appropriate to reflect the impact of the restatements.
The impact of the restatement on the line items within the previously reported

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company for the years ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The management makes its best estimate of the outcome for these items based on information
available when the financial statements are prepared.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023, the Company did
not hold any investments that qualify as cash equivalents. Therefore, the cash and cash equivalents line item in the balance sheet solely
comprises cash.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”).
ASC 718 requires that the cost of equity instrument awards, issued in exchange for services, including those issued to employees and
predominantly to consultants, be measured at the grant-date fair value. The Company does not adhere to a formal stock-based compensation
plan; rather, it issues stock awards on a discretionary basis as part of compensation agreements with selected consultants and employees.
Compensation for stock-based awards is recognized as a non-cash expense on the income statement. The expense associated with these awards
is recorded based on the fair value on the date of grant, as determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. This cost
is recognized over the period during which the award recipient is required to perform services, typically known as the vesting period.
The total compensation cost related to vested stock-based awards is recognized after adjusting for estimated forfeitures at the time
of vesting. The expense related to stock-based compensation is included within the same income statement lines as cash compensation for
the consultants and employees who receive the awards, currently included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of
operations as the Company does not allocate compensation costs to COGS. As of the report date, the Company has not established any
plans to issue dividends on stock-based awards. Any tax benefits arising from deductions for these awards are recorded in additional
paid-in capital, provided they exceed the cumulative compensation cost recognized.
F-12
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation
allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes
identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price,
allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance
obligation.
During the years ended October
31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had revenue of $4,241 and $13,000. Revenue was recognized from hydrogen engineering services and combustion
solutions.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share
Basic loss per common share is computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for each period. Diluted loss per share is
computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average.
Number of shares of common stock outstanding
plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the common stock equivalents. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost and, less
accumulated depreciation. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized.
When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or
losses are included in income in the year of disposal. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of property and
equipment when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.
The Company’s property and equipment mainly
consists of computer and laser equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.
Schedule of estimated useful lives
Useful life
Small equipment
3 Years
Large equipment
7 Years
Vehicles
4 Years
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
To determine recoverability of a long-lived asset, management evaluates whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows
from the asset are less than its carrying amount. If impairment is indicated, the long-lived asset would be written down to fair
value. Fair value is determined by an evaluation of available price information at which assets could be bought or sold, including
quoted market prices, if available, or the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable
assumptions.
F-13
Leases
The Company accounts for leases in accordance
with ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease.
Where the Company is the lessee, for each lease with a term greater than twelve months, the Company records a right-of-use asset and lease
liability. A right-of-use asset represents the economic benefit conveyed to the Company by the right to use the underlying asset over
the lease term. A lease liability represents the obligation to make lease payments arising from the use of the asset over the lease term.
As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the lease liability is calculated at lease commencement
as the present value of unpaid lease payments using the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing
rate represents the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized
basis over a similar term and is determined using a portfolio approach based on information available at the commencement date of the
lease. Leases with an initial expected term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Balance Sheet and the related lease expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2024-01, "Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and
Similar Awards." This update clarifies the accounting for profits interest awards by specifying when these awards should be accounted
for under ASC 718, Stock Compensation, as opposed to other compensation arrangements like cash bonuses under ASC 710. This clarification
is provided through a series of illustrative examples which show how to determine whether profits interest awards meet the conditions
of ASC 718, focusing on when such awards should be recognized as equity or liability. The guidance is intended to increase the comparability
and consistency of financial reporting by providing clearer criteria for the accounting of profits interest awards.
For public companies, the amendments in this update
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For private companies,
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its
financial statements and will continue to assess its potential effects as the adoption date approaches.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates as one reportable segment.
The Chief Executive Officer, who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined under ASC 280, manages and evaluates the Company’s
operations and performance on a consolidated basis. The Company’s operations are focused on the design, development, manufacturing,
and sale of integrated green hydrogen-based products and related services.
The Company offers multiple products, including the Compact Hydrogen
Refueling Station (CHRS), Hydrogen Carbon Cleaner (HCC), and Scalable Hydrogen Energy Platform (SHEP). These products share common technologies,
production processes, customer markets, and distribution channels. Financial information is not prepared or reviewed separately for these
product lines for resource allocation or performance evaluation purposes. As such, management has determined that the Company has one
operating and reportable segment.
NOTE 4 – GOING CONCERN
On October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit
of $44,326,326. We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. We will be
required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships, or other arrangements
until we are able to raise revenues to a point of positive cash flow. We are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements
to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including obtaining loans and selling common stock. There
is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough revenue and/or raise capital to support operations.
Based on the above factors, substantial doubt exists
about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements.

NOTE 6 – LEASES
Operating leases
The Company has an operating lease agreement for office space in Murrieta,
California, expiring on November 30, 2026.
On November 18, 2020, the Company entered into an
operating lease with the landlord, Demarius Holdings, Inc., commencing on December 1, 2020, and ending on November 30, 2023, for the office
spaces located at 41558 Eastman Drive, Suites B and C, Murrieta, California 92562. The monthly rent was $4,183. Both suites are approximately
2,088 square feet of space. The Company’s principal executive office is located at 41558 Eastman Drive, Suite B, Murrieta, California
92562. Suite C is utilized for testing and research equipment.
On November 14, 2023, the lease for Suite B was extended
for 36 months to November 30, 2026. The monthly rental amount for Suite B is $2,501 for the period from December 1, 2023, to November
30, 2024, with an increase to $2,573 for the period from December 1, 2024, to November 30, 2025, and an increase to $2,647 for the period
from December 1, 2025, to November 30, 2026.
On January 4, 2024, the lease for Suite C was extended
for 34 months to November 30, 2026. The monthly rental amount for Suite C is $2,434 for the period from February 1, 2024, to November
30, 2024, with an increase to $2,506 for the period from December 1, 2024, to November 30, 2025, and an increase to $2,555 for the period
from December 1, 2025, to November 30, 2026.
The Company has active operating lease arrangements
for office space. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments relating to its right to use the underlying leased
assets. The Company was required to classify such leases as operating leases in accordance with the provisions of ASC 842.
Therefore, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities with corresponding Right-Of-Use ("ROU") assets
based on the present value of the minimum rental payments of such leases.
As most of the Company’s leases do not provide
an implicit interest rate, the lease liability is calculated at lease commencement as the present value of unpaid lease payments using
the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that the Company
would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and is determined using
a portfolio approach based on information available at the commencement date of the lease. As of October 31, 2024, the right-of-use asset
was $121,805 and operating lease liabilities were $123,217. The operating lease liabilities consist of a current portion of $57,062 and
a non-current portion of $66,155. The weighted average remaining lease term was 2.08 years and the weighted average discount rate was
4.14%.
Operating Cash Flows Related to Leases
During the year ended October 31, 2024, the Company
made cash payments totaling $1,412 related to its operating leases. These payments are included in the Statement of Cash Flows under operating
activities as "Payments of lease liabilities."

NOTE 11 – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: PROTOTYPE COMPACT HYDROGEN REFUELING
STATION (CHRS)
On July 10, 2023, the Company entered into a Simple
Agreement for Future Equity (the “SAFE”) with Varea, Inc. ("Varea"), a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the SAFE,
the Company is investing $500,000 (the "Purchase Amount") in Varea in exchange for the right to certain shares of Varea's Capital
Stock. The agreement specifies that the Purchase Amount will be used for the Company's business operations over the next 12 months, subject
to an agreed-upon budget.
Prior to entering into this SAFE, the Company had
an existing financial arrangement with Varea LLC, whereby Varea LLC invoiced the Company for services rendered, which were recorded as
expenses by HNOI. However, recognizing the potential for a more mutually beneficial arrangement, Varea Inc. proposed a revised approach.
Under the newly proposed approach, Varea Inc. would submit a detailed budget outlining their anticipated monthly expenses, and HNO International,
Inc. would view these expenses as an investment opportunity rather than mere costs. In exchange for funding Varea Inc.'s expenses, HNO
International, Inc. would receive a post-money SAFE, which represents a future right to certain shares of Varea's Capital Stock. The transition
from the previous invoicing system to the investment-based financial arrangement was agreed by both parties. The terms and conditions
of the agreement, including the conversion of expenses into a potential future return on investment, were thoroughly assessed and discussed.
On December 6, 2023, the SAFE was terminated as part
of a Mutual Release Agreement between HNO International, Inc., and Varea, Inc. Under the terms of this Mutual Release Agreement, the intellectual
property related to the prototype Compact Hydrogen Refueling Station (CHRS), developed with the funds provided under the SAFE, was retained
by HNO International, Inc.
The balance of the SAFE on December 6, 2023, and October
31, 2023, was $136,725 and $103,821, respectively. Following the termination of the SAFE, the amount previously recorded under the SAFE
was reclassified, and the intellectual property associated with the CHRS is now fully owned and recognized as a long-term intangible asset
on HNO International, Inc.'s balance sheet. This long-term asset is solely the intellectual property associated with the CHRS and does
not include any physical equipment.
Amortization
The intellectual property associated with the
CHRS is being amortized over a useful life of five
5 years, beginning on December 6, 2023. The amortization expense for the year ended October 31, 2024 is $24,699,
recognizing the straight-line amortization of the asset over the remaining useful life.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report, being October 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer (who serves as our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer).
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer (who serves as our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Treasurer (who serves as our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), we have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report for the reasons discussed below.
MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-2013). As
a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of October 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative
of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC
guidelines.
Our management has concluded that in light of the
accounting errors described in Note 2 to the notes to the financial statements included herein, a material weakness exists in our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of October 31, 2023 at a reasonable assurance level.
We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design
of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able
to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during
our fiscal year ending October 31, 2025: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective
risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts
set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required.
If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section
989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting, which are included within disclosure controls and procedures, that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.

“Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as such terms are defined in Item

Under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the above table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on the date of this report.

Director Independence
We use the definition of “independence”
of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an “independent director”
is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company’s Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The
NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:
·
the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the Company;
·
the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exemptions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);
·
the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exemptions;
·
the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or
·
the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company’s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the Company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.
Under such definitions, we have no independent directors.
However, our Common Stock is not currently quoted or listed on any national exchange or interdealer quotation system with a requirement
that a majority of our Board be independent and, therefore, we are not subject to any director independence requirements.

Pre-Approval Policies
The Board's policy is to pre-approve all audit services
and all non-audit services before they commence, including the fees and terms thereof, to be provided by our independent auditor. All
of the services provided during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024 were pre-approved. No audit, review or attest services were approved
in accordance with Section 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024.
During the approval process, the Board
considered the impact of the types of services and the related fees on the independence of the independent registered public
accounting firm. The services and fees were deemed compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence, including compliance
with rules and regulations of the SEC. Throughout the year, the Board will review any revisions to the estimates of audit fees
initially estimated for the engagement.
