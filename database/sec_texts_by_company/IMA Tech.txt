ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
IMA Tech (“the
Company”) was formed on March 29, 2023 in the State of Wyoming. The primary focus of the Company is on the development and deployment
of digital avatars. Utilizing advanced technology, the Company creates a unique blend of human intelligence, artificial intelligence,
and niche databases. Digital avatars can be customized to meet specific business requirements and are applicable across various industries
online.
The Company’s core objective is
to provide customers with a more immersive experience by simplifying the process of fulfilling their requests using AI-driven avatars.
The use of avatars reduces costs and saves time for implementation, as the human mind processes information faster in an audiovisual format
than in text. Additionally, digital avatars are capable of serving customers remotely without losing the sense of personal attention and
human presence. The avatars can serve multiple consumers simultaneously, enhancing a company's operational efficiency and marketing effectiveness.
We provide services to various industries,
including education, marketing, banking, and science, among others, benefiting a wide range of businesses and individuals.
We aim to target two groups: students
and business professionals. We understand that these two groups have different needs and requirements, which is why we have designed our
services to meet the unique demands of each. Our services are also useful for learning, for example, by providing visualizations and audio
accompaniment through an avatar that can assist students in achieving their goals.
Business professionals can also find our
services suitable. We understand that businesses face many challenges in today's competitive landscape, so we aim to provide practical
solutions to help businesses achieve their objectives.
Businesses that can derive value from
our website are those that necessitate personalized and interactive consultation services. Examples of such businesses include:
·Virtual Consultancy Service
We intend to create a platform
where clients can access digital avatars specialized in different fields.
4
·Consulting Company
With our services, a consulting company
can analyze trends, identify client needs, and personalize services further. The avatars can adapt their responses and recommendations
based on individual client profiles.
Digital avatars offer scalability advantages
as multiple clients can interact with different avatars simultaneously. The website can also ensure 24/7 availability, enabling clients
to access consultations at their convenience, irrespective of time zones.
The digital avatars'
ability to provide personalized content allows users to delve deeper into the desired topics and services, leading to increased customer
satisfaction. By leveraging AI technologies and a vast array of information from the database, the company can accurately target the interests
of the audience through the digital avatar. This targeted marketing approach leads to improved business operations, enhanced customer
experiences, and increased competitiveness in the market.
Our company has initiated its operations
with the launch of a website (https://ima.gg) on April 1, 2024. This platform serves as an online facility for disseminating information
about our business activities and sharing updates on our latest developments. Through our website, users can experience our cutting-edge
avatar technology via API, enabling them to generate videos and download them. Avatars can communicate in up to 40 languages depending
on the user’s preference.
Our avatar technology is designed to revolutionize
the way people interact with digital content, providing them with a more immersive and engaging experience. By leveraging our proprietary
algorithms and advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to create highly realistic and customizable avatars that can be used in a
wide range of applications, from virtual assistants and customer service bots to gaming and entertainment.
Through our website, users can
explore the full potential of our avatar technology, learning about its features and capabilities and experimenting with different
settings and configurations. After selecting a pricing plan, they gain full access to the platform. This access allows them to
register, log in to their account, and easily create videos by tapping the "Create Video" button. Users can customize
their videos with various platform features, including background color, aspect ratio, avatar appearance, and an extensive voice
library. This library offers options for language, gender, and additional filters such as age and style, ensuring a personalized and
unique experience. Avatars can be integrated into various forms of content such as blogs, podcasts, and social media presents a
multitude of opportunities for imaginative and innovative expression. This utilization of avatars offers endless possibilities for
creativity and innovation.
5
In the future, we envision expanding our
website and incorporating more advanced technologies to broaden the range of possibilities for avatars, simplifying and improving the
process of creating educational and business materials, making them more engaging, professional, and personalized. We plan to introduce
news and updates about our company on the website, providing users with insights into our ongoing research, as well as our plans for future
expansion.
With the introduction of full customization,
avatars will be able to demonstrate various processes and instructions, simplifying the process of perception and memorization of ideas.
Our goal is to revolutionize the way people
interact with digital content, providing them with a more immersive and engaging experience. By leveraging the latest advancements in
artificial intelligence and machine learning, we are confident that we can create avatars that are not only highly realistic but also
highly adaptable to the needs and preferences of individual users.
At the heart of our business is a commitment
to innovation and excellence, and we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of avatar technology. With
our website and API, we aim to empower users around the world to harness the power of this exciting new technology and unlock its full
potential. We believe that our website has the potential to transform the way people learn, work, and communicate in the digital age.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
As
a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not required to include the disclosure under this Item 1A. Risk Factors. Despite the fact
that we are not required to provide risk factors, we consider the following factors to be risks to our continued growth and development:
We are at a very early operational
stage and our business is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new venture.
Our business strategy is in its early
stages and as a new venture, we are subject to all the risks associated with establishing a new business. There is a risk that our intended
business and operations may not be successful, or may take a significant amount of time to achieve success.
The success of our business will depend
on a multitude of factors, some of which may be beyond our control or cannot be predicted currently. These factors may include changes
in market conditions, competition, regulatory changes, and general economic conditions. Any of these factors could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, business prospects, operations, and the value of an investment in the Company.
We may be unable to raise the additional
capital needed to grow our business.
The Company may require additional
capital to finance its growth and expansion plans, and there is a risk that it may not be able to secure the necessary funding. The Company's
ability to access funding may depend on several factors, including its financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.
8
In the event that the Company
is unable to secure additional funding, it may face limitations in its ability to expand its operations, develop new products, or enter
new markets. This could negatively impact our growth prospects and our ability to compete with other players in the industry.
We face intense
industry competition.
The
Company operates in a highly competitive market, and there is no guarantee that its technology will be able to compete effectively against
existing or new competitors. This could adversely affect its market share and revenue growth prospects. Among our competitors are “Humanizing
Technologies”, “Creaitor.ai” and “Synthesys”.
Strong
competition in the market may require us to lower our prices, increase our sales and marketing expenses or otherwise invest greater resources
to maintain or gain market share as needed to adequately compete. Such efforts may negatively impact our profitability. If the Company
is unable to effectively adapt to changes or developments in the competitive landscape, our business, financial conditions and results
of operations may be adversely affected.
In
terms of market familiarity and understanding, the concept of digital avatars and their potential benefits could be new to many companies
and industries.
The
concept of digital avatars and their potential benefits may be new to many businesses and industries, posing a risk in terms of market
familiarity and understanding. This lack of widespread knowledge can impede adoption rates and result in resistance from potential clients.
Potential
clients may not fully grasp the value proposition and benefits of digital avatars for their specific business requirements due to the
novelty of the technology. This can lead to slower adoption rates and reluctance to invest in digital avatar solutions. Limited market
familiarity can also give rise to skepticism and concerns about reliability and integration challenges. Lack of understanding may prompt
businesses to opt for traditional solutions instead, hindering the market penetration of digital avatars.
Overall,
the risk associated with market familiarity and understanding highlights the need for ongoing education and awareness initiatives, as
well as continuous monitoring of the market landscape to adapt strategies accordingly.
The
failure to develop and maintain our digital avatars could negatively impact our ability to ensure optimal performance.
Developing
and maintaining digital avatars entails significant technical challenges and ongoing updates to ensure optimal performance. The Company
must possess advanced technology infrastructure capable of handling the processing and rendering of avatars in real-time. Insufficient
or outdated infrastructure may lead to system failures, security breaches, and limitations in natural language processing capabilities,
which can adversely affect the reliability and functionality of digital avatars. Such disruptions or negative experiences have the potential
to result in client loss and reputational damage.
9
Regular
updates and maintenance are essential to keep digital avatars up to date with advancements in technology, improved natural language processing
capabilities, and enhanced security measures. Failure to perform timely updates and maintenance tasks can lead to compatibility issues,
security vulnerabilities, and reduced functionality, thereby impacting user satisfaction and damaging the company's reputation. The dynamic
and rapidly evolving nature of the digital avatar landscape necessitates a proactive approach to address technical challenges and limitations.
System
failures, downtime, and security breaches pose additional risks. Technical infrastructure is susceptible to failures due to hardware malfunctions,
software bugs, or network outages.
Such
disruptions can render digital avatars inaccessible or result in degraded performance, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential client
loss. Protecting user data from security breaches is crucial, as any unauthorized access or compromise can have severe consequences, including
reputational damage, legal repercussions, and client attrition.
If we fail to effectively
manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.
Our Company is on a development stage and is a subject
to the strains of ongoing development and growth, which will place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial
infrastructure. Further, we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial,
operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results would be materially harmed.
We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which
could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Although we cannot provide any assurance that
we will successfully identify emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on opportunities.
The longevity of our business depends
in part on our ability to enhance and sell the functionality of our current solutions to remain competitive and meet customer needs.
The longevity and sustained success of
our business are contingent upon our ability to continuously enhance and effectively market the functionality of our solutions. The competitive
landscape in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological advancements and evolving customer needs. Failure to adapt to these
changes and deliver innovative, feature-rich offerings may result in a loss of market share and competitiveness.
Addressing the risk associated with the
development of our website requires ongoing investment in research and development, collaboration with industry partners, and a proactive
approach to monitoring market trends and customer preferences. We must also allocate sufficient resources and talent to ensure timely
development, rigorous testing, and successful implementation of new features and functionalities.

Failure to develop our website to remain
competitive and meet customer needs may adversely affect our business prospects, financial performance, and long-term sustainability.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with (i) our audited financial statement as of April 30, 2025, that
appear elsewhere in this filing. This filing contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ
materially from those discussed herein. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward- looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of any revisions
of the forward -looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. For information regarding risk factors that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to the Risk Factors section of this filing beginning on page 8.
Going Concern
The future of our Company is dependent
upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of products and services through our websites.
Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its Common Stock, if necessary. Our
auditors have expressed a going concern opinion which raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2025, the Company had
$9,400 in current assets, compared to $7,732 as of April 30, 2024. The Company’s liabilities stood at $267,297 as of April 30, 2025,
a decrease of $28,836 from the previous year. The accumulated deficit was $82,937 as of April 30, 2025, an increase of $55,071 since April
30, 2024.
For the year ended April 30, 2025, the
Company used $89,744 in cash for operating activities, compared to $75,419 of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended
April 30, 2024. For the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company didn't use cash in investing activities, while for the year ended April
30, 2024, the Company used cash in investing activities in the amount of $271,238 for the purchase of intangible assets. Additionally,
the Company received $86,512 in cash financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2025, compared to $187,551 in the previous year,
mostly due to proceeds from loans from related parties and proceeds from the sale of common stock.
12
The Company is expected to
continue to generate revenue from operations in the coming year; however, there can be no assurance that this will happen. The Company
relies solely on financing provided by loans from Liliia Havrykh, our President, pursuant to the Credit Agreement between IMA Tech and
Ms. Havrykh dated March 29, 2023, as amended on December 22, 2023, April 1, 2024, and December 16, 2024. The loans will also be used to
fund the Company’s operations and will be disbursed “as needed.” The aggregate amount of such funds shall not exceed
$300,000. We believe that such loans will be sufficient for us to continue operating for the next 12 months. The Company will repay the
amounts lent to the President from the revenues it receives.
As
the Company’s expenses are relatively stable, unless additional websites are
rolled out, the Company believes it can continue its present operations with projected revenues together with proceeds from a private
offering. The Company will consider raising additional funds through sales of equity, debt and convertible securities, if it is deemed
necessary. The Company has no intention in investing in short-term or long-term discretionary financial programs of any kind.
Results of Operations
Total revenue for the year ended April
30, 2025 was $55,374 and $10,800 was generated for the year ended April 30, 2024.
Total expenses for the year ended April
30, 2025 were $110,445, made up of professional fees of $40,569, advertising & marketing expenses of $5,000, maintenance expense of
$3,000, website technical support services of $4,900, bank service charges of $48, and amortization expense of $56,928.
Total expenses for the year ended April
30, 2024 were $38,635, made up of professional fees of $22,564, amortization of $15,454, and general and administrative expense of $617.
The increases in revenue and expenses in
the current year were mostly due to the general overall growth of the Company. Specifically, we increased our customer base through advertising
and marketing, paid fees to become eligible with the Depositor Trust Company (DTC), and had our intangible assets amortized for a full
year, versus a partial year in the prior period.
For the year ended April 30, 2025 and
2024, the Company recorded a net loss of $55,071 and $27,835, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
13
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience,
on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and
circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
We consider the following to be critical
accounting policies:
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events
and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes
in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value
of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair
value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures
The Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An assessment was conducted
with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, using the criteria established in “Internal
Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO -
2013").
A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, the Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
15
1.We lack an adequate internal control structure – Due to the size of the Company we do not have the
appropriate control activities, risk assessment procedures, controls over information and communication, or effective monitoring controls.
2.We do not have appropriate segregation of duties or adequate accounting resources – The
Company has only one employee therefore no reviews are in place to ensure adequate financial reporting. Additionally, we lack
accounting personnel with sufficient accounting knowledge, experience, and understanding of U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“US GAAP”) or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Further, while
not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a
financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statements.
Currently the
Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of
management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
3.We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at April 30, 2025, the Company
retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the
Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Further, there
are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or misstatement in, financial reporting.
Accordingly, the Company
concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.
As a result of the material
weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of April 30, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting
There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended April 30, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

any shares such person has the right to acquire within 60 days.
(**) Percent of class is calculated on
the basis of the number of fully diluted shares outstanding on July 21, 2025 - 5,109,878.
ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
It is our practice and policy to
comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding related person transactions, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. A related person is an executive officer, director or more than 5% stockholder of IMA Tech, including any immediate
family members, and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Our Board of Directors (excluding any interested director) is
charged with reviewing and approving all related-person transactions, and a special committee of our Board of Directors is
established to negotiate the terms of such transactions. In considering related-person transactions, our Board of
Directors considers all relevant available facts and circumstances.
19
Director Independence
Our board of directors is currently composed
of one member Ms. Liliia Havrykh, and she does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements
of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list on the NASDAQ Global Market). The NASDAQ independence definition includes
a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that
neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us.
In addition, our board of directors has
not made a subjective determination as to Liliia Havrykh that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors,
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination
is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and
discussed information provided by directors and us regarding our director's business and personal activities and relationships as they
may relate to us and our management.
Related Party Transactions
As of April 30, 2025, the CEO and sole
director of the Company had advanced $252,798 to the Company, of which $58,793 was advanced and $928 was repaid during the year ended
April 30, 2025. This loan is for working capital purposes and is unsecured, interest-free, and has no fixed payment terms other than the
maturity date of March 29, 2028.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders of
IMA Tech
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of IMA Tech as of April
30, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each
of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2025 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IMA Tech as of April 30,
2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2025, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has recurring net losses from
operations and is reporting an accumulated deficit. Additionally, the entity anticipates further losses in the development of their business.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to
these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent
with respect to IMA Tech in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. IMA Tech is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

IMA Tech
Notes to the Financial
Statements
As of April 30, 2025
NOTE
1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
IMA Tech (“the Company”) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Wyoming, U.S. on March 29, 2023 (Inception). IMA Tech is to provide customers with a more immersive experience
by simplifying the process of fulfilling their requests using AI-driven avatars.
NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN
The financial statements were prepared
on a going concern basis that the Company will be able to settle its obligations and make use of its assets in the ordinary course of
business in the near future. IMA Tech has generated $55,374 revenue
and incurred a net loss of $55,071 for as the year
ended April 30, 2025, and is reporting an accumulated deficit since inception of $82,937
as of April 30, 2025. Additionally, further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. As a result, there is substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company's capacity to continue as
a going concern is reliant on its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or secure the required funding to meet
its obligations and settle liabilities resulting from standard business operations when they become due. Management plans to finance
operational expenses for the next twelve months by using available cash on hand, as well as loans from directors and/or a private offering
of Common Stock.
NOTE
3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US
dollars. The Company has adopted an April 30 fiscal year-end.
Use
of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-7
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent that the funds are not being held
for investment purposes. Our cash balance was $4,500 and $7,732
as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and we had no cash equivalents.
Advertising
Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
During the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company incurred advertising costs of $5,000
and $0, respectively.
Intangible
Assets
The Company recognizes and discloses certain
intangible assets in its financial statements, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 350-40,
Internal-Use Software-Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and ASC Subtopic 360-10. ASC 350-40-15-2A describes internal-use
software as having both of the following characteristics:
a. The software
is acquired, internally developed, or modified solely to meet the entity’s internal needs.
b. During
the software’s development or modification, no substantive plan exists or is being developed to market the software externally.
ASC Subtopic 350-40 requires assets to
be recorded at the cost to develop the asset and requires an intangible asset to be amortized over its useful life. Costs incurred to
renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
As of April 30, 2025 and 2024 we recorded
intangible assets, totaling $212,257 and $269,184, respectively that include the following:

These costs are being amortized over a
period of 5 years, resulting in an expected annual amortization expense of $56,928 through April 30, 2028 and $41,472 for the year ended
April 30, 2029. For the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded amortization expenses of $56,928 and $15,454, respectively.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
These tiers include:
Level 1: defined as observable inputs
such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: defined as inputs other than
quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3:  defined as unobservable
inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The carrying value of our assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events
and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes
in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value
of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair
value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Income
Taxes
The Company follows the liability method
of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary
differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.
F-9
Revenue
Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with ASC 606. ASC 606 directs entities to recognize revenue when the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer. The
amount of revenue recognized should equal the total consideration an entity expects to receive in return for the goods or services. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board created a five-step approach that entities should apply when determining the amount and timing of
revenue recognition:
Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The Company provides API keys that give access
to the number of minutes for the video creation process using our software. The Company's policy generally requires payment upon issuance
of an invoice. Once payment is received, the Company provides the key to the service and specifies the period of time (generally 1 month)
for which these minutes must be used. On occasion, the Company may provide the key prior to payment with an agreed upon payment date
in the executed contract. The customer may not transfer the key-access to third parties. Revenue is recognized by the Company ratably
over the specified period of time that the customer is granted access to our software.
During the years ended April 30, 2025
and 2024 the Company recorded $55,374 and $10,800
of revenue, respectively. As of April 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 the Company reported deferred revenue of $4,400, $4,700, and $0 respectively.
Accounts receivable was $0 as of April 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023.
Net
Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes income (loss) per
share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
on the face of the statement of operations. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to Common
Stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive income (loss) per share excludes all potential common
shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted income (loss)
per share are equal.
F-10
Foreign
Currency
The Company’s functional and reporting
currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions may occur in foreign currencies and management follows ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the
date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation
or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the Statement of Operations.
Dividends
The Company has not adopted any policy
regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the period presented.
Segment
Reporting
The Company operates as a single operating
and reportable segment, developing and deploying digital avatars. Our Chief Executive Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker,
(“CODM”) who evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources considering our single geographical
area and on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, the CODM considers the revenue and operating expenses of our single operating segment
as reported on the statement of operations and considers our current and total assets as recorded on the balance sheet. There are no
additional expense or asset information that are supplemental to those disclosed in these financial statements that are regularly provided
to the CODM.
