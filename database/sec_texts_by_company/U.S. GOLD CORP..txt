FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
Some
information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) may contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking
statements concern our anticipated results and developments in our operations in future periods, planned exploration and development
of our properties, plans related to our business and other matters that may occur in the future. These statements relate to analyses
and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
These statements include, but are not limited to, comments regarding:
●
The timing,
process, and outcome of permitting, construction, and development activities at the CK Gold Project;
●
The assumptions and projections
contained in our updated CK Gold Project prefeasibility study, including estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves, mine life,
projected operating and capital costs, projected production, internal rate of return (“IRR”) and Net Present Value (“NPV”)
calculations, and the possibility of upside potential at the project;
●
The planned extensions
of our leases;
●
Our planned expenditures
during our fiscal year ended April 30, 2026;
●
Future exploration plans
and expectations related to our properties;
●
Our ability to fund our
business through April 30, 2026 with our current cash reserves based on our currently planned activities;
●
Our anticipation of future
environmental and regulatory impacts; and
●
Our business and operating
strategies.
We
use the words “anticipate,” “continue,” “likely,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,”
“could,” “will,” “project,” “should,” “believe” and similar expressions (including
negative and grammatical variations) to identify forward-looking statements. Statements that contain these words discuss our future expectations
and plans, or state other forward-looking information. Although we believe the expectations and assumptions reflected in those forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. Our actual results
could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors described
in this Form 10-K, including:
●
Unfavorable results from
our exploration activities;
●
Decreases in gold, copper
or silver prices;
●
Whether we are able to
raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to us or at all, and the likely negative effect
of volatility in metals prices or unfavorable exploration results;
●
Whether we will be able
to begin to mine and sell minerals successfully or profitably at any of our current properties at current or future metals prices;
●
Potential delays in our
exploration activities or other activities to advance properties towards mining resulting from environmental consents or permitting
delays or problems, accidents, problems with contractors, disputes under agreements related to exploration properties, unanticipated
costs and other unexpected events;
●
Our ability to retain key
management and mining personnel necessary to successfully operate and grow our business;
●
Economic
and political events affecting the market prices for gold, copper, silver, and other minerals that may be found on our exploration
properties;
●
Volatility in the market
price of our common stock; and
●
The factors set forth under
“Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Many
of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us. Consequently,
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from
the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of
this Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements
to reflect future events or developments. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us and persons acting
on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

PART
I
Items
1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
Overview
U.S.
Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”),
was re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016 and was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967.
Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company
merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the
business of Gold King became the business of the Company. We are a gold, copper and precious metals development and exploration company
pursuing exploration opportunities primarily in Wyoming, Nevada and Idaho.
While
we are an exploration and development company that owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project
in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho, most of our recent activity has focused on moving the
CK Gold Project along the development pathway. The Company’s CK Gold Project’s property contains proven and probable mineral
reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property, as defined in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (“S-K 1300”)
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). None of the Company’s other properties contain proven
and probable mineral reserves and all activities are exploratory in nature. We do not currently have any revenue-producing activities.

Quality
Assurance/Quality Control (“QA/QC”) Protocol
We
employ a rigorous QA/QC protocol on all aspects of sampling and analytical procedure. Drill core is checked, logged, marked for sampling
and sawn in half. One-half of each drill core is maintained for future reference and the other half of each drill core is sent to ALS,
an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory in Elko, Nevada to complete all sample preparation and assaying. Samples are analyzed by employing
fire assaying with atomic absorption finish for gold, and four-acid ICP-MS analysis for silver and copper. For QA/QC protocol purposes,
certified standards, blank samples and sample duplicates are inserted into the sample stream. We also periodically submit sample pulps
to another independent laboratory for check analysis. With respect to the CK Gold Project, and as part of the examination and preparation
of a Technical Report under Reg. S-K 1300 guidelines, QA/QC protocols have been independently checked. We retain core remnants, duplicates,
pulps and rejects in one of several secured facilities.
CK
Gold Project, Wyoming
The
CK Gold Project consists of certain mining leases and other mineral rights located in the historic Silver Crown Mining District of southeast
Wyoming.
Location
and Access
The
CK Gold Project is located in southeastern Wyoming, approximately 20 miles west of the city of Cheyenne, on the southeastern margin of
the Laramie Range (Figure 1). The property covers about two square miles that include the S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35,
and all of Section 36, T.14N., R.70W., Sixth Principal Meridian. Access to within an approximate 4.0 miles of the property is provided
by public paved and maintained gravel roads. An agreement with the private landowner (The Ferguson Ranch Inc. (“Ferguson Ranch”))
provides access for the remaining distance to the main project area. The surface of S½ Section 25, NE¼ Section 35 is privately
owned by the Ferguson Ranch. An easement agreement providing access for exploration and potential development activities has been negotiated
with an adjacent landowner. The fee for this easement is $10,000 per year, renewable each year prior to September 1. The surface of Section
36 is owned by the State of Wyoming and is currently leased to an adjacent landowner for grazing. Currently, the surface of Section 36
is leased for grazing by the Ferguson Ranch and part of the option to lease the lands necessary for project development and operation
is compensation to the Ferguson Ranch for loss of grazing, as and when areas are impacted.
The
project is entirely located on mineral rights owned and administered by the State of Wyoming. There are no federal lands within or adjoining
the CK Gold Project’s land position. Curt Gowdy State Park lies northwest of the property, partially within Section 26. The state
park’s southeastern boundary is approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the property and approximately 3,000 feet northwest of the
mineralized area. The CK Gold Project’s property position consists of two State of Wyoming Metallic and Non- metallic Rocks and
Minerals Mining Leases.
Through
Gold King, the project has acquired two 35-acre parcels immediately adjacent to Section 36 in Section 35, on the western boundary of
the project area. This 70-acre landholding provides a buffer to other occupied and unoccupied parcels to the west of the project area.

Section
25: S/2
Section
35: NE/4
Ownership
of the mineral rights remains in the possession of the State of Wyoming as conveyed to the State by the United States, evidenced by 1942
patents for Section 36, and 1989 Order confirming title to Section 25 and 35. The State of Wyoming issued Mineral Leases for the mineral
rights to Wyoming Gold Mining Company, Inc. (“Wyoming Gold”) in 2013 and 2014. These leases were assigned to us on June 23,
2014.
Lease
0-40828 is a ten-year lease that was renewed in 2023 and expires on February 1, 2033. Annual rental payments under this lease are $3.00
per acre. Lease 0-40858 is a ten-year lease that was renewed in 2024 and expires on February 1, 2034. Annual rental payments under this
lease are $3.00 per acre. Each lease is renewable for successive ten-year terms by submitting a renewal application fee and paying a
nominal fee of $50. We anticipate continuing to renew each lease beyond their current expiration dates.
Effective
April 6, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Office of State Lands and Investments (“OSLI”) approved the recommendation from
the staff of the OSLI fixing the production royalty rate at a flat 2.1% of net receipts received by us once the project is in operation.
Additionally, once the project is in operation, the Board of Directors of the OSLI has the authority to reduce the royalty payable to
the State. Additionally, original lease restrictions limiting operations on the lease areas, deemed critical mule deer habitat, were
lifted by OSLI after the company came to an arrangement with The Wyoming Department of Game and Fish (“Game and Fish”) to
make a compensatory payment to Game and Fish to support habitat and conservation measures. The agreed amount to be paid by the Company
to Game and Fish once development and operational impact occur amounts to $300,000.
Infrastructure
Given
the project’s proximity to Cheyenne, the state capital of Wyoming and the Front Range metropolitan area, personnel needs, delivery
of consumables, and infrastructure needs are available both locally and regionally. The area has access to both BNSF and Union Pacific
railroad lines, intersection of 2 major interstate highways, I-80 and I-25, and a regional airport.
High
voltage powerlines are approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the current project area. A connection to the local power provider and easement
for transmission lines has been identified and scoped. While there is a nearby line serving the local population, we anticipate that
a new line to the project site, catering to approximately a 30-Megawatt load will be constructed and talks have been conducted with the
local power provider (Black Hills Energy), the designated provider for the area. Indicative rates including the installation of approximately
16-miles of line from a nearby sub-station have been received and incorporated into project engineering studies.
In
February 2023, we entered into a Water Development and Purchase Agreement (“Water Agreement”) with the Board of Public Utilities
(the “BOPU”) of the City of Cheyenne. Under this Water Agreement, BOPU will provide a firm supply of up to 600 gallons per
minute for the life of the project. It is anticipated that the water to be supplied under this Water Agreement will come from the Lone
Tree well field owned by BOPU. A pipeline from the Lone Tree well field to the project will be required to be constructed. Minor water
sources have been identified around the project site from monitoring well locations, and additional deeper well sites will be investigated
in upcoming fields seasons with a view to securing an independent water supply.

Permitting
Mine
Operating Permit and Closure Plan (“MOP”)
In
September 2022, we filed our mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”) with the WDEQ – Land Division (the “WDEQ”).
In November 2022, we received notification from WDEQ that our MOP was deemed complete and that it was under technical review. In April
2023, we received a first round of technical comments and worked with the WDEQ to fully respond to their initial review. In May 2024,
WDEQ issued us a letter of approval for the MOP.
Per
WDEQ’s letter of approval, there were three conditions to the MOP: (1) acceptance of a reclamation bond in the amount of $5,010,000;
(2) receipt of a water discharge permit from WDEQ; and (3) receipt of the WDEQ Air Quality Division permit. The Company has now satisfied
all three conditions. Specifically, the reclamation bond was accepted, the water discharge permit was obtained, and the WDEQ Air Quality
Permit was received in November 2024.
Industrial
Siting Permit (“ISP”)
In
February 2023, we submitted our ISP with the Industrial Siting Division of the WDEQ. An ISP is required for all projects within the state
of Wyoming when the projected capital costs are anticipated to exceed $253.9 million. This threshold includes costs we may incur as well
as costs incurred from other parties. The ISP’s intent is to ascertain the regional impacts during construction and mine operation
and release state funds to local governments to offset anticipated impacts. Subsequent to the permit submission, a hearing was held with
the Industrial Siting Commission in May 2023 whereby our ISP was approved. In June 2023, we received official notification from the state
of Wyoming that our ISP was granted.
History
of Prior Operations and Exploration on the CK Gold Project
Limited
exploration and mining were conducted on the CK Gold Project’s property in the late 1880s and early 1900s. Approximately 300 tons
of material was reported to have been produced from a now inaccessible 160-foot-deep shaft with two levels of cross-cuts. A few small
adits and prospect pits with no significant production are scattered throughout the property.
Since
1938, at least nine historic (pre-Strathmore Minerals Corp.) drilling campaigns by at least seven companies plus the U.S. Bureau of Mines
have been conducted at CK Gold Project’s property, previously referred to as Copper King. The current project database contains
91 drill holes totaling 37,500 feet that were drilled before Wyoming Gold acquired the property. All but six of the drill holes are within
the current resource area. Other work conducted at the CK Gold Project’s property by previous companies has included ground and
aeromagnetic surveys as well as induced polarization surveys along with geochemical sampling, geologic mapping, and a number of metallurgical
studies.
Wyoming
Gold conducted an exploration drill program in 2007 and 2008. Thirty-five diamond core drill holes were completed for a total of 25,500
feet. The focus of that work was to confirm and potentially expand the mineralized body outlined in the previous drill campaigns, increase
the geologic and geochemical database leading to the creation of the current geologic model and mineralization estimate, and to provide
material for further metallurgical testing. The CK Gold Project’s historic assay database for some 120 holes contains 8,357 gold
assays and 8,225 copper assays. At least 10 different organizations or individuals conducted metallurgical studies on the gold-copper
mineralization at the request of prior operators between 1973 and 2009.
Gustavson
Associates LLC (now WSP USA, Inc.) completed a prefeasibility study in December 2021. The study incorporated data from the Company’s
reverse circulation drilling programs, which included two holes drilled in 2017 and eight holes in 2018, totaling 12,040 feet. Both drilling
programs were designed to investigate magnetic and induced polarization anomalies identified through geophysical surveys. In addition,
the Company conducted a 2020 drilling program comprising 25 drill holes totaling 20,449 feet. The prefeasibility study confirmed favorable
project economics, established the first mineral reserve, and recommended advancing the project to a full feasibility study.
11
Geology
and Mineralization
The
CK Gold Project is underlain by Proterozoic rocks that make up the southern end of the Precambrian core of the Laramie Range. Metavolcanic
and metasedimentary rocks of amphibolite-grade metamorphism are intruded by the 1.4-billion-year-old Sherman Granite and related felsic
rocks. Within the project area, foliated granodiorite is intruded by aplitic quartz monzonite dikes, thin mafic dikes and younger pegmatite
dikes. Shear zones with cataclastic foliation striking N60°E to N60°W are found in the southern part of the Silver Crown district,
including at CK Gold. The granodiorite typically shows potassium enrichment, particularly near contacts with quartz monzonite. Copper
and gold mineralization occur primarily in unfoliated to mylonitic granodiorite. The mineralization is associated with a N60°W-trending
shear zone and disseminated and stockwork gold-copper deposits in the intrusive rocks. The mineralization style is consistent with a
porphyry gold-copper deposit of Paleoproterozoic age. Hydrothermal alteration is overprinted on retrograde greenschist alteration and
includes a central zone of silicification, followed outward by a narrow potassic zone, surrounded by propylitic alteration. Higher-grade
mineralization occurs within a central core of thin quartz veining and stockwork mineralization that is surrounded by a ring of lower-grade
disseminated mineralization. Disseminated sulfides and native copper with stockwork malachite and chrysocolla are present at the surface,
and chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor bornite, primary chalcocite, pyrrhotite, and native copper are present at depth. Gold occurs as free
gold and within chalcopyrite crystals.
The
CK Gold Project’s property contains oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide, and sulfide rock types. There is consistent distribution of gold
and copper, albeit generally low-grade, throughout this potential open-pit type deposit.

Updated
Prefeasibility Study (“PFS”)
On
February 11, 2025, we released the results of our updated prefeasibility study (“PFS”). The PFS was prepared by the Company
and Samuel Engineering Inc., with an effective date of February 10, 2025. The PFS outlines the basis to proceed to a feasibility study
(“FS”).
The
following are highlights from the PFS:
●
AuEq production
of 1,112,000 AuEq ounces over the mine life, or 111,250 AuEq ounces per year, assuming a 10-year mine life. The first three years
average 143,278 AuEq ounces annually. Over the life of the mine, the PFS estimates total production of approximately 679,548 ounces
of gold, 208.3 million pounds of copper, and 2.04 million ounces of silver. Additionally, over the life of the mine, the PFS estimates total sales of approximately 662,560 ounces of gold, 195.4 million pounds of
copper, and 1.07 million ounces of silver.
●
Base case Net Present
Value (“NPV”) of $459 million (pre-tax), at a discount rate of 5%, and Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”)
of 36.0%, each based on price assumptions of $2,100 per ounce of gold, $4.10 per pound of copper and $27 per ounce of silver.
The project payback improved by 15%, and the NPV improved by 42% over the prior prefeasibility study. Reflecting potential higher
price assumptions of $3,000 per ounce gold and $4.50 per pound copper, the NPV increases to $952 million (pre-tax)
with a 60.8% IRR.
●
All-in sustaining cost
of $937 per AuEq ounce (life of mine average).
●
Initial capital requirements
of $277 million, which includes approximately $3.6 million of capital retention payments post-construction.
●
Mineral Reserves of
1.672 million AuEq ounces, supporting an eight-year mine life and 10 years of processing. This includes 1.022 million ounces
of gold, 259.7 million pounds of copper, and 3.008 million ounces of silver—a 16% increase over the AuEq ounces reflected in
the prior prefeasibility study.
●
Aggregate potential,
not included in the study economics presented, could provide significant upside potential for an additional revenue stream
should the beneficial use of aggregate produced from mine waste be recognized and commercialized.
●
Advancing toward FS
completion by the end of 2025, with key groundwork already completed to facilitate fast-tracking. No extensive additional fieldwork
or major expenses are required for FS completion.
●
Exploration potential
exists to expand resources at depth and to the southeast of the main orebody, potentially extending mine life or increasing production.
The
economic projections in the PFS are subject to a variety of assumptions and qualifications that are described in more detail in the Technical
Report Summary incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. In summary, the low-grade copper, silver and gold deposit located on Wyoming
State Land and under lease to US Gold Corp, is proposed as an open pit mine. The rate of extraction will be sufficient to feed minerals
to the process plant at a rate of 20,000 tons per day, involving the removal of surrounding waste material at a similar rate. The process
plant serves to crush and grind the ore into a fine particle form in a slurry, whereupon the copper, silver and gold values can be separated
from non-mineralized rock into a concentrate using froth flotation. The concentrate will be dried and shipped off site and sold to a
smelter for final metal extraction. The waste material will be filtered to recoup and recycle water back to the process plant, and the
filtered tailings will be trucked and mechanically stacked onto a tailings pile. The process facility is also on the same Wyoming State
section less than a mile away from the mineralized orebody, with the entire operation some 20-miles west of Cheyenne. The metallurgical
test work supporting the extraction methodology was initially performed by a previous owner between 2009 and 2012, but the Company has
gathered additional representative sample and conducted further extensive test work between 2020 and 2023. The results of that work were
incorporated into the PFS. The Company expects to finalize the feasibility study at a later date.

We
expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred. Although we have identified proven and probable mineral reserves on our CK Gold Project,
development costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, (a) we receive the requisite operating permits,
(b) completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and (c) approval from our Board of Directors (our “Board”) authorizing the
development of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have been met, we record pre-development costs to expense as incurred.
The current book value of our property is approximately $3.1 million, which is recorded in mineral properties and reflects the
value that was attributed to the purchase of the CK Gold Project. We do not have any costs on our balance sheet related to plant or equipment
as we have not incurred any such costs.
Recent
Activities
We
submitted both of our major permit applications during the year-ended April 30, 2023, the MOP and Industrial Siting Permit (the “ISP”).
We were granted our ISP in June 2023 providing local governments the ability to receive state funds to mitigate impacts from the anticipated
construction and operation of our CK Gold Project. In May 2024, we received approval of the MOP subject to three conditions (reclamation
bond approval, water discharge permit and air quality permit). All three of these conditions have been satisfied.
Primarily
in support of the feasibility study presently underway, during the 2021 field season, 47 core, reverse circulation rotary and conventional
rotary holes were drilled at the CK Gold Project. The primary purpose of the drilling program is to supplement the geotechnical and hydrological
information.
Additional
work centered around the capture and interpretation of environmental base line data encompassing sub-surface and surface water, fauna,
flora, cultural, air quality, meteorological conditions, wetlands and socio-economic factors in the project area. Since September 2020,
over 3 1/2 years of monitoring data have been gathered and ongoing monitoring in critical areas continues.
Additionally,
a great deal of social outreach has been conducted to familiarize the immediate population and the Wyoming, Cheyenne and Laramie governmental
and regulatory agencies.
Geological
Potential of the CK Gold Project
Potential
to expand the existing resource exists primarily at depth beyond current drilling depths and to the south of the proposed pit. Numerous
drill holes end in significant mineralization. A geophysical anomaly to the southeast supports the trend extending from the proposed
open pit as identified by step-out drilling from the current reserve boundary; however, to date exploration has not pinpointed mineralization
that might be associated with the anomaly further to the southeast in what is thought to be fairly complex geologic conditions.
Keystone
Project, Cortez Trend, Nevada
Location
The
Keystone Project consists of 601 unpatented lode mining claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. The claims making up the Keystone Project
are situated in Eureka County, Nevada in Sections 2-4 and 9-11, Township 23 North, Range 48 East, and Sections 22- 28, and 33-36 Township
24 North, all Range 48 East of the Mount Diablo Meridian (Figures 2 and 3).

tracks.
Title
and Ownership for Keystone Project
The
Keystone Project consists of unpatented mining claims located on federal land administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”).
An annual maintenance fee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to the Nevada BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make
the payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to the annual maintenance fee paid to the Nevada BLM, a $12 per claim fee is
due to the Eureka County (NV) Clerk’s office as a record fee.
17
We
acquired the mining claims comprising the Keystone Project on May 27, 2016 from Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC and Americas Gold Exploration,
Inc. (“Americas Gold”). Some of the Keystone claims are subject to pre-existing net smelter royalty (“NSR”) obligations.
In addition, Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC, retained additional NSR rights of 0.5% with regard to certain claims and 3.5% with regard to
certain other claims. The unpatented mining claims comprising the Keystone Project, with applicable NSR obligations, are as follows:
1.

Under
the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated May 25, 2016, under which we acquired the claims, we had the right to buy down 1%
of the NSR owed to Nevada Gold Ventures LLC at any time through the fifth anniversary of the closing date, May 25, 2021, for $2,000,000.
In addition, we may buy down an additional 1% of the NSR owed to Nevada Gold Ventures, LLC anytime through the eighth anniversary of
the closing date, May 25, 2024, for $5,000,000. We did not buy down any portion of the NSR.
History
of Prior Operations and Exploration on the Keystone Project
No
comprehensive, modern-era, model-driven exploration has ever been conducted on the Keystone Project. Newmont drilled 6 holes in the old
base metal and silver Keystone mine area in 1967 and encountered low-grade (+/- 0.02 opt) gold intercepts. Chevron staked the property
in 1981-1983 and drilled 27 shallow drill holes, continued by an agreement with USMX that drilled an additional 19 shallow holes; significant
amounts of low grade and anomalous gold were intersected, but results were considered uneconomic, and the project was dropped. In 1988
and 1989, Phelps Dodge acquired a southern portion of the district and drilled 6 holes, one of which contained gold mineralization in
its total depth and was subsequently deepened in 1990 resulting in over 200’ of low-grade gold mineralization. About this time
Coral Resources acquired a northern portion of the property and drilled 21 shallow holes to follow-up previous drill intercepts. 1995-1997,
Golden Glacier, a junior company, acquired the north end of the district, and Uranerz a portion of the southern area; 6 holes were drilled
in the north and only 2 holes in the south, respectively. The entire district was dropped by all parties.
18
In
2004, with the discovery of Cortez Hills and escalating gold prices, Nevada Pacific Gold, Great American Minerals (Don McDowell), and
Tone Resources (Dave Mathewson) competed in claim staking the entire district. Subsequently, Don McDowell, founder of Great American
Minerals approached Placer Dome (prior to Barrick acquisition) who discovered Pipeline and Cortez Hills, and who correctly recognized
the Keystone district potential. Placer Dome entered into separate joint venture agreements with Nevada Pacific and Great American. The
following year Barrick Gold bought Placer Dome and dropped all Placer Dome’s Nevada exploration projects and joint ventures, including
Keystone. In 2006, Nevada Pacific and Tone were purchased by McEwen Mining. McEwen Mining drilled 35 holes mostly near the north end
of the district; targeting the range front pediment and the historic Keystone Mine. McEwen Mining dropped their Keystone claims and quit
claimed them to Dave Mathewson and NV Gold Ventures. NV Gold Ventures and American Gold staked their own additional claims in the district.
This expanded group of claims was acquired in the original Keystone Purchase Agreement. We have staked additional claims in the district,
such as Potato Canyon, since acquiring the project.
Geology
and Mineralization
To
date, a technical report has not been prepared on the Keystone Project. Keystone is positioned on the prolific Cortez gold trend. The
Keystone Project is centered on a granitic intrusion that warped the local Paleozoic stratigraphy into a dome, allowing for exposure
of highly favorable Devonian, Carboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvania) and Permo- Triassic rocks including key likely host rocks for
mineralization, the silty carbonate strata of the Horse Creek Formation and the Wenban limestone, as well as possible sandy clastic units
of the Diamond Peak Formation. The Horse Canyon and Wenban rocks are the primary host rocks at the nearby Cortez Hills Mine and Gold
Rush deposit currently operated by Barrick Gold.
In
2022, a hyperspectral survey was conducted on the property identifying evidence of potential mineralization. Numerous anomalies often
associated with mineralization were identified. Field investigation of the anomalies commenced during the 2023 field season. In September
2023, we announced completion of a hyperspectral study, which yielded the discovery of multiple high priority targets requiring further
investigation and adding to the targets identified from the Company’s prior work at the project.
Infrastructure
and Facilities
The
Keystone Project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Keystone Project sits some 10 miles to the southwest of Nevada
Gold mines Cortez Complex. The Cortez Complex, consisting of surface and underground mines, is served by roads and power, while water
in the area is extracted from sub-surface water resources. The Keystone Project is served by paved and unpaved roads, which extend down
trend from the Cortez Complex to the north and additional road and infrastructure to the north-east. The whole area is some 30 miles
to the south of the I-80 interstate corridor between the towns of Battle Mountain and Winnemucca, with Elko, Nevada being the dormitory
town for the majority of the workforce and support services.
The
Challis Gold Project, Idaho
Location
The
Challis Gold property is situated in the Salmon River Mountains, approximately 40 km (25 mi) southwest of the town of Salmon, Idaho,
and 69 km (43 mi) north of the smaller town of Challis (Figure 4). The project area is considered to be within the Cobalt Mining District,
as the past-producing Blackbird Cobalt Mine is located 9.3 km (5.75 mi) north-northwest of the property. The nearly-abandoned town of
Cobalt, a previous company town for the Blackbird Mine, is along Panther Creek 9.7 km (6 mi) northeast of the property. Meridian Gold’s
Beartrack Mine, the closest of the larger gold mines in the region, is 24 km (15 mi) northeast of the Challis Gold Project. The central
portion of the property is located at approximately 45º 2’ North Latitude and 114º 20’ West Longitude. The claims
are situated in the south-central portion of unsurveyed Township T20N, R18E.

Title
and Ownership for Challis Gold Project
All
of the mining claims comprising the Musgrove property are unpatented lode mining claims that have been recorded in the Lemhi County Court
House in Salmon, Idaho and filed with the US BLM office in Boise. An annual maintenance fee of $200 per claim per year must be paid to
the BLM by September 1 of each year, and failure to make the payment on time renders the claims void. In addition to the annual maintenance
fee, $20 is due to the Lemhi County (ID) Recorder’s office as a notice of intent to hold fee.
History
of Prior Operations and Exploration
Early
mining dates to the late 1880’s when gold was discovered at the nearby Yellow Jacket Mine and copper and cobalt was discovered
north of the project area at the Blackbird Mine. Small scale intermittent mining was conducted in the project area from 1908 through
the 1930’s at the Musgrove Mine and at the Smith-Gahan Mine.
In
the mid-1980’s, alteration and quartz veining was identified located along the ridge north of Musgrove Creek A large block of claims
covering the area was staked by an independent geologist and then leased to Atlas Minerals. Atlas completed an extensive sampling program
and, in 1991, drilled nine reverse circulation holes resulting in the discovery of significant mineralization at the Johny’s Point
deposit.
The
project was acquired by Newmont in 1992 as part of the Grassy Mountain Deposit acquisition. Newmont conducted an extensive exploration
program between 1992 and the fall of 1995 consisting of mapping and rock chip sampling. Twenty-seven core holes were completed consisting
of nine holes in the Johny’s Point area and 18 holes testing targets along strike from Johny’s Point. Newmont concluded that
the project did not meet the potential for their size criteria and the project was dropped.
In
1996, Meridian Gold acquired the property and drilled an additional 20 core holes and three reverse circulation drill holes. The property
was subsequently returned to the owner due to declining gold prices.
In
2003, Wave Exploration leased the property and completed a GIS compilation of the surface and drill hole data. Wave subsequently commissioned
a technical report. In 2004, Wave drilled two confirmation drill holes and two step out holes and completed a soil geochemical program
northwest of Johny’s Point.
In
2005, Wave optioned the property to Journey Resources. In 2006 and 2007, Journey drilled nine reverse circulation drill holes and five
core holes northwest of Johny’s Point.
There
is no documented exploration activity from 2008 until 2018. On September 1, 2018, Journey Resources failed to pay the required claim
payments to the Bureau of Land Management and the claims were forfeited. Subsequently, Northern Panther Resources Corporation located
or acquired new claims covering the project. In 2020, we acquired Northern Panther Resources. In 2020, we contracted with Wright Geophysics
to conduct a ground magnetic geophysical over the current claim block. This survey identified a prominent low magnetic linear feature
that trends from the Musgrove Mine north-northwest for over two miles.
Geology
and Mineralization
The
project is located within the Trans-Challis Fault System, a prominent NE-trending fault zone which crosscuts central Idaho and hosts
numerous gold deposits. Host rocks consist of quartzites and phyllites of the Precambrian Apple Creek Fm with minor mineralization within
the Eocene Challis Volcanics. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point mineral trend is within and adjacent to the Musgrove Fault,
a northwest-trending fault that brings the Challis Volcanics into contact with the Precambrian rocks. This is a major structural zone
that forms the northern edge of the Panther Creek Graben.
Gold
mineralization occurs within epithermal quartz veins, quartz vein stockworks, and silicified breccia. The mineralization displays the
characteristics of a low sulfidation epithermal gold system. The Musgrove Mine – Johny’s Point mineral trend has been defined
by a broad soil and rock chip gold and arsenic anomaly that extends a distance of 3,000 feet and is up to 800 feet wide. Approximately
600 feet of this zone has been drilled with the remainder tested by wide spaced drilling.
21
Infrastructure
and Facilities
The
Challis Gold project does not currently include any significant facilities. The Challis property is located in the Salmon-Challis National
Forest and is reached by paved and unpaved roads. There are historic workings in the area and there has been recent mining activity in
the area. The site is somewhat remote from grid power and power lines would have to be extended into the area, or onsite power generation
used to support an eventual operation. There is water in the area from both surface and sub-surface sources. The Bear Track operation,
now closed but under renewed exploration, is some 16 miles as the crow flies to the northeast of the property. Historic mining was conducted;
however, the facilities have been abandoned decades ago and the nearest habited area is a forest ranger station near Forney some 5-miles
from site.
Competition
We
do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to
the claims. Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will
likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies
in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and certain equipment such
as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful
in securing the products, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.
Compliance
with Government Regulation
We
will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration
of minerals in the United States generally. We will also be subject to the regulations of the BLM and the US Forest Service (“Forest
Service”) with respect to mining claims on federal lands.
Future
exploration drilling on any of our properties that consist of BLM or Forest Service land will require us to either file a Notice of Intent
(NOI) or a Plan of Operations, depending upon the amount of new surface disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is required for
planned surface activities that anticipate less than 5.0 acres of surface disturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60-day
time period.
Environmental
Permitting Requirements
Various
levels of governmental controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mineral mining and exploration
operations and establish requirements for reclamation of mineral mining and exploration properties after exploration operations have
ceased. With respect to the regulation of mineral mining and exploration, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish
performance standards, air and water quality emission limits and other design or operational requirements for various aspects of the
operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for reclamation and rehabilitation
of mining properties following the cessation of operations and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods
of time after mining activities have ceased.
Our
activities are subject to various levels of federal and state laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including
requirements for closure and reclamation of mineral exploration properties. Some of the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act,
the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws in Nevada. Additionally, much of our property is subject to the
federal General Mining Law of 1872, which regulates how mining claims on federal lands are located and maintained.
22
The
State of Nevada, where we focus mineral exploration efforts, requires mining projects to obtain a Nevada State Reclamation Permit pursuant
to the Mined Land Reclamation Act (the “Nevada MLR Act”), which establishes reclamation and financial assurance requirements
for all mining operations in the state. New and expanding facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance
to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon completion of operations. The Nevada MLR Act also requires reclamation plans
and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance on private lands.
The
State of Wyoming, where we focus mineral exploration and development efforts at the CK Gold Project, requires exploration and mining
projects to obtain permits from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), and various other state agencies. New and expanding
facilities are required to provide a reclamation plan and financial assurance to ensure that the reclamation plan is implemented upon
completion of operations. WDEQ, in granting permits, requires that reclamation plans and permits are in place and that bonds have been
secured covering the cost of remediation of disturbances on both state and private land.

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
If
we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately
or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely
impact the trading price of our common stock and our ability to file registration statements pursuant to registration rights agreements
and other commitments.
Effective
internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed,
and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result of our small size, any current internal control deficiencies
may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. As of April 30, 2025, management has concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective.
There
is substantial doubt about whether we can continue as a going concern.
To
date, we have earned no revenues and have incurred accumulated net losses of $93.4 million. We have limited financial resources. As of
April 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.2 million and working capital of $8.0 million. Therefore, our continuation as
a going concern is dependent upon our achieving a future financing or strategic transaction. However, there is no assurance that we will
be successful pursuing a financing or strategic transaction. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt as to whether our existing cash
resources and working capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern. Ultimately,
in the event that we cannot obtain additional financial resources, or achieve profitable operations, we may have to liquidate our business
interests and investors may lose their investment. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that
our company will continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on our ability to obtain additional financial resources
or generate profitable operations. Such additional financial resources may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms.
Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Such adjustments
could be material.
We
have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.
Since
our inception, we have had no revenue from operations. We have no history of producing metals from any of our exploration properties.
Our properties are exploration stage properties. Advancing properties from the exploration stage requires significant capital and time,
and successful commercial production from a property, if any, will be subject to completing feasibility studies, permitting and construction
of the potential mine, processing plants, roads, and other related works and infrastructure. As a result, we are subject to all of the
risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including:
●
completion
of feasibility studies to verify potential mineral reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient mineral
reserves to support a commercial mining operation;
●
the timing and cost, which
can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining
and processing facilities;
24
●
the availability and costs
of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor and mining and processing equipment, if required;
●
the availability and cost
of appropriate smelting and/or refining arrangements, if required;
●
compliance with environmental
and other governmental approval and permit requirements;
●
the availability of funds
to finance exploration activities, as warranted;
●
potential opposition from
non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent exploration activities;
●
potential increases in
exploration, construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials and supplies;
●
inability to secure fair
and reasonable terms associated with mineral leases; and
●
potential shortages of
mineral processing, construction and other facilities-related supplies.
The
costs, timing and complexities of exploration activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral
exploration and mining companies. It is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs
and, if ever commenced, development, construction and mine start-up. Accordingly, our activities may not ever result in profitable mining
operations, and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at any of our properties.
We
will require significant additional capital to fund our business plan.
We
will be required to expend significant funds to continue exploration and if warranted, develop our existing exploration properties and
to identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our properties portfolio. We have spent and will be required to continue to
expend significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical analysis, assaying and feasibility studies with regard
to the results of our exploration. We may not benefit from some of these investments if we are unable to identify any commercially exploitable
mineralized material.
Our
ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including the status of the national
and worldwide economy and the price of gold and copper. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing or, if we can obtain
such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result
in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration operations, development activities and the possible partial or total loss
of our potential interest in our properties.
Our
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we make to prepare our financial statements, which could have a material
impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements, including the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K,
our management is required under GAAP to make estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. On an on-going
basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If management’s estimates and assumptions change or are not correct, our financial
condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
We
do not know if our properties contain any gold or other minerals that can be mined at a profit.
Although
the properties on which we have the right to explore for gold are known to have historic deposits of gold, there can be no assurance
such deposits can be mined at a profit. Whether a gold deposit can be mined at a profit depends upon many factors. Some but not all of
these factors include: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; operating costs
and capital expenditures required to start mining a deposit; the availability and cost of financing; the price of gold, which is highly
volatile and cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land use, importing and
exporting of minerals and environmental protection.
25
Most
of our projects are in the exploration stage.
Although
we have established an estimate of mineral reserves on the CK Gold Project, there are no current estimates of mineral resources or mineral
reserves at the Keystone Property or Challis Gold Project. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral reserves
on those projects in commercially exploitable quantities. If we do not establish the existence of mineral reserves or mineral resources
on those projects, we may lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration.
The
commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade
and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point
for shipping, government regulation and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase
costs and make extraction of any identified mineral deposit unprofitable.
We
have no history of producing metals from our current mineral properties and there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish
mining operations or profitably produce precious metals.
We
have no history of producing metals from our properties. We do not produce gold and do not currently generate operating earnings. While
we seek to advance our projects and properties through exploration, such efforts will be subject to all of the risks associated with
establishing new future potential mining operations and business enterprises, including:
●
the timing and cost, which
are considerable, of the construction of mining and processing facilities;
●
the availability and costs
of skilled labor and mining equipment;
●
compliance with environmental
and other governmental approval and permit requirements;
●
the availability of funds
to finance exploration activities;
●
potential opposition from
non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants that may delay or prevent exploration activities;
and
●
potential increases in
construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of labor, fuel, power, materials and supplies.
It
is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays. In addition, our management will need to be expanded.
This could result in delays in the commencement of potential mineral production and increased costs of production. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that our activities will result in any profitable mining operations or that we will ever successfully establish mining operations.
We
may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into future potential production.
Our
current and future operations, including additional exploration activities, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations
are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste
disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in mineral property
exploration generally experience increased costs, and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with
applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration and development
activities, will be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. Costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be
prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements
may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing exploration operations to cease
or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial
actions.
Parties
engaged in exploration operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the exploration activities
and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws,
regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could
have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels
of exploration activities at our properties or require abandonment or delays in future activities.
26
We
are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business.
Our
current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations, including:
●
laws and regulations governing
mineral concession acquisition, prospecting, exploration and development and operation;
●
laws and regulations related
to exports, taxes and fees;
●
labor standards and regulations
related to occupational health and mine safety; and
●
environmental standards
and regulations related to waste disposal, toxic substances, land use and environmental protection.
Companies
engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in exploration and other schedules as a result of the need
to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits may result in
enforcement actions, including the forfeiture of mineral claims or other mineral tenures, orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities
requiring operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional
equipment or costly remedial actions. We may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of our mineral exploration
activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws, regulations and permits. Existing and
possible future laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation,
could have a material adverse impact on our business and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in
exploration.
Our
business is subject to extensive environmental regulations that may make exploring, or related activities prohibitively expensive, and
which may change at any time.
All
of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that can substantially delay exploration and make exploration expensive
or prohibit it altogether. We may be subject to potential liabilities associated with the pollution of the environment and the disposal
of waste products that may occur as the result of exploring and other related activities on our properties. We may have to pay to remedy
environmental pollution, which may reduce the amount of money that we have available to use for exploration, or other activities, and
adversely affect our financial position. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend exploration
operations or to enter into interim compliance measures pending the completion of the required remedy. We have not purchased insurance
for potential environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards associated with the disposal of waste
products from our exploration activities) and such insurance may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at a reasonable price.
All of our exploration will be subject to regulation under one or more local, state and federal environmental impact analyses and public
review processes. It is possible that future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory
interpretation could have significant impact on some portion of our business, which may require our business to be economically re-evaluated
from time to time. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that regulatory authorities may increase bonding requirements
beyond our financial capability. Inasmuch as posting of bonding in accordance with regulatory determinations is a condition to the right
to operate under specific federal and state exploration operating permits, increases in bonding requirements could prevent operations
even if we are in full compliance with all substantive environmental laws.
Regulations
and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
A
number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact
of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners
and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting
and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability
to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty
around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our
financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and
any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could
harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular
to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities,
water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial
performance of our operations.
27
The
values of our properties are subject to volatility in the price of gold and any other deposits we may seek or locate.
Our
ability to obtain additional and continuing funding, and our profitability in the event we commence future mining operations or sell
the rights to mine, will be significantly affected by changes in the market price of gold. Gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected
by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control. Some of these factors include the sale or purchase of gold by central banks
and financial institutions; interest rates; currency exchange rates; inflation or deflation; fluctuation in the value of the United States
dollar and other currencies; speculation; global and regional supply and demand, including investment, industrial and jewelry demand;
and the political and economic conditions of major gold or other mineral producing countries throughout the world, such as Russia and
South Africa. The price of gold or other minerals have fluctuated widely in recent years, and a decline in the price of gold could cause
a significant decrease in the value of our properties, limit our ability to raise money, and render continued exploration activities
of our properties impracticable. If that happens, then we could lose our rights to our properties and be compelled to sell some or all
of these rights. Additionally, the future progression of our properties beyond the exploration stage is heavily dependent upon the level
of gold prices remaining sufficiently high to make the continuation of our properties economically viable. A decrease in the price of
gold may adversely affect our financial condition and access to capital and result in a decrease
in our stock price. The greater the decrease in the price of gold, the more likely it is that our stock price will decrease.
Our
property titles may be challenged, and we are not insured against any challenges, impairments or defects to our mineral claims or property
titles.
We
cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and
our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained.
Our unpatented Keystone claims were created and maintained in accordance with the federal General Mining Law of 1872. Unpatented claims
are unique U.S. property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests
because the validity of unpatented claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state
laws and regulations under the General Mining Law. We have obtained a title report on our Keystone claims but cannot be certain that
all defects or conflicts with our title to those claims have been identified. Further, we have not obtained title insurance regarding
our purchase and ownership of the Keystone claims. Defending any challenges to our property titles may be costly and may divert funds
that could otherwise be used for exploration activities and other purposes. We cannot provide any assurances that there are no title
defects affecting our properties. In addition, unpatented claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests
by the federal government, which, if successful, may prevent us from exploiting our discovery of commercially extractable gold. Challenges
to our title may increase its costs of operation or limit our ability to explore on certain portions of our properties. We are not insured
against challenges, impairments or defects to our property titles, nor do we intend to carry extensive title insurance in the future.
Market
forces or unforeseen developments may prevent us from obtaining the supplies and equipment necessary to explore for gold and other minerals.
Gold
exploration, and mineral exploration in general, is a very competitive business. Competitive demands for contractors and unforeseen shortages
of supplies and/or equipment could result in the disruption of our planned exploration activities. Current demand for exploration drilling
services, equipment and supplies is robust and could result in suitable equipment and skilled manpower being unavailable at scheduled
times for our exploration program. The recent inflationary environment has also resulted in a significant increase in costs, including
fuel. If we cannot find the equipment and supplies needed for our various exploration programs, we may have to suspend some or all of
them until equipment, supplies, funds and/or skilled manpower become available. Any such disruption in our activities may adversely affect
our exploration activities and financial condition.
28
Joint
ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks.
We
may enter into future joint ventures or partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration, of a certain portion
of the CK Gold, Keystone and Challis Gold properties, in which we have an interest. Joint ventures can often require unanimous approval
of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered
capital, merger, division, dissolution, amendments of consenting documents, and the pledge of joint venture assets, which means that
each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the
joint venture. Further, we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties. Any failure of
such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties’ respective
rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and therefore could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial performance, cash flows and the price of the Common Shares.
We
may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies, involving our properties or
new properties, which could harm our operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges.
Acquisitions
of other companies or new properties, divestitures, business combinations or other transactions with other companies may create additional,
material risks for our business that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results.
Such risk factors include the effects of possible disruption to the exploration activities and mine planning, loss of value associated
with our properties, mismanagement of project development, additional risk and liability, indemnification obligations, sales of assets
at unfavorable prices, failure to sell non-core assets at all, poor execution of the plans for such transactions, permit requirements,
debt incurred or capital stock issued to enter into such transactions, the impact of any such transactions on our financial results,
negative stakeholder reaction to any such transaction and our ability to successfully integrate an acquired company’s operations
with our operations. If the purchase price of any acquired businesses exceeds the current fair values of the net tangible assets of such
acquired businesses, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could result in significant
impairment and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses
and potential restructuring costs associated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future transactions, or the effect that any such transactions
might have on our operating or financial results. Any potential future transactions will be viewed on their merits by management and
ultimately our Board at the time definitive proposals are received by the Company and viewed relative to the current circumstances of
the Company and its business. Furthermore, potential transactions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management’s attention
and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition, to complete future transactions, we
may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets,
which could adversely affect our profitability.
We
may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, and the failure
to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, we are dependent
upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness.
We
are dependent on a relatively small number of key employees, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial
Officer and our Vice President – Exploration and Technical Services. The loss of any officer could have an adverse effect on us.
We have no life insurance on any individual, and we may be unable to hire a suitable replacement for them on favorable terms, should
that become necessary.
Our
success is also dependent on the contributions of highly skilled and experienced consultants and contractors. Our ability to achieve
our operating goals depends upon our ability to retain such consultants and contractors in order to execute our strategy. There continues
to be competition over highly skilled consultants and contractors in our industry. If we lose key consultants, contractors, or one or
more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows could be harmed.
29
Our
business is dependent upon our consultants and contractors being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical
injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our consultants and contractors are unable to perform their jobs for any reason,
including as a result of illness, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
We
may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our
future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax
rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject
to review or audit by tax authorities. As a result, we may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related
assertions. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.
In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there could
be situations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome
may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods
for which such determination is made.
Our
activities may be adversely affected by unforeseeable and unquantifiable health risks, whether those effects are local, nationwide or
global. Matters outside our control may prevent us from executing on our exploration programs, limit travel of Company representatives,
adversely affect the health and welfare of Company personnel or prevent important vendors and contractors from performing normal and
contracted activities.
The
risks we face related to contagious disease, or policies implemented by governments to protect against the spread of a disease, are unforeseeable
and unquantifiable by us. We, or our people, investors, contractors or stakeholders, may be prevented from free cross-border travel or
normal attendance to activities in conducting Company business at trade shows, presentations, meetings or other activities meant to promote
or execute our business strategy and transactions. We may be prevented from receiving goods or services from contractors. Decisions beyond
our control, such as canceled events, restricted travel, barriers to entry or other factors may affect our ability to accomplish drilling
programs, technical analysis of completed exploration actions, equity raising activities, and other needs that would normally be accomplished
without such limitations.
We
use a variety of outsourced contractors to execute our exploration programs. Drilling contractors need to be able to access our projects
and ensure social distancing recommended safety standards. While our contractors are currently able to access our projects, there can
be no assurances that this access will continue if subsequent waves of the infection or variant strains appear.
As
an exploration and development company with no revenues, we are reliant on constantly raising additional capital to fund our operations.
A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on
our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common
stock. There are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms in the foreseeable future.
We
are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.
We
are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyberattack,
security breach, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized
persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any invasion, cyberattack or security breach results in disruption to our
business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security
risks may not be sufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks, we may suffer such
losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures.
We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation and remediation costs associated with any information security
vulnerabilities, cyberattacks or security breaches.
30
The
Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective,
not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related
to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial position, and results of operations.
RISKS
RELATED TO THE MINERAL EXPLORATION INDUSTRY
Exploring
for gold is an inherently speculative business.
Natural
resource exploration and exploring for gold in particular is a business that by its nature is very speculative. There is a strong possibility
that we will not discover gold or any other resources which can be mined or extracted at a profit. Although we have established the existence
of mineral reserves at the CK Gold Project, we may be unsuccessful in bringing it into production on a profitable basis. Few properties
that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Unusual or unexpected geological formations, geological formation pressures,
fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate
machinery, equipment or labor are just some of the many risks involved in mineral exploration programs and the subsequent expansion of
potential gold deposits.
Estimates
of mineral reserves and mineral resources are subject to evaluation uncertainties that could result in project failure.
Our
exploration and future potential mining operations, if any, are and would be faced with risks associated with being able to accurately
predict the quantity and quality of mineral resources or mineral reserves within the earth using statistical sampling techniques. Estimates
of mineral resources or mineral reserves on our properties are made using samples obtained from appropriately placed trenches, test pits
and underground workings and intelligently designed drilling. There is an inherent variability of assays between check and duplicate
samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. Additionally, there also may be
unknown geologic details that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of accumulated knowledge about our
properties. This could result in uncertainties that cannot be reasonably eliminated from the process of estimating potential mineral
resources/reserves. If these estimates were to prove to be unreliable, we could implement an exploitation plan that may not lead to any
commercially viable operations in the future.
We
may be denied the government licenses and permits which we need to explore or mine on our properties.
Exploration
activities usually require the granting of permits from various governmental agencies. For example, exploration drilling on unpatented
mineral claims requires a permit to be obtained from the United States BLM, which may take several months or longer to grant the requested
permit. Depending on the size, location and scope of the exploration program, additional permits may also be required before exploration
activities can be undertaken. Prehistoric or Native American graveyards, threatened or endangered species, archeological sites or the
possibility thereof, difficult access, excessive dust and important nearby water resources may all result in the need for additional
permits before exploration activities can commence. As with all permitting processes, there is the risk that unexpected delays and excessive
costs may be experienced in obtaining required permits. The needed permits may not be granted at all. Delays in or our inability to obtain
necessary permits will result in unanticipated costs, which may result in serious adverse effects upon our business.
31
Possible
amendments to the General Mining Law and other regulations could make it more difficult or impossible for us to execute our business
plan.
In
recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law, as well as legislation that
would make comprehensive changes to the law. Although no such comprehensive legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance
that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If adopted, such legislation, if it includes concepts that have been part of
previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) limit on the number of millsites that a claimant may use, (ii) impose
time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental
compliance and reclamation requirements on activities on unpatented mining claims and millsites, (iv) establish a mechanism that would
allow states, localities and Native American tribes to petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation
of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation
of the federal lands in question could not be prevented, (vi) impose royalties on gold and other mineral production from unpatented mining
claims or impose fees on production from patented mining claims, and (vii) impose a fee on the amount of material displaced at a mine.
Further, such legislation, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on earnings from our exploration operations, could reduce future
estimates of any reserves we may establish and could curtail our future exploration activity on our unpatented claims.
Our
ability to conduct exploration, and related activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies.
We
may not be able to maintain the infrastructure necessary to conduct exploration and development activities.
Our
exploration and development activities depend upon adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are
important factors which affect capital and operating costs. Climate change or unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government
or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our exploration activities and financial
condition.
We
compete against larger and more experienced companies.
The
mining industry is intensely competitive. Many large mining companies are primarily producers of precious or base metals and may become
interested in the types of deposits and exploration projects on which we are focused, which include gold, silver and other precious metals
deposits or polymetallic deposits containing significant quantities of base metals, including copper. Many of these companies have greater
financial resources, experience and technical capabilities than we do. We may encounter increasing competition from other mining companies
in our efforts to acquire mineral properties and hire experienced mining professionals. Increased competition in our business could adversely
affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable mining properties or prospects for mineral exploration in
the future.
We
rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our exploration operations.
A
significant portion of our exploration operations are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our exploration
operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:
●
negotiating
agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;
●
the
inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;
●
reduced
control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;
●
failure
of a contractor to perform under its agreement;
●
interruption
of exploration operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen
events;
●
failure
of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance;
and
●
problems
of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.
In
addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these
risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
32
Our
exploration activities may be adversely affected by the local climate or seismic events, which could prevent us from gaining access to
our property year-round.
Earthquakes,
heavy rains, snowstorms, wildfires and floods could result in serious damage to or the destruction of facilities, equipment or means
of access to our property, or may otherwise prevent us from conducting exploration activities on our property. There may be short periods
of time when the unpaved portion of the access road is impassible in the event of extreme weather conditions or unusually muddy conditions.
During these periods, it may be difficult or impossible for us to access our property, make repairs, or otherwise conduct exploration
activities on them.
We
may be unable to secure surface access or to purchase required surface rights.
Although
we acquire the rights to some or all of the minerals in the ground subject to the mineral tenures that it acquires, or has a right to
acquire, in most cases it does not thereby acquire any rights to, or ownership of, the surface to the areas covered by such mineral tenures.
In such cases, applicable mining laws usually provide for rights of access to the surface for the purpose of carrying on exploration
activities, however, the enforcement of such rights through the courts can be costly and time consuming. It is necessary to negotiate
surface access or to purchase the surface rights if long-term access is required. There can be no guarantee that, despite having the
right at law to access the surface and carry on exploration activities, we will be able to negotiate satisfactory agreements with any
such existing landowners/occupiers for such access or purchase of such surface rights, and therefore we may be unable to carry out planned
exploration activities. In addition, in circumstances where such access is denied, or no agreement can be reached, we may need to rely
on the assistance of local officials or the courts in such jurisdiction the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with any certainty.
Our inability to secure surface access or purchase required surface rights could materially and adversely affect our timing, cost or
overall ability to develop any potential mineral deposits we may locate.
Global
and regional political and economic conditions could adversely impact the Company’s business.
Political
and economic shifts, both domestic and international, may create uncertainty and pose risks to the Company’s operations. Policies
related to populism, protectionism, economic nationalism, and attitudes toward multinational corporations could result in regulatory
changes, trade barriers, or investment restrictions. Additionally, international trade disputes-including tariffs, counter-tariffs, export
controls, sanctions, and currency regulations-may increase costs and disrupt supply chain, operating model, and customer relationships.
Further,
market volatility, driven by shifts in U.S. and foreign trade policies, fluctuating interest rates, or currency controls may affect gold
prices, capital availability, and investor confidence. Even the perception of these risks could lead to reduced investment, higher production
costs, and operational challenges. If such trends continue, they may have a material adverse effect on the business and financial performance.
RISKS
RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
Our
stock price may be volatile.
The
market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors,
many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
●
results
of our operations and exploration efforts;
●
fluctuation
in the supply of, demand and market price for gold and copper;
●
our
ability to obtain working capital financing;
●
additions
or departures of key personnel;
●
limited
“public float” in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative
pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;
●
our
ability to execute our business plan;
●
sales
of our common stock and decline in demand for our common stock;
●
regulatory
developments;
●
economic
and other external factors;
●
investor
perception of our industry or our prospects; and
●
period-to-period
fluctuations in our financial results.
33
In
addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at a desired price.
Volatility
in the price of our common stock may subject us to securities litigation.
As
discussed above, the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers,
and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs
have initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities.
We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and
could divert management’s attention and resources.
There
is currently a limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that one will ever develop or be sustained.
Although
our common stock is currently quoted on NASDAQ, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will
develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our common stock, the investor may not be able
to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for
our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity of our common stock is limited and may be dependent on the
market perception of our business, among other things. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness
campaigns, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring
us to the awareness of investors may require we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will
be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may
not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an
inflated price relative to our performance due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. If a market should develop,
the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms
may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds
a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees,
taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of
low-priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.
Sales,
offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
Sales
of substantial amounts of the common stock, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market
prices for the common stock. A decline in the market prices of the common stock could impair our ability to raise additional capital
through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. In addition, if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock
in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or upon the exercise of outstanding options
or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” in anticipation of which the market price
of our common stock could decline. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make
it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time
and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.
34
Our
issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in exchange for services would dilute the proportionate
ownership and voting rights of existing stockholders and could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.
Our
Board may generally issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock without further approval by our stockholders,
based upon such factors that our Board may deem relevant at that time. We have also issued securities as payment for services. It is
possible that we will issue additional securities to pay for services in the future. We cannot give you any assurance that we will not
issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances we may deem appropriate at the
time.
Our
articles of incorporation allow for our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which
could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.
Our
Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Board also has the authority to
issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred
stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends
are distributed to the holders of our common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the
redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting
power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common
stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
Anti-takeover
provisions may impede the acquisition of our Company.
Certain
provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination.
These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with, and to obtain the approval of, our
Board in connection with such a transaction. However, certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of us, including
an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result, stockholders who might desire
to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so.
The
Company does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
We
anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect
to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon
any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price
at which stockholders have purchased their shares.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price
and trading volume could decline.
The
trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business. We have relatively little research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional industry analysts
commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts
who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely
decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock
could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
We
may not meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ, which could result in a delisting of our common stock.
Our
common stock is listed on the NASDAQ. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards
that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ. For instance, on November 7, 2019, we received
a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our
common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period between September 26, 2019, through November 6, 2019, we did not meet the minimum
bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the NASDAQ pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On April 3, 2020,
we received notice from the NASDAQ indicating that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2), and the matter is now closed.
35
If
NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could
face significant material adverse consequences including:
●
a
limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
●
a
determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere
to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common
stock;
●
a
limited amount of analyst coverage; and
●
a
decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
Delisting
could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest
and fewer business development opportunities.

1C. CYBERSECURITY
Our
system of internal controls includes consideration of cybersecurity risks. We use technology and control procedures designed to mitigate
cybersecurity risks, with our management team working to monitor, identify, assess, and respond to potential cybersecurity incidents
that may threaten the Company. The system of controls also focuses on security awareness and training for employees with access to Company
systems. Company management periodically reviews system and organization control reports (SOC 1, Type 2) for key outsourced information
systems to ensure that third-party data processing is subject to appropriate controls and security measures.
We
have engaged with a third-party information technology firm to assess our vulnerabilities and help us mitigate cybersecurity-related
risks.
Management
is responsible for the operational oversight of company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, and standards across relevant departments
to assess and help prepare us to address cybersecurity risks. As part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our
safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies
through trainings and necessary implementations.
One
of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our
Board is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and management is responsible for the day-to-day management
of any material risks that may arise. Our Board receives periodic updates from management regarding cybersecurity matters and is notified
between such updates regarding any significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents, if any. We do not believe that there are currently
any known risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us or our business strategy, results of operations
or financial condition.
As
of April 30, 2025, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business
and consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of cybersecurity risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Pursuant
to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other
mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These
reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration
(“MSHA”). During the twelve months period ended April 30, 2025, we and our properties or operations were not subject to regulation
by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
U.S.
Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”),
was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed its legal name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the
Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”), in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization,
and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company. We are a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration
and development properties. We own certain mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone
Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold Project in Idaho. We have established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under
S-K 1300 at our CK Gold Project, where we are conducting exploration and pre-development activities, and all of our activities on our
other properties are exploratory in nature.

Summary
of Activities for the Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2025
During
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, we focused primarily on advancing our CK Gold Project in Wyoming with the final approval of our
surface gold mine permit (mine operation and reclamation plan (“MOP”)) which was conditionally approved in April 2024, subject
to three conditions, which were all satisfied between June 2024 and November 2024, released a revised prefeasibility study in February
2025 and continued engineering studies towards the completion of a feasibility study. We continue to enhance our understanding of the
Keystone Project deposit in Nevada and worked towards the filing of an exploration Plan of Operation on our Challis Gold Project in Idaho.
Management focused on investor relations and awareness, resulting in the completion of an equity financing in December 2024.

May 2024, we received notification from the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department
of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) that we received approval on our MOP, subject to certain
conditions.
●In
June 2024, we satisfied two of the three conditions associated with our MOP with (1) the
approval of our Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and (2) acceptance
by the WDEQ of our reclamation bond.
●In
November 2024, we received final permit approval from the Air Quality Division of the WDEQ.
With this approval, the last of the three conditions associated with the recently granted
MOP has been fulfilled.
●On
February 11, 2025, we released the results of our revised prefeasibility study and published
our Technical Summary Report in accordance with S-K 1300.
Sales
of Common Shares to raise a total of $10.2 million in cash
On
November 27, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional
and accredited investors in connection with a registered direct offering of 1,457,700 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.00
per share and warrants to purchase 728,850 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $9.50 per share (the “Registered
Offering”). The warrants are exercisable on May 27, 2025 and will expire on November 27, 2027. The aggregate gross proceeds of
the Registered Offering was approximately $10.2 million. The closing of the Registered Offering occurred on December 6, 2024.
Shareholder
Meeting, Appointment of Directors and Corporate Matters
On
April 28, 2025, we held our annual meeting of stockholders. At that meeting, among other matters, shareholders re-elected to our Board
the five incumbent Directors: Mr. Norman, Mr. Bee, Mr. Schafer, Mr. Waldkirch and Ms. Fipke. Each of the elected Directors will hold
office until the next meeting of stockholders and until their successors are named and qualified or until their earlier resignation or
removal. The stockholders also ratified the appointment of our audit firm for our fiscal year ended April 30, 2025. The stockholders
also approved, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of our named executive officers. Lastly, the stockholders also approved,
by a non-binding advisory vote, the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. Based on
these results and consistent with our recommendation, our Board has determined that we will conduct future advisory votes on the compensation
of our named executive officers every three years. This policy will remain in effect until the next stockholder vote on the frequency
of advisory votes on executive compensation, which is expected to occur at our 2031 annual meeting of stockholders.

Net
Revenues
We
are a development-stage company with no operations, and we did not generate any revenues for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.

Operating
Expenses
Total
operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, were approximately
$13,006,000 and $7,257,000, respectively. The approximate $5,749,000 increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30,
2025, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, is comprised of (i) an increase in compensation of approximately $842,000
primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation related to RSUs, DSUs and stock option grants to officers and employees during
the year ended April 30, 2025 and annual bonus payments, (ii) an increase of approximately $951,000 in exploration expenses on our mineral
properties due to the increase in exploration activities and related consulting expenses at our CK Gold property, (iii) an increase in
professional and consulting fees of approximately $1,471,000 primarily due to an increase in general strategic, permitting and engineering
studies and consulting services of approximately $1,012,000, an increase in stock-based consulting expenses of approximately $256,000,
and an increase in director fees, including stock-based director fees, of approximately $618,000, offset by a decrease in legal fees
of approximately $4,000, a decrease in investor relation fees of approximately $337,000 and a decrease in accounting fees of approximately
$74,000 and (iv) an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $2,484,000 due primarily to an increase in advertising
expenses of approximately $2,175,000 and insurance expenses of approximately $244,000.
Loss
from Operations
We
reported a loss from operations of approximately $13,006,000 and $7,257,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Other
Income (Loss)
We
reported other income (loss) of approximately ($7,554,000) and $360,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
We reported a change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately ($7,714,000) and $314,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30,
2025 and 2024, respectively. We reported interest income and gain from settlement of asset retirement obligation of approximately $161,000
and $0, respectively, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, as compared to approximately $40,000 and $6,000, respectively, during
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.
Net
Loss
We
reported a net loss of approximately $20,559,000 and $6,897,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Working Capital

As
of April 30, 2025, we had working capital of $8,015,445, as compared to working capital of $6,070,321 as of April 30, 2024, an increase
of $1,945,124.
We
are obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the rules subsequently
implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including
requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect to spend between $175,000 and $250,000 in legal and accounting expenses
annually to comply with our reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations.
39
Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in
the normal course of business. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we incurred net losses in the amounts of approximately
$20,559,000 and $6,897,000, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, cash used in operating activities was approximately
$9,872,000. As of April 30, 2025, we had cash of approximately $8,169,000, working capital of approximately $8,015,000, and an accumulated
deficit of approximately $93,407,000. Our primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financing. As of April 30,
2025, we may have sufficient cash to fund our corporate activities, general and administrative costs, and currently undertaken project
activities related to permitting and engineering studies over the next twelve months. However, in order to advance any of our projects
past the aforementioned objectives, we do not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.
Cash
Used in Operating Activities
Net
cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $9,872,000 and $7,076,000 for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024,
respectively. Net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, increased primarily due to the (i) increase
in net loss of approximately $13,662,000 as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, (ii) increase in non-cash items of approximately
$9,385,000 as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant liability and stock-based
compensation and (iii) decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1,481,000 as compared to the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2024 primarily due to changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, reclamation bond deposit, and changes
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Cash
Used in Investing Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities during the year fiscal ended April 30, 2025 was approximately $6,000 for the purchase of property and
equipment as compared to $0 during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024.
Cash
Provided by Financing Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $12,473,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025 primarily due to the
sale of our common stock and warrants for approximately $10,146,000 in December 2024, net of offering costs and proceeds received from
the exercise of stock warrants of approximately $2,327,000. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $4,828,000
for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 due to the sale of our common stock and warrants for approximately $4,828,000 in April
2024, net of offering costs.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
As
of April 30, 2025, we did not have, and do not have any present plans to implement, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting
pronouncements.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual
results may differ significantly from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below,
including, to the extent material and reasonably available, the impact such estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on
our financial condition or results of operations.
40
Share-Based
Compensation
Share-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”),
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Mineral
Rights
Costs
of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. We expense all mineral exploration
costs as incurred. Where we have identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of our properties, development costs will be
capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) we receive the requisite operating permits, b) completion of a favorable
Feasibility Study and c) approval from our Board authorizing the development of the ore body. Until such time all these criteria have
been met, we record pre-development costs to expense as incurred.
When
a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven
and probable reserves following the commencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties
for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”, and evaluates its carrying value under ASC 930-360, “Extractive
Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount
of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value.
To
date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above
for capitalization.
ASC
930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights
consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include
mineral rights.
Acquired
mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value
as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral
rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.
ASC
930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:
●
The
value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining
the fair value of the assets.
●
The
effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of
market participants.
Leases
to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.
Warrant
Liability
We
account for the warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023, respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives
and Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as
a liability. Accordingly, we classify these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value
at each reporting period. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any
change in fair value will be recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo
simulation model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
U.S.
Gold Corp.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of U.S. Gold Corp. (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2025 and 2024,
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in
the period ended April 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30,
2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2025, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Explanatory
Paragraph – Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more
fully described in Note 3, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise
additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization
U.S.
Gold Corp., formerly known as Dataram Corporation (the “Company”), was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey
in 1967 and was subsequently re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 2016. Effective June 26, 2017, the Company changed
its name to U.S. Gold Corp. from Dataram Corporation. On May 23, 2017, the Company merged with Gold King Corp. (“Gold King”),
in a transaction treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization, and the business of Gold King became the business of the Company.
The Company is a gold and precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development properties. The Company owns certain
mining leases and other mineral rights comprising the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project in Nevada and the Challis Gold
Project in Idaho. The Company has established an estimate of proven and probable mineral reserves under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“S-K 1300”) at its CK Gold Project, where the Company is conducting
exploration and pre-development activities, and all of its activities on its other properties are exploratory in nature.
The
Company’s CK Gold property contains proven and probable mineral reserves and accordingly is classified as a development stage property,
as defined in S-K 1300. None of the Company’s other properties contain proven and probable mineral reserves and all activities
are exploratory in nature.
Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company” refer to U.S. Gold Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation and principles of consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-K, and the rules and regulations of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for financial information, which includes the consolidated financial
statements and presents the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of April 30, 2025.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. It is management’s opinion that all material adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions
In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual
results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, valuation
of mineral rights, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock, valuation of warrant liability, asset retirement obligations
and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company has adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
about such fair value measurements.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
These
inputs are prioritized below:
Level
1:
Observable
inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2:
Observable
market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level
3:
Unobservable
inputs for which there is little or no market data, which, require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s
(“FASB”) accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are classified in
their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The
Company’s warrant liability for warrants issued in connection with equity financings in March 2022 and April 2023 (see Note 9)
was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using Level 3 inputs.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company did
not have any cash equivalents on hand at April 30, 2025 and 2024. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.
The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to
$250,000. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least annually, the
rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had bank balances of approximately
$7.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts.
Prepaid
expenses and other current assets
Prepaid
expenses and other current assets of $726,631 and $948,833 at April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid
for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses principally include prepayments in cash and equity instruments for
consulting, public relations, business advisory services, insurance premiums, mining claim fees, easement fees, options fees, and mineral
lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.
Property
Property
is carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are
capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any
resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of the assets, generally three
3
to five
years.
Impairment
of long-lived assets
The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s
estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not recognize any impairment during the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024.
Mineral
Rights
Costs
of leasing, exploring, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral
exploration costs as incurred. Where the Company has identified proven and probable mineral reserves on any of its properties, development
costs will be capitalized when all the following criteria have been met, a) the Company receives the requisite operating permits, b)
completion of a favorable Feasibility Study and c) approval from the Board of director’s authorizing the development of the ore
body. Until such time all these criteria have been met the Company records pre-development costs to expense as incurred.
When
a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven
and probable reserves following the commencement of production. The Company assesses the carrying costs of the capitalized mineral properties
for impairment under ASC 360-10, “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets”, and evaluates their carrying value under ASC 930-360,
“Extractive Activities—Mining”, annually. An impairment is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral properties. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying
amount of the mineral properties over its estimated fair value.

GOLD CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL
30, 2025
To
date, the Company has expensed all exploration and pre-development costs as none of its properties have satisfied the criteria above
for capitalization.
ASC
930-805, “Extractive Activities—Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral rights
consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include
mineral rights.
Acquired
mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value
as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral
rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.
ASC
930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:
●
The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining
the fair value of the assets.
●
The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of
market participants.
Leases
to explore for or use of natural resources are outside the scope of ASC 842, “Leases”.
Share-Based
Compensation
Share-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”),
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Accounting
for Warrants
Warrants
are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC
815”) as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments, depending on the specific terms of the agreements. The Company
classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of
net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company classifies as assets or
liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs
and if that event is outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement
in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Instruments that are classified as liabilities are recorded at fair value at
each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the
consolidated statements of operations.
The
Company assessed the classification of its outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of the date of issuance and determined that
such instruments, except for the warrants discussed under Warrant Liability below, met the criteria for equity classification under the
guidance in ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”; ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”; ASC 815, “Derivatives
and Hedging”. The Company has no outstanding warrants that contain a “down round” feature under ASC 815-10.
Warrant
Liability
The
Company accounts for the 625,000 warrants and 870,000 warrants issued in March 2022 and April 2023 (the “Warrant Agreements”),
respectively, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” whereby under that provision
these warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability (see Note 9). Accordingly, the Company
classifies these warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period.
This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will
be recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation
model. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period (see Notes 9 and 14).

Offering
Costs
Offering
costs incurred consisted of legal, placement agent fees and other costs that were directly related to registered direct offerings. Offering
costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the registered direct offering based on the same proportion as
the proceeds were allocated to the warrants and equity. Offering costs associated with warrant liabilities are expensed as incurred,
presented as offering costs related to warrant liability in the consolidated statements of operations. Offering costs associated with
the sale of common shares are charged against equity.
Remediation
and Asset Retirement Obligation
Asset
retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated reclamation costs at the Company’s CK Gold and Keystone
properties, are recognized in the period incurred and when a reasonable estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value.
Such obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through
charges to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. AROs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company reviews and evaluates
its AROs annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary.
Foreign
Currency Transactions
The
reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains and
losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency included
in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments, and transaction gains or losses, have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company and are included in general and administrative expenses.
Leases
The
Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Operating lease right of use assets (“ROU”) represent
the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the
future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses
an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments.
Upon the election by the Company to extend the lease for additional years, that election will be treated as a lease modification and
the lease will be reviewed for re-measurement. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”),
which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets
for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.
The
Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions” (“ASC 740-10”).
When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be
ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements
in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions.

Tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than
50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with
tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company
has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits or for any related interest and penalties. In the event that the Company is assessed
penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense.
The
Company follows ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether
a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position
can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions
considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered
more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities,
generally for three years after they are filed.
Segment
Information
The
Company is engaged in the exploration and evaluation of its mineral properties. In accordance with ASC 280 — Segment Reporting,
the Company has determined that it operates in one operating and reportable segment. Operating segments are defined as components of
an entity where discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM). This determination
is based on the manner in which the CODM, identified as the Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions, allocates resources and
assesses financial performance.
All
activities are related to the exploration and evaluation of mineral properties, and the Company has not commenced commercial operations
or generated revenues to date. Internal reporting and decision-making are performed, and all financial results are reviewed on a consolidated
basis by the CODM, without differentiation by individual exploration property. The single segment constitutes all the consolidated entity,
and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements are representative
of such amounts. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company operated in one operating segment.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material
effect on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have
an effect on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.
In
June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2022-03”). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify
that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security
and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account,
recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities
subject to contractual sale restrictions. The provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard
to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In
November 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU No. 2023-07”), Segment reporting (Topic 280): Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which amended Topic 280. The amendments in this update enhance segment
reporting by expanding the breadth and frequency of segment disclosures required by public entities. ASU 2023-07 requires public
entities to disclose factors used to identify the entities’ reportable segments, how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)
uses the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss to assess segment performance and decide how to allocate resources,
significant expenses regularly provided to the CODM and included within the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss,
types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues, and the title and position of the CODM. The new
standard is effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and is required to be adopted retrospectively for all prior periods
presented in the consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this ASU only impacted disclosures with no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted this ASU effective May 1, 2024; see Segment Information above.

In
December 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The
standard enhances income tax disclosure requirements for all entities by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within
the rate reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax positions
and related financial statement impacts. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.
In
March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its final rule, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related
Disclosures for Investors that requires the Company to provide certain climate-related information in its registration statements and
annual reports. The rule provided a phased-in compliance period and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,
with early adoption permitted. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the final rule pending completion of judicial review
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and, therefore, the timing of the effectiveness of these disclosure requirements
is uncertain. The Company is currently monitoring the timing of adoption and evaluating the impact of the potential adoption of this
standard on its consolidated financial statements.
On November
4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 Subtopic 220-40 – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU
2024-03”) to improve the disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for
more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation,
amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions (such as cost of sales, SG&A, and research and development).
ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027,
and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2024-03 may have on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
NOTE
3 — GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of April 30, 2025, the Company had cash of approximately $8.2
million, working capital of approximately $8.0 million which consists primarily of cash and prepaid expenses and other current assets
and an accumulated deficit of approximately $93.4 million. The Company had a net loss and cash used in operating activities of approximately
$20.6 million and $9.9 million, respectively, for the year ended April 30, 2025. As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating
activities, and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. The Company’s primary
source of operating funds since inception has been equity financing. As noted in Note 10, in November 2024, the Company completed a registered
offering which raised total gross proceeds of approximately $10.2 million before deducting fees
and other estimated offering expenses. As of the date of filing the annual report for the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company
has sufficient cash to fund its corporate activities and general and administrative costs and currently undertaken project activities
related to permitting and engineering studies. However, in order to advance any of its projects past the aforementioned objectives the
Company does not have sufficient cash and will need to raise additional funds. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or
the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

8 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On
March 10, 2021, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement (the “March 2021 Agreement”) with Luke Norman Consulting
Ltd. (“Norman Consulting”), an entity controlled by Luke Norman, who subsequently was appointed as a director of the Company
on May 18, 2022, to provide services related to investor and strategic introductions for potential mergers and acquisitions and other
potential and strategic relationships to add shareholder value. On March 10, 2022, the Company and Norman Consulting mutually agreed
to extend the March 2021 Agreement for an additional 12 months (the “March 2022 Extension”). On March 10, 2023, the Company
and Norman Consulting further extended the March 2021 Agreement for another 12 months (the “March 2023 Extension”). The terms
of the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension remain the same as stipulated in the March 2021 Agreement. In consideration
for the services provided pursuant to the March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension, Norman Consulting was paid an annual fee
of $250,000 consisting of shares of the Company’s common stock with a value of $130,000 paid within five days of the effective
date of the applicable extension, and cash payments of $120,000, paid in increments of $10,000 per month. In April 2022 and March 2023,
the Company issued 14,286 shares and 33,419 shares of common stock pursuant to March 2022 Extension and the March 2023 Extension, respectively,
to Norman Consulting.
On
November 25, 2024, the Company and Norman Consulting entered into a consulting agreement (the “November 2024 Agreement”)
for an initial term of 12 months, which shall automatically renew for successive 12-month period unless terminated by the Company. As
compensation for services rendered by Norman Consulting to the Company in connection with the November 2024 Agreement, the Company shall
pay Norman Consulting an annual consulting fee of $250,000, which shall be paid in equal monthly installments. Additionally, Norman Consulting
shall be entitled to receive payments upon the occurrence of a “transformative transaction” (as defined in the November 2024
Agreement). The Company also agreed to compensate Norman Consulting for its past services to the Company from March 2024 to October 2024
by (i) issuing 19,779 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock to Norman Consulting and (ii) paying a lump-sum cash payment
of $65,000 to Norman Consulting. The Company paid consulting fees to Norman Consulting of $210,833 and $100,000 in cash during the year
ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Additionally, as of April 30, 2025, the Company recorded accounts payable and accrued expenses,
including stock payable totaling $199,412 due to Norman Consulting that was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
NOTE
9 — WARRANT LIABILITY
As
of April 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s warrant liabilities were valued at $11,631,100 and $3,916,900, respectively. Under the
guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the warrant
holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the completion of a “fundamental transaction.” A fundamental
transaction, as defined in the warrants, includes (a) any merger or consolidation by and between the Company and another Person, (b)
the sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, (c) the completion of any tender offer or exchange
offer pursuant to which the holders of greater than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock has agreed to tender or exchange
their securities, and (d) the consummation of a stock purchase agreement or other business combination whereby another Person acquires
more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In the event of a fundamental transaction, the holder of the
warrant has the right to require that the Company purchase the warrant from the holder by paying the holder an amount of cash equal to
a valuation based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model reflecting an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% or the 100-day
volatility as of the trading day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable fundamental transaction. This volatility
input precludes the Company from applying equity accounting as the warrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that is greater
than a holder of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that liability accounting is required.

As
such, these warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change in fair value reported within other income
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as “Change in fair value of warrant liability” until the warrants
are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders’ equity.
The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation model to estimate the fair values of the April 2023 and March 2022 warrants, which incorporates
significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable
inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions
that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value by using the below
key inputs to the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The
Company accounted for the 625,000 warrants issued on March 18, 2022, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives
and Hedging” whereby under that provision these warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment and were recorded as a
liability. The initial valuation of these warrants was valued at $3,652,000 on March 18, 2022. Additionally, the Company accounted for
the 870,000 warrants issued on April 10, 2023, in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging”
whereby under that provision these warrants did not meet the criteria for equity treatment and were recorded as a liability at an initial
valuation of $3,088,500.

in cash if certain extraordinary events are affected by the Company, including a 50% or greater change of control in the Company’s
common stock. Such payment in cash shall be equal to the black-scholes value as defined in the warrant agreement. These
870,000 warrants were recorded as warrant liability as of April 30, 2025 and 2024 (see Notes 9 and 14).
Additionally,
on April 10, 2023, the Company agreed to amend, effective as of the closing of a registered offering, 625,000 warrants which was initially

11 — NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Net
loss per share of common stock is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”. Basic loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss available to common stockholder, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. The following were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact
on the Company’s net loss. In periods where the Company has a net loss, all dilutive securities are excluded.

Exploration
Access and Option to Lease Agreement
On
August 25, 2021 (“Effective Date”), the Company entered into an Exploration Access and Option to Lease Agreement (the “Agreement”)
with a private-party landowner (the “Landowner”) whereby the Landowner granted the Company an option (the “Option”)
to lease and right of way on a property located in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Company may exercise the Option for five years (“Option
Term”) from the Effective Date. During the Option, the Landowner granted non-exclusive rights (the “Exploration Access Rights”)
to the Company to use the surface of the property for an annual exploration and access right payment of $10,000, thirty days after the
effective date and each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the Option Term until such time the Option is exercised
or expires. The Company is also required to pay an annual Option payment of $35,780 for the lease and $6,560 for the right of way within
thirty days after the Effective Date and each year on the anniversary of the Effective Date during the Option Term until such time the
Option is exercised by the Company or expires. The Company paid a total of $42,340 for each of the periods ended on September 1, 2021,
2022, 2023 and 2024, pursuant to this Agreement.
At
any time during the Option Term, the Company may exercise the Option by providing a written notice to the Landowner and the Company shall
pay a one-time right-of-way payment of $26,240 at closing and shall execute a lease agreement. The exclusive option to lease (the “Lease”)
and right of way (the “Right of Way”) is for a term of ten years with the right to extend for an additional ten years and
requires an annual lease payment of $50,000, compensation for loss of grazing of $40.00 per acre impacted land and annual Right of Way
payments of $13,120.
In
consideration for the option rights, lease rights and right of way rights under this Agreement, the Company agreed to grant the Landowner
shares of the Company’s common stock worth $50,000, which shares will not vest, or be issued, until the Company executes the Lease.
Currently, the Company has not executed the Lease.
At
any time during the Option Term, the Company may terminate this Agreement by providing a written notice to the Landowner. Upon termination,
the Landowner is entitled to retain any payments already made and the Company shall have no further obligation after the date of termination.
The Agreement, including the Option and the Exploration Access Rights, may be extended for a period of five years upon written notice
from the Company. In the absence of such notice, the Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the Option Term. Currently,
the Company has not exercised the Option.

The
Company has a net operating loss carryforward for federal tax purposes totaling approximately $69.4 million at April 30, 2025. Approximately
$11.3 million expires between the years 2029 and 2038, with approximately $58.1 million net operating losses incurred after December
31, 2017 that do not expire and can be utilized to offset up to 80% of future taxable income. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had identified
certain adjustments that were required to past tax return filings, including those related to capitalized exploration expenses and share-based
compensation. These adjustments were made to the Company’s net operating loss carryforward in the federal tax return for the year
ended April 30, 2023. These adjustments are reflected in the carryforward amounts disclosed above. The Company does not have any state
net operating loss carryforwards. The Company primarily operates in the states of Wyoming and Nevada which do not impose a corporate
income tax. Any minor apportionment that may occur to any other taxable state will be immaterial to current and future operations of
the Company. Therefore, the effective state tax rate used in the calculation of the Company’s deferred tax is 0%.
On
August 10, 2020, the Company acquired mineral rights totaling $10,249,632 (see Note 4 — Mineral Rights) in a tax-free reorganization
pursuant to IRC Section 368. The Company recorded the assets at fair value for financial reporting purposes and retained the seller’s
tax basis which was zero resulting in a deferred tax liability on the business combination date. As required by ASC 740, the Company
has recognized the deferred tax impact of acquiring the mineral rights asset in this transaction, with the amount paid exceeding the
tax basis of the asset on the acquisition date. A portion of the deferred tax liability is offset by deferred tax assets recognized by
the Company. The remaining portion of the deferred tax liability is not offset by deferred tax assets due to the indefinite life of the
mineral rights. As of April 30, 2025, the Company’s remaining net deferred tax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance
as management is unable to conclude that it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will expire unrealized.

The
Company has assessed its tax positions and has determined that it has not taken a position that would give rise to an unrecognized tax
liability being reported. In the event that the Company is assessed penalties and/or interest, penalties will be charged to other operating
expenses and interest will be charged to interest expense.
The
Company operates exclusively in the United States and in various state jurisdictions, primarily the states of Wyoming and Nevada. For
both federal and state income tax purposes, the Company’s fiscal 2022 through 2025 tax years remain open for examination by the
tax authorities under the general three-year statute of limitations. However, due to the Company’s federal net operating loss carryforward,
the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to adjust this carryforward even if the losses were incurred in years that would otherwise
be closed under the statute of limitations.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management
necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of April 30, 2025. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Our
internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over
financial reporting as of April 30, 2025. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the
document entitled “2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, (“COSO”). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report,
such internal controls and procedures were effective as of April 30, 2025.
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm as we are
a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the report.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
