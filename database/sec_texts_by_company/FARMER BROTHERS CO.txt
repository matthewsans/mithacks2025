In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,” “expects,” “plans,” “believes,” “intends,” “will,” “could,” “may,” “assumes” and other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions, estimates and observations of future events based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made and include any statements that do not relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Business StrategyOverviewWe are a coffee company dedicated to delivering the coffee people want, the way they want it. We build partnerships with customers who value quality, a wide array of services and sustainable sourcing and are passionate about delivering great coffee, tea, and culinary experiences to their communities.In order to achieve our mission, increase cash optimization, and improve margins, we have grown existing capabilities and continue to develop new capabilities to deliver value to our customers. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following:•Executing Manufacturing and Network Optimization. We continue to develop and execute manufacturing network optimization. We utilize our Portland, Oregon, facility and separate distribution centers, including our Rialto, California distribution center, to improve production efficiencies and balance volume across our manufacturing and distribution networks to facilitate sustainable long-term growth. We execute branch and route rationalization, optimize 1product offerings through SKU rationalization, individualize customer delivery methods, and enhance inventory management, which improves our cost structure without sacrificing service to our customers.•Leveraging our Direct-Store-Delivery Network for growth.
The Company's nationwide direct-store-delivery ("DSD") network is central to our operational framework, and we are continuously working on enhancements to drive profitability, ensure customer retention and utilize our national reach to improve inventory management across our network. Such enhancements include optimizing the management of the route network to focus on business development, higher profitable sales and customer penetration; while utilizing key performance indicators to create better focus, accountability and alignment toward business objectives. Additionally, we are focused on building partnerships that utilize our current distribution capabilities to expose us to industry and product innovation. •Product Innovation Pipeline. We are continuing to enhance our premium and specialty coffee and tea programs, developing strategic partnerships, and building an advantaged allied product portfolio that resonates with our customers. We will continue to provide leadership in sustainable product solutions for our customers.•Driving Customer Satisfaction. Providing our customers the products they want, when they want them, is key to customer satisfaction and retention. We have invested in systems and processes to improve our ability to service our customers. We are driving continuous improvement on “On-Time and In-Full” and other key service metrics. In addition, we are focused on optimizing our product commercialization process and bringing innovation to our customers.•Service Excellence in Revive Service & Restoration ("Revive"). We continue to have one of the largest coffee service networks in the industry and are able to install, repair, and refurbish commercial brewing equipment. We are focused on continually improving time-to-install, time-to-repair and restoration of equipment. We have built relationships with leading equipment manufacturers and are invested in training our team on the latest equipment offerings to enhance our service capabilities and ability to add value.•Enhance Processes and Systems. We are implementing IT applications which we expect will enhance our supply chain optimization and flexibility.
Additionally, we continue to invest in and improve other IT capabilities to provide back-office support which will enable enhanced customer analytics, better product targeting and pricing, and create a more robust demand and supply process. We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by providing coffee, tea, and culinary expertise, service excellence, and equipment program support. We tailor solutions to our customers' needs, helping them deliver a positive experience for their own customers, including by: •Offering a wide variety of sustainably sourced coffee, tea, and culinary products, thereby helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals and objectives;•Providing consumer, channel, and market insights, including ideation to support customer menu and product evaluation in line with consumer trends;•Delivering comprehensive commercial brewing equipment program support from installation to preventative maintenance to timely repair;•Providing DSD service where our trained Route Sales Representatives ("RSR") order product to keep our customers inventory in-stock, merchandises the beverage station, rotates products, cleans and inspects equipment on-site, and performs “cup quality checks,” all to ensure a positive experience for the consumer. Our services provided to DSD customers are conducted primarily in person through our RSRs, who develop business relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations; and •Providing comprehensive coffee programs to our key account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing, limited time specialty products, packaging design and supply chain management.Industry and Market LeadershipWe have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee, tea and allied product knowledge to grow our business:•Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation with the Specialty Coffee Association, National Coffee Association, Coffee Quality Institute, International Women's Coffee Alliance, Alliance for Coffee Excellence, Global Coffee Platform and Pacific Coast Coffee Association, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. •Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have internally developed a market insight capability that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee, tea and food service industries. We invest in 2proprietary consumer and customer segmentation studies and provide trend insights and product development support that helps our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies. We are focused on understanding key demographic groups and their attitudes and behaviors to better position the Company as a consumer brand at retail and meet the market needs of all our customers.
Sustainability Leadership•Sustainability. We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee and tea programs that include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and packaging material reductions. •Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® Program. In fiscal 2025, we continued to utilize our direct trade sourcing model, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®. This program involves direct long-term partnerships with coffee growing communities based on principles of sustainability, transparent pricing and consumer education. This model is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework verified as responsibly sourced through Enveritas. The result of this evaluation impacts where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us.
Overall, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®
builds community partnerships for decision making, training, and reporting that benefits all members of the coffee supply chain.•Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, we track traceability levels from all green coffee suppliers on a per-contract basis. We believe this helps us bring transparency to our supply chain, rank our suppliers, and also to identify opportunities to select trusted providers, cooperatives, mills, exporters, and other suppliers, when offering sustainable coffees to our customers. It also helps us deepen our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions generated upstream in our supply chain. We have joined the Global Coffee platform to continue to be part of the global industry and driving responsible sourcing standards forward globally.•Supplier Sustainability. We are committed to working with suppliers who share our social, environmental and economic sustainability goals. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when suppliers are not held to the same strict standards to which we hold ourselves. To address this concern, all existing suppliers and new suppliers must acknowledge and adhere to our Supplier Standards of Engagement. These Standards of Engagement set minimum standards for suppliers that are designed to provide Farmer Bros. visibility into all aspects of its supply chain and meets these objectives.
Charitable ActivitiesWe view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model. We support the communities where our customers, team members, businesses, and suppliers call home, with an emphasis on providing and supporting supply chain stability and a focus on food security.Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions).•Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks.•Our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging that can be donated are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to keep all edible food waste from going to landfills.Human CapitalOn June 30, 2025, we employed approximately 865 employees, 198 of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring on or before January 31, 2028. Achieving our vision of building a leading specialty products distributor and service company starts with our people. We believe our human capital management philosophy and programs align with developing and sustaining a culture that embraces our team member values of family, service and quality, collaboration, simplicity and sustainability.
3We continue to attract, develop and retain our team members with the following programs: Team Member BenefitsWe value each team member and, as a result, we provide a Total Rewards Program that strives to deliver the features that our team members value. Based on team member feedback and in alignment with our values of family, we have emphasized: •Stability of our team member benefits costs and expansion of the scope of our benefit programs and options. This has included company-paid short-term disability as well as paid parental leave for all non-union team members.
•Focused improvement of our overall team member experience, including investments in HR technology, well-being initiatives and a comprehensive Benefits Assistance Center to help employees understand their benefits better.Health and Safety The health and safety of our team members is crucial. In addition to tracking common indicators, such as injury rates, we have taken a proactive approach to work place safety, including regular company-wide safety training, extensive driver safety curriculum to help keep our team members and others safer on the road, and fleet safety reviews. We will continue to focus on all aspects of team member health and safety by creating a Safety First Culture. This includes, but is not limited to, tracking and analyzing injury rates and incident trends, safety training, and team member engagement in the safety process. Raw Materials and SuppliesOur primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Our principal packaging materials include carton board, corrugate and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities.We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade and Fair Trade Certified™® sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. Fair Trade Certified™® provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to individual coffee growers instead of to cooperatives, providing these farmers with price premiums and dedicated technical assistance to improve farm conditions and increase both quality and productivity of sustainable coffee crops at the individual farm level. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements, vendor agreements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 4, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. Intellectual PropertyWe own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, and other proprietary rights that are not registered.SeasonalityWe experience some seasonal influences. The winter months historically have generally been our strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from retailers ramping up inventory for the winter selling season. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.DistributionWe operate production and distribution facilities in Portland, Oregon. Distribution takes place out of the Portland facility, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Rialto, California; and Moonachie, New Jersey. Our products reach our customers primarily through our nationwide DSD network of over 200 delivery routes and over 90 storage locations 4as of June 30, 2025. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on third-party logistics service providers ("3PL") for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our websites and sell certain products at retail and through foodservice distributors. CustomersWe serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers and large national account customers like restaurant, department and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as retail with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, foodservice distributors, and consumers through e-commerce. During fiscal 2025, our top five customers accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales. Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are “price” buyers, seeking a low-cost provider with less concern for service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. Historically, our product returns have not been significant.Competition and TrendsThe coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, certain of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee) and The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee), wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods Holding Corp., regional and national coffee roasters such as Westrock Coffee Company, Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Trilliant Food and Nutrition LLC, Gaviña & Sons, Inc., Royal Cup, Inc., Ronnoco Coffee, LLC, and Community Coffee Company, L.L.C., specialty coffee suppliers such as Rogers Family Company (San Francisco Bay Coffee), Distant Lands Coffee Company, Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and JAB Holding Company (Peet’s Coffee & Tea), and retail brand beverage manufacturers such as Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam’s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages.We believe our longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution and equipment service network, industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We believe we compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition. Regulatory EnvironmentThe conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" under the sub-captions "Risks Related to Our Business and Industry" and "Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Matters."OtherThe nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.Available InformationOur Internet website address is http://www.farmerbros.com, where we make available, free of charge, through a link maintained on our website under the heading “Investor Relations—SEC Filings,” copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, including amendments thereto, proxy statements and annual reports to stockholders, and from time to time, other documents, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC. In addition, these reports and the other documents we file with the 5SEC are available at a website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.

Item 1A.Risk FactorsYou should carefully consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this report, in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively affect our business operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDisruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn periods of rising or high inflation, rising interest rates, or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect customer and consumer spending, as well as demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Global economic conditions can be uncertain and volatile. Our business and results of operations have in the past been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions including inflation, interest rates, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by public health crises, such as global health pandemics, as well as the potential impacts of geopolitical uncertainties, and the effect of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Most of our products are purchased by our customers based on end-user demand from consumers. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include general economic conditions, high levels of unemployment, health crises, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, inflationary pressure, tax rates, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Political environments may create uncertainty with respect to, and could result in additional changes in, legislation, regulation, international relations and government policy, or could result in possible civil unrest or other disturbances. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration announced the implementation of significant new tariffs on foreign imported goods, certain of which recently went into effect. In response to the U.S. tariffs, various jurisdictions, including China, Canada and the EU, have announced plans for their own tariffs on American products. If such increased or additional tariffs or other restrictions, quotas, embargoes, or safeguards are placed on goods imported into the United States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, we may have to raise our prices or increase inventory levels, or find new sources of supply for raw materials (including green coffee) that we import. There is no assurance that we would be able to pass on any cost increases, in full or at all, any of which could materially affect our revenue, gross margin and results of operations.We cannot predict future trade policy and regulations in the United States and other countries, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business. A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or raw materials used in our products (including green coffee) imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the sales, cost or gross margin of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products may be diminished. Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and regulations as well as disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending and negatively affect demand for our products.We depend on the expertise of key personnel to operate our business. The unexpected loss of one or more of these key employees or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and competitive position.Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of key personnel and a consistent workforce, including frontline workers, support staff and executive team members. The competition for talent is extremely high and candidates’ preferences and expectations are evolving. We must continue to recruit, retain, motivate and develop management and other employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth and strategic initiatives. This may require us to adapt to evolving labor conditions and make significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. In this competitive environment, our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding 6wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees and to invest in our employee experience and culture, and we may never realize returns on these investments. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. If we are not able to effectively retain our talent, our ability to achieve certain strategic objectives may be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, any unplanned turnover or failure to develop or implement an adequate succession plan for our senior management and other key employees, could deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage, and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage these transitions successfully. From time to time, there may be changes to our executive leadership team and senior management for various reasons, including as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel. Such changes may adversely impact our operations, programs, growth, financial condition and results of operations. Over the past few years, we had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of organizational changes, including the transition of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer and the departure of our former chief human resources officer and chief field operations officer. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully manage changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed.Competition in the coffee industry and beverage category could impact our profitability or harm our competitive position.The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional and national coffee roasters, specialty coffee suppliers, and retail brand beverage manufacturers, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than us. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores and on-line retailers. Companies smaller than ours may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets.We consider our roasting and blending methods essential to the flavor and richness of our coffees and, therefore, essential to our brand. Because our roasting methods cannot be patented, we would be unable to prevent competitors from copying these methods if such methods became known. In addition, competitors may be able to develop roasting or blending methods that are more advanced than our production methods, which may also harm our competitive position.Increased competition in coffee or other beverage channels may have an adverse impact on sales of our products. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, or if we are not effective in setting proper pricing, then our competitive position may be weakened, we could fail to retain our existing customer base and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected.We may be unable to anticipate changes in customer preferences or successfully develop new products; also, if we do not effectively manage the introduction of new products, our results may be adversely impacted.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to innovate and develop new brands and products both in response to and in anticipation of changing consumer preferences and demographics, and customer demands may require us to make internal investments to achieve or sustain competitive advantages and meet customer expectations. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences, whether resulting from changing consumer demographics or otherwise, demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected.
Further, the success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and demographics, the technical capability of our product development staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with governmental regulations, and the success of our management and sales team in introducing and marketing new products.7The launch and ongoing success of new brands and products is inherently uncertain, especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. Further, we may incur significant research, development and marketing expenditures in connection with our efforts to develop and launch new products, which we may be unable to recoup if such new products and brands do not gain widespread market acceptance. In addition, the unsuccessful launch or fleeting popularity of our product innovations, among other things, may affect consumer perception of existing brands or products and our reputation, which may result in inventory write-offs and other associated costs.We could also be adversely affected if we are not successful in developing new brands or products in response to new brand or product introductions by our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, making them better positioned to pursue new investment opportunities.A failure to sufficiently innovate or maintain adequate and effective marketing or advertising could also inhibit our ability to maintain our brand relevance and drive product sales. If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media, or marketing expenses increase, if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.Increases in the cost of green coffee could reduce our gross margin and profit and may increase volatility in our results.Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Our ability to acquire a consistent supply of green coffee at prices sufficient to meet our needs, similar to any agricultural commodity, may be impacted by, among other things, climate change, weather, natural disasters, real or perceived supply shortages, crop disease (such as coffee rust) and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, an increase in green coffee purchased and sold on a negotiated basis rather than directly on commodity markets in response to higher production costs relative to “C” market prices, speculative trading in coffee commodities, political and economic conditions or uncertainty, labor actions and shortages, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, armed conflict in coffee producing nations, acts of terrorism, global health pandemics or other disease outbreaks, government actions and trade barriers or tariffs, and the actions of producer organizations that have historically attempted to influence green coffee prices through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Additionally, specialty green coffees tend to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” market price which premium, depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase, may be significant. We purchase over-the-counter coffee-related derivative instruments to enable us to lock in the price of green coffee commodity purchases on our behalf or at the direction of our customers under commodity-based pricing arrangements. Although we account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges, the portion of open hedging contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges are marked to period-end market price and unrealized gains or losses based on whether the period-end market price was higher or lower than the price we locked-in are recognized in our financial results at the end of each reporting period. Depending on contractual restrictions, we may be unable to pass these costs to our customers by increasing the price of products. If we are unable to increase prices sufficiently to offset increased input costs, or if our sales volume decreases significantly as a result of price increases, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Recently, there has been increased volatility in the “C” market price, with prices at times increasing to five-year highs. The uncertainty of several factors, including the impact of weather patterns in coffee producing regions, global supply chain constraints and shipping shortages, and speculative trading, has caused greater uncertainty in the markets. Specifically, severe frosts and drought in Brazil currently threaten to negatively impact crop yields for multiple harvests, which could reduce supply and increase cost. Although we hedge the "C" market price volatility for a portion of our green coffee volumes by using derivative instruments, our hedging strategy and use of these instruments does not completely mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. As a result, increases in the cost of green coffee could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. Our accounts receivable represents a significant portion of our current assets increasing our exposure to credit losses and counter-party risk which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our debtors. In addition, certain of our debtors use third-party distributors or do business through a network of affiliate entities which can make collection efforts more challenging and, at times, collections may be economically unfeasible. Any increase in our exposure to losses from bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address such could have a material adverse effect our business and operations.Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on 8global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the regions from which we procure coffee, we could be subject to decreased availability and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Water is used throughout the production of coffee from growing and pulping at the farm, cooling the beans after roasting in production and brewing products for consumption. Scarcity of appropriate and sufficient water sources in our supply chain could limit supply and increase our costs. Loss of readily available access to water could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Concerns over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, foreign and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy and resource efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our manufacturing and distribution costs. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the supply chain and distribution costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change or concerns over climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increased severe weather conditions may increase commodity costs, damage our facilities and disrupt our production capabilities and supply chain.There is a concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have caused and may continue to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Severe weather conditions are dramatically affecting coffee growing countries. The wet and dry seasons are becoming unpredictable in timing and duration, causing improper development of the coffee cherries. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, which are important ingredients for our products. Our customers have experienced storm-related damages and we have experienced disruptions to our operations in the recent past related to both winter storms as well as heavy rainfall and flooding. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could damage our and our customers' facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Investment in acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, not result in the anticipated benefits and present risks not originally contemplated.We have invested, and in the future may invest, in acquisitions which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. The success of any such acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, and to achieve revenue and cost synergies. Additionally, any such acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be identified or that we will be able to consummate any such acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all, or that the synergies from any such acquisitions will be achieved. If any such acquisitions are not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may explore sales of our assets, and such divestitures may introduce significant risks and uncertainties.We may engage in divestitures in the future. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. These include, among others, the inability to find buyers or complete transactions on favorable terms, disruption to our business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns. Significant time and expenses have been and could in the future be incurred to divest the assets described above, which may adversely affect operations as dispositions have required and may in the future require our continued financial involvement, such as through transition service agreements, guarantees, and indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations and liabilities.Our operating results may have significant fluctuations from period to period which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including variations in our operating performance or the performance of our competitors, changes in accounting principles, fluctuations in the price and supply of green coffee, fluctuations in the selling prices of our products, the success of our hedging strategy, research reports and changes in financial estimates by analysts about us, or competitors or our industry, our inability or the inability of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance, strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions and divestitures, capital investments or changes in business strategy, the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, adverse outcomes of litigation, changes in or uncertainty about economic conditions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, 9conditions or trends in our industry, geographies, or customers, activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders, speculation by the investment community regarding our business, actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors, terrorist acts, natural disasters, including due to the effects of climate change, perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives, competition, changes in consumer preferences and market trends, seasonality, our ability to retain and attract customers, our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margin, and other factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section. Fluctuations in our operating results due to these factors or for any other reason could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We may be subject to securities litigation, class action and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and could divert management attention away from other business concerns.The market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition.We face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations, which could impact our margins and profitability.In addition to green coffee, we are exposed to cost fluctuations in other commodities under supply arrangements, including raw materials, tea, spices, and packaging materials such as carton board, corrugate and plastic. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. We purchase certain ingredients, finished goods and packaging materials under cost-plus supply arrangements whereby our costs may increase based on an increase in the underlying commodity price or changes in production costs. The cost of these commodities, raw materials and fuel depend on various factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and hurricanes) and changing global climate patterns. The changes in the prices we pay may take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis depending on the product and supplier. Unlike green coffee, we do not purchase any derivative instruments to hedge cost fluctuations in these other commodities. As a result, to the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases, our margins and profitability will decrease.Our efforts to secure an adequate supply of quality coffees and other raw materials may be unsuccessful and impact our ability to supply our customers or expose us to commodity price risk.Maintaining a reliable supply of green coffee is essential to keeping inventory levels low while securing sufficient stock to meet customer needs. We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers. If any of these supply relationships deteriorate or we are unable to renegotiate contracts with suppliers (with similar or more favorable terms) or find alternative sources for supply, we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high-quality coffee beans and other raw materials at prices acceptable to us or at all which could negatively affect our results of operations. Further, non-performance by suppliers could expose us to supply risk under coffee purchase commitments for delivery in the future. In addition, the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions, including Africa, Indonesia, and Central and South America, can be unstable, and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If green coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to use alternative coffee beans or discontinue certain blends, which could adversely impact our sales.
Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss at our roasting plant or suppliers, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. Product shortages could result in disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, a deterioration of our relationship with our customers, decreased revenues or an inability to expand our business.
Interruption or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network or labor force, including a disruption in operations at any of our production and distribution facilities, could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products and could adversely affect our business and sales.Our sales and distribution network requires a large investment to maintain and operate, and we rely on a limited number of production and distribution facilities. We also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. Certain products are 10also distributed by third parties or direct shipped via common carrier. Many of these costs are beyond our control, and many are fixed rather than variable.There are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or with others who provide warehousing, co-packing, transportation (lines, truck drivers, 3PL service providers) or cargo handling (longshoremen), both domestic and foreign, of our raw materials or other products. We have union contracts relating to a portion of our workforce. Although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future or that we will not be subject to future union organizing activity. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, gasoline, diesel and oil, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources that may be caused by increased demand, inflation or by events such as climate change, natural disasters, power outages, cyberattacks or the like, could lead to higher electricity, transportation and other commodity costs, including the pass-through of such costs under our agreements with 3PL service providers and other suppliers, that could negatively impact our profitability, financial condition or results of operations.A disruption in operations at any of these facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain or increase in prices relating to service by our 3PL service providers, common carriers or distributors, service technicians or vendor-managed inventory arrangements, or otherwise, whether as a result of casualty, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, labor shortages, shipping costs, trade restrictions, contractual disputes, weather, environmental incident, interruptions in port operations or highway arteries, increased downtime due to certain aging production infrastructure, pandemic, strikes, work stoppages, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors and transportation providers, or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and impact our financial condition or results of operations. If our vendors fail to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws, these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.We rely on co-packers to provide our supply of tea, spice, culinary and other products. Any failure by co-packers to fulfill their obligations or any termination or renegotiation of our co-pack agreements could adversely affect our results of operations.We have a number of supply agreements with co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods, including tea, spice and culinary products. For some of our products we primarily rely upon a single co-packer as our sole-source for the product. The failure for any reason of any such sole-source or other co-packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us, including the failure by our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations, or the termination or renegotiation of any such co-pack agreement could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods, cause damage to our reputation and brands, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our co-packers are subject to risk, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, pandemics, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods, or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing a new co-pack arrangement with another provider. A new co-pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing co-pack arrangements, or at all.Customer quality control problems or food safety issues may adversely affect our brands thereby negatively impacting our sales or leading to potential product recalls or product liability claims.Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks. Our success depends on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh products, we have no control over our products once they are purchased by our customers. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages. We have no ability to ensure that our customers use a clean water supply to prepare these beverages.
Instances or reports of food safety issues involving our products, whether or not accurate, such as unclean water supply, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or other food or beverage safety issues, including due to the failure of our third-party co-packers to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications, could damage the value of our brands, negatively impact sales of our products, and potentially lead to product recalls, production interruptions, product liability claims, litigation or damages. A significant product liability claim against us, whether or not successful, or a widespread product recall may reduce our sales and harm our business.Consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety and health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased 11consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of such products, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable net income may be subject to certain limitations.At June 30, 2025, we had approximately $124.2 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the tax year ending June 30, 2030 and $157.5 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in the tax year ending June 30, 2025. Net operating losses of $74.0 million in federal and $8.8 million of state are indefinite lived and will not expire. If an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use net operating losses ("NOLs") to offset taxable income would be subject to certain limitations. Generally, an ownership change occurs under Section 382 of the Code if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable net income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate. If an ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable net income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code and limit our ability to use NOLs to offset taxable income. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire, decrease in value or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As a result, we may be unable to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, even if we generate a sufficient level of taxable net income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry forward periods.Future impairment charges could adversely affect our operating results.Acquisitions are based on certain target analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining the acquisition price. After consummation of an acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. We perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate possible existence of impairment. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions, loss of or significant decline in sales to customers included in valuation of the intangible asset, changes in our imputed cost of capital, and declines in our market capitalization, among other things, could result in impairment of our intangible assets and adversely affect our operating results. There were no intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.There is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new laws, regulations and requirements that could cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with developing, manufacturing and distributing our products. We could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands, our customers refuse to buy our products, or investors choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not meet their environmental, social and governance, or ESG, and sustainability expectations.Further, the evolving legal and regulatory landscape and increased stakeholder focus on ESG and related matters has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. This rapidly changing environment may result in increased general and administrative expenses. There has also been a recent increase in litigation and investor activism surrounding ESG practices and related disclosures. For example, there has been recent focus by regulators, investors and other stakeholders on greenwashing and sustainability-related claims. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to allegations or claims with respect to ESG issues or our sustainability goals and objectives.12From time to time, we announce certain initiatives regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, sustainability in our supply chain, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion and diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions and standards that could change over time. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We rely on independent certifications for a number of our productsWe rely on independent third-party certifications, such as certifications of our products as “organic,” “Non-GMO” or “kosher,” to differentiate our products from others. We must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified organic. For example, we can lose our “organic” certification if a manufacturing plant becomes contaminated with non-organic materials, or if it is not properly cleaned after a production run. In addition, all raw materials must be certified organic. Similarly, we can lose our “kosher” certification if a manufacturing plant and raw materials do not meet the requirements of the appropriate kosher supervision organization. The loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as an organic and natural products company, which could harm our business.Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal MattersGovernment regulations affecting the conduct of our business could increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations including those relating to food safety, ingredients, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and distribution of our products, import of raw materials, as well as environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and sustainability, and those relating to privacy, worker health and workplace safety. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof are subject to change as a result of political, economic or social events. In addition, our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states. Any new laws and regulations or changes in government policy, existing laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof could require us to change certain of our operational processes and procedures, or implement new ones, and may increase our operating and compliance costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, modifications to international trade policy, or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes or procedures (or force us to implement new processes or procedures). In addition, compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products. If we or our business partners fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adversely affect our reputation and brand image. In addition, claims or liabilities of this sort may not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others.We could face significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.We participate in one multiemployer defined benefit pension plan and nine multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans for certain union employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these plans could increase due to a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and we are not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. In the event we withdraw from participation in one or more of these plans, we could be required to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. The amount of any potential withdrawal liability could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.Litigation pending against us could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.We are currently party to various legal and other proceedings, and additional claims may arise in the future. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. Regardless of 13the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, operationally disruptive and distracting to management, and could negatively affect our brand name and image and subject us to statutory penalties and costs of enforcement. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation or the resolution of any other claims against us. An adverse outcome of any litigation or other claim could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We are partially self-insured and our current coverage and reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liability of certain risks up to varying deductible amounts. The premiums associated with our insurance continue to increase. General liability, fire, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, life, employee medical, dental and vision, and automobile risks present significant potential liabilities. While we accrue for these potential liabilities based on historical claims experience, future claims may exceed claims we have incurred in the past. Should a different number of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the cost of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and the accruals may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our reserves or available insurance limits could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We maintain finished goods product coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot assure you that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.
Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall or the damage to our reputation resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.Risks Related to our Capital Structure and Ownership of Our Common StockAn increase in our debt leverage could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.We maintain a senior secured credit facility composed of a revolver credit facility (the "Revolver Credit Facility" or the "Credit Facility") and a term credit facility agreement (the “Term Credit Facility”) (See discussion under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition below for additional details). The Credit Facility was subsequently amended on December 20, 2021, August 8, 2022, August 31, 2022, June 30, 2023 and December 4, 2023. At June 30, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings of $14.3 million and utilized $4.7 million of the letters of credit sublimit under the Credit Facility, and had $32.6 million of availability under our Credit Facility. We may incur significant indebtedness in the future, including through additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, through the issuance of debt securities, or otherwise.Our present indebtedness and any future borrowings could have adverse consequences, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness;•reducing the cash flow available or limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, to pay dividends, to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to pursue our business strategies;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.To the extent we become more leveraged, we face an increased likelihood that one or more of the risks described above would materialize.
The Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay 14dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. If we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants under the Credit Facility or any other agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Facility or any such other agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If our liquidity materially declines, we may experience springing covenants and an increase in our cost of borrowing. Furthermore, our lenders under the Credit Facility could foreclose on their security interests in our assets. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.Our liquidity has been adversely affected as a result of our operating performance in recent periods and may be further materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital and credit markets and limitations under our financing arrangements.We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash, our credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of assets. In recent periods, significant acquisition costs, large capital investments along with the underperformance of our business has resulted in a decrease in funds from operating activities, which has weakened our liquidity position. Should our operating performance deteriorate further, we will have less cash inflows from operations available to meet our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. Deterioration of our operating performance may also result in a reduction in our working capital, which could negatively impact our available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. In addition, if such deterioration were to lead to the closure of leased facilities, we would need to fund the costs of terminating those leases. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to satisfy these financial obligations, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•sell assets; and/or•reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, and could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our indebtedness would depend upon, among other things, our financial condition at the time, and the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy. Furthermore, any refinancing of our existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, if our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the credit facility, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies. In addition, covenants in our debt agreements could restrict or delay our ability to respond to business opportunities, or in the event of a failure to comply with such covenants, could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.We may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations.We may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business, the number, complexity and characteristics of additional products or future manufacturing processes we require to serve new or existing markets, any material or significant product recalls, any failure or disruption with our manufacturing and co-packing partners as well as our third party logistics providers, the expansion into new markets, any changes in our regulatory or legislative landscape, particularly with respect to 15product safety, advertising, product labeling and data privacy, the costs associated with being a public company and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our operating plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business, our markets and the broader economy and it is possible that our business could become more capital intensive. Although we believe that our Credit Facility, together with our cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the near term, arrangements for additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, when needed. Additionally, any such arrangements may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders, and may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements.Inflationary pressures may adversely affect us by increasing costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of raw materials, labor, and other costs required to operate and grow our business. Many of the markets in which we sell our products are experiencing high and rising levels of inflation, which may depress consumer demand for our products and reduce our profitability if we are unable to raise prices enough to keep up with increases in our costs. Inflationary pressures have resulted in increases in the cost of certain raw materials, and other supplies necessary for the production of our products, and such increases may continue to impact us in the future and expose us to risks associated with significant levels of cost inflation. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Anti-takeover provisions or stockholder dilution could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by stockholders. We currently have 500,000 authorized shares of preferred stock undesignated as to series. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.Further, certain provisions of our organizational documents have provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent, and provisions limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, our organizational documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits Delaware corporations from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management.Volatility in the equity markets or interest rate fluctuations could substantially increase our pension funding requirements and negatively impact our financial position.As of June 30, 2025, the projected benefit obligation under our employer defined benefit pension plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, or the funded status of the plan, significantly affects the net periodic benefit cost and ongoing funding requirements of the plan. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, mix of plan asset investments, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, increase our future funding requirements and require payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In addition, facility closings may trigger cash payments or previously unrecognized obligations under our defined benefit pension plan, and the cost of such liabilities may be significant or may compromise our ability to close facilities or otherwise conduct cost reduction initiatives on time and within budget. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.We have been and may continue to be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. Responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and can disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and employees. If activist stockholder activities continue, our business could be adversely affected. 16For example, we have been and may continue to be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.If securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our stock, publish negative research or reports or do not publish reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock or our competitors’ stock, our stock price may likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.We rely on information technology and software in our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could affect our ability to effectively operate our business.Our ability to effectively manage our business, maintain information accuracy and efficiency, comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, capacity and integrity of information technology systems, software and networks. We are also dependent on enterprise resource planning software for some of our information technology systems and support. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and continuously for any reason could result in delays in processing replenishment orders from our branch warehouses, an inability to record input costs or product sales accurately or at all, an impaired understanding of our operations and results, an increase in operating expenses, reduced operational efficiency, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security, however our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes. While we have implemented training and information security policies for our team members and bolstered cybersecurity experience on our board, these measures may be insufficient to prevent against the constantly evolving threats. These threats increase the difficulty of timely detection and successful defense. As a result, security, backup, disaster recovery, administrative and technical controls, and incident response measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems. Failure to effectively allocate and manage our resources to build, sustain, protect and upgrade our information technology infrastructure could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, reputational damage, litigation, business disruptions, or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any potential problems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. In addition, if our customers or suppliers experience a security breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or negatively affected, which may result in a reduction in customer orders or disruption in our supply chain, which would adversely affect our results of operations.17Failure to prevent the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of personal, financial and other confidential information relating to our customers, suppliers, employees or our Company, could damage our business reputation, negatively affect our results of operations, and expose us to potential liability.The protection of our customer, supplier, employee, and Company data and confidential information is critical. We are subject to new and changing privacy and information security laws and standards that may require significant investments in technology and new operational processes. The use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing personal information from individuals, including our customers, suppliers and employees, and our security measures may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to such information. We rely on third party, cloud based technologies which results in third party access and storage of Company data and confidential information. Employees or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource certain information technology or administrative services may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If we experience a data security breach of any kind or fail to respond appropriately to such incidents, we may experience a loss of or damage to critical data, suffer financial or reputational damage or penalties, or face exposure to negative publicity, government investigations and proceedings, private consumer or securities litigation, liability or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers and suppliers may be affected, which could result in our customers and suppliers ceasing to do business with us which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part upon our ability to further build brand recognition, including for our proprietary products, using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos. We have registered or applied to register a number of our trademarks. We cannot assure investors that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. If our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes upon our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be affected in a materially adverse manner. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our services, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could harm our future prospects.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNot applicable. Item 1C.CybersecurityOverviewWe understand the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data. In order to protect against increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats, we have developed, implemented and maintained policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats, including robust protocols for the assessment of information concerning material cybersecurity incidents and the disclosure of such information to investors. These risks are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our overall risk management strategy. As discussed in more detail below, we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard our information systems, monitor these systems, protect the confidentiality and integrity of our data, train and raise awareness of cybersecurity threats amongst employees, detect intrusions into our systems, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Despite these efforts, no system is impenetrable, and we cannot provide assurances that we will timely identify or prevent every cybersecurity attack or incident.18Risk Management and StrategyWe have established processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and have integrated these cybersecurity processes into our overall risk management system. Specifically, we have adopted a cybersecurity framework which, where appropriate, aligns with the NIST's Cybersecurity Framework. Further, our systems, where appropriate, are PCI compliant under current standards.We regularly review our Incident Response Plans to ensure readiness if and when an incident does occur. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, if a system does become non-operational, we maintain disaster recovery capabilities to return to normal operation in a timely manner.Our cybersecurity processes to assess and identify cybersecurity risks include periodic risk assessments, deployment of security monitoring tools for continuous monitoring of our information systems, periodic testing for vulnerabilities in our systems, periodic testing of employees’ cybersecurity awareness, and the dispatch of incident-specific cybersecurity alerts, among other procedures.Our Information Security team evaluates cybersecurity risks and works to design and ensure implementation of appropriate controls and safeguards in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. Management periodically reviews cybersecurity risks as part of the overall risks to the company as part of the enterprise risk management program. This review helps in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the alignment of cybersecurity efforts with the overall risk management framework.We engage various third parties to assess, test, or assist with the implementation of our risk management strategies, policies, and procedures to enhance our detection and management of cybersecurity risks, including but not limited to: consultants who assist with assessing risks, support our PCI compliance assessments, assess our systems alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and test and/or scan for vulnerabilities.We rely on software, hardware, and network systems, including cloud-based technology, which are either developed by us or licensed from or maintained by third parties to maintain operations.Cybersecurity GovernanceManagementThe Company’s Director of Infrastructure & Security leads its cybersecurity program and reports to the Company’s Vice President of Information Technology. The Director of Infrastructure & Security is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk and protection and defense of the Company's networks and systems. The Director of Infrastructure & Security manages a team of cybersecurity professionals with broad experience and expertise, including in incident response, forensics, threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and mitigation. The Company's cybersecurity team has processes in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents. These include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees, mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network and endpoint activity, integrated threat intelligence and containment and incident response tools. The cybersecurity team also leverages multiple third-party security programs for full-time monitoring of security stacks and on-demand support to act as force multipliers in the event of severe or critical security events.Both the Company’s Director of Infrastructure & Security and Vice President of Information Technology have extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills, with each possessing over 20 years of cybersecurity and related IT security experience. The Director of Infrastructure & Security and the Vice President of Information Technology each remain informed of and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents and risks, including through their regular review of reports prepared by the Company’s Information Security team and the measures implemented by the Company to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks and related threats.Board of DirectorsOur Board of Directors (the "Board") oversees our Enterprise Risk Management program, and cybersecurity risks are monitored as a part of the broader program. Our Board has primary responsibility to oversee risks from cybersecurity threats and has designated a specific director, who possesses significant experience in information technology as a special liaison (the “Technology Liaison”) between management and the Board of Directors. The Board as a whole, or through the Technology Liaison, regularly reviews the measures implemented by the Company to identify and mitigate data protection and cybersecurity risks. Our Technology Liaison receives quarterly updates from the Director of Infrastructure and Security and the Vice President of Information Technology relating to significant risks, cyber incidents, key performance indicators measuring the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity risk program and other relevant matters. The Technology Liaison regularly briefs the Board on these updates, and the Board also receives periodic briefings on cybersecurity risk as part of the Company’s broader Enterprise Risk Management program. These risks, including current and emerging risks, are regularly evaluated by the Technology Liaison and the Board. In addition to the regular updates to the Technology Liaison, we have protocols by which 19certain cybersecurity incidents and threats are escalated within the Company and, where appropriate, reported in a timely manner to the Board and Technology Liaison.Item 2.PropertiesOur production and distribution facilities as of June 30, 2025 are as follows:LocationApproximate Area(Square Feet)PurposeStatusFort Worth, TX25,000Corporate headquarters and product development labLeasedPortland, OR220,000Manufacturing and distribution, product development labLeasedOklahoma City, OK81,105Equipment repair centerLeasedRialto, CA156,586Distribution and warehouseLeasedNorthlake, IL89,837Distribution and warehouseLeasedMoonachie, NJ41,404Distribution and warehouseLeasedAs of June 30, 2025, we stage our products in over 90 storage locations throughout the contiguous United States. These branch warehouses and our distribution centers, taken together, represent a vital part of our business, but no individual branch warehouse is material to the business as a whole. Our stand-alone branch warehouses vary in size from approximately 1,000 to 25,000 square feet.Approximately 86% of our facilities are leased with a variety of expiration dates within the range of 2025 through 2032. We calculate our utilization for all of our coffee roasting facilities on an aggregate basis based on the number of product pounds manufactured during the actual number of production shifts worked during an average week, compared to the number of product pounds that could be manufactured based on the maximum number of production shifts that could be operated during the week (assuming three shifts per day, five days per week), in each case, based on our current product mix. Utilization rates for our coffee roasting facilities were approximately 43% and 67% during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. We believe that our existing facilities provide adequate capacity for our current operations.Item 3.Legal ProceedingsFor information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable. PART IIItem 5.Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationThe principal market on which our common stock is listed for trading is the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FARM.” HoldersAs of September 2, 2025, there were approximately 176 shareholders of record of common stock. This does not include persons whose common stock is in nominee or “street name” accounts through brokers.DividendsWe have not recently declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Purchases of Equity SecuritiesNeither we, nor any affiliated purchaser, purchased any of our equity securities during the quarter ended June 30, 2025.Sale of Unregistered SecuritiesWe did not sell unregistered securities during fiscal 2025.Item 6.Reserved20Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. The results of operations for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. This discussion, which presents our results for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes and Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on September 12, 2024, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2024, which provides additional information on our results for fiscal 2024.Our BusinessWe are a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea and other allied products manufactured under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. Our principal office is located in Fort Worth, Texas. We operate in one business segment.We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurants, department and convenience store retailers, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also focus on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible.Our product categories consist of a robust line of roast and ground coffee, including organic, Direct Trade, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, Fair Trade Certified™® and other sustainably-produced offerings; frozen liquid coffee; flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas; including organic and Rainforest Alliance Certified™; culinary products including premium spices, pancake and biscuit mixes, gravy and sauce mixes, soup bases, dressings, syrups and sauces, and coffee-related products such as coffee filters, cups, sugar and creamers; and other beverages including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and other blender-based beverages and concentrated and ready-to-drink cold brew and iced coffee. We offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service. We operate a production and distribution facility in Portland, Oregon. We distribute our products from our Portland, Oregon production facility, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Moonachie, New Jersey; and Rialto, California. Our products reach our customers primarily through our nationwide DSD network of over 200 delivery routes and over 90 storage locations as of June 30, 2025. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. Summary Overview of Fiscal 2025 ResultsNet sales in fiscal 2025 increased $1.2 million, or 0.3%, to $342.3 million from $341.1 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher pricing compared to prior periods, partially offset by a decline in sales volume. During fiscal 2025, we experienced higher gross margins compared to fiscal 2024. Overall, gross margins increased by 4.2% to 43.5% in fiscal
2025 from 39.3% in fiscal 2024. The improvement in gross margins was a result of price increases implemented across our network.Operating expenses increased by $14.2 million in fiscal 2025 over the prior year period due to a $20.2 million decrease in gain on sale of assets from the sale of branch properties and other assets compared to prior year offset by a $3.6 million decrease in selling expenses and a $2.4 million decrease in general and administrative expenses . The decrease in selling expenses during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to decreased spend on facility and healthcare benefits, partially offset by an increase in rent related expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in consulting related costs and rent. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 were $9.6 million as compared to $13.8 million in fiscal 2024, a decrease of $4.3 million. This was driven by a decrease in coffee brewing equipment spend.As of June 30, 2025, the outstanding debt on our Revolver Credit Facility was $14.3 million, a decrease of $9.0 million since June 30, 2024. Our cash increased by $1.0 million to $7.0 million as of June 30, 2025, compared to $6.0 million as of June 30, 2024. 21Financial Data Highlights (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) For The Years Ended June 30,2025 vs 202420252024Favorable (Unfavorable) Change% ChangeIncome Statement Data:Net sales$342,281 $341,094 $1,187 0.3 %Gross margin43.5 %39.3 %4.2 %10.7 %Operating expenses as a % of sales43.9 %39.9 %(4.0)%(10.0)%Net loss$(14,516)$(3,875)$(10,641)NMNet loss available to common stockholders per common share—basic and diluted$(0.68)$(0.19)$(0.49)NMOperating Data:Coffee pounds19,984 22,169 (2,185)(9.9)%EBITDA(1)$(381)$10,718 $(11,099)(103.6)%EBITDA Margin(1)(0.1)%3.1 %(3.2)%NMAdjusted EBITDA(1)$14,832 $558 $14,274 NMAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)4.3 %0.2 %4.1 %NMPercentage of Total Net Sales By Product CategoryCoffee (Roasted)48.1 %46.4 %1.7 %3.7 %Tea & Other Beverages (2)27.0 %26.4 %0.6 %2.3 %Culinary17.6 %19.3 %(1.7)%(8.8)%Spices6.0 %6.4 %(0.4)%(6.3)%Delivery Surcharge1.3 %1.5 %(0.2)%NMNet sales100.0 %100.0 %Other data:Total capital expenditures9,591 13,843 4,252 30.7 %Depreciation & amortization expense11,448 11,588 140 1.2 %________________NM - Not Meaningful(1) EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Some of these factors include:•Investment in Manufacturing Facility. We are focused on leveraging our Portland, Oregon facility to produce the highest quality coffee in response to the market shift to premium and specialty coffee and create sustainable long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our facility to ensure reliable production while focusing on overall production costs. •Supply Chain Efficiencies and Competition. In order to compete effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities, we must retain and continue to grow our customer base, evaluate and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and streamline our supply chain. We continue to look for ways to deploy our personnel, systems, assets and infrastructure to create or enhance stockholder value. Areas of focus include distribution network optimization, methods of procurement, logistics, inventory management, supporting technology, and real estate assets. The ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce, as well as mitigate global supply chain challenges, will affect our future growth and profitability. •Demographic and Channel Trends. Our success is dependent upon our ability to develop new products in response to demographic and other trends to better compete in areas such as premium coffee and tea, including expansion of our product portfolio by investing resources in what we believe to be key growth categories and different formats. •Fluctuations in Green Coffee Prices. Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and regulatory changes such as tariffs. The price and availability of green coffee directly impacts our results of operations. For additional details, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.•Coffee Sourcing and Hedging Strategy. We are exposed to market risk of losses due to changes in coffee commodity prices. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through strategic vendor pricing and derivative instruments when 22appropriate. The impact of derivative instruments is further explained in Note 4, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K.•Coffee Brewing Equipment Service & Restoration ("Revive"). With Revive, we offer our customers a comprehensive equipment program and 24/7 nationwide equipment service which we believe differentiates us in the marketplace. We offer a full spectrum of equipment needs, which includes brewing equipment installation, water filtration systems, equipment training, and maintenance services to ensure we are able to meet our customer’s demands.  Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.  For the Years Ended June 30,2025 vs 202420252024Favorable (Unfavorable)Change% ChangeNet sales$342,281 $341,094 $1,187 0.3 %Cost of goods sold193,371 207,201 13,830 6.7 %Gross profit148,910 133,893 15,017 11.2 %Selling expenses107,749 111,371 3,622 3.3 %General and administrative expenses39,275 41,649 2,374 5.7 %Net losses (gains) on disposal of assets3,347 (16,877)(20,224)NMOperating expenses150,371 136,143 (14,228)(10.5)%Loss from operations(1,461)(2,250)789 35.1 %Other (expense) income:Interest expense(7,480)(7,835)355 4.5 %Pension settlement charge(7,726)— (7,726)— %Other, net2,267 6,224 (3,957)NMTotal other expense(12,939)(1,611)(11,328)(703.2)%Loss from operations before taxes(14,400)(3,861)(10,539)(273.0)%Income tax expense116 14 (102)(728.6)%Net loss$(14,516)$(3,875)$(10,641)(274.6)%_____________
NM - Not MeaningfulFiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024Net SalesNet sales in fiscal 2025 increased $1.2 million, or 0.3%, to $342.3 million from $341.1 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher pricing compared to prior periods, partially offset by a decline in sales volume. On our sales, average unit price increased due to the increase in pricing. The following table presents the effect of changes in unit sales, unit pricing and product mix for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 (in millions):Units Sold and PricingFor Year Ended June 30, 2025 vs 2024% of Total Mix Change Effect of change in unit sales(47.4)(4.0)%Effect of pricing and product mix changes48.6 4.0 %Total increase in net sales1.2 — %Unit sales decreased 12.3% and average unit price increased by 14.5% in fiscal 2025 as compared to the same prior year period, resulting in a net increase in net sales of 0.3%. Average unit price increased during fiscal 2025 due to a mix of products sold, along with price increases implemented during fiscal 2025. There were no new product category introductions in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024 which had a material impact on our net sales.Gross ProfitGross profit in fiscal 2025 increased $15.0 million, or 11.2%, to $148.9 million from $133.9 million in fiscal 2024. Gross margin increased by 4.2% to 43.5% in fiscal 2025 from 39.3% in fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit in fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by improved pricing.Operating ExpensesIn fiscal 2025, operating expenses increased by $14.3 million, or 10.5%, to $150.4 million, from $136.1 million, in fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to a $3.6 million decrease in selling expenses and a $2.4 million decrease in general and 23administrative expenses. Net loss from disposal of assets was $3.3 million in fiscal 2025 compared to a net gain from disposal of assets of
$16.9 million in fiscal 2024The decrease in selling expenses during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to decreased spend on facility and healthcare benefits, partially offset by an increase in rent related expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in consulting related costs and rent.
Total Other Income (Expense)
Total other income (expense) in fiscal 2025 was $12.9 million of expense compared to $1.6 million of expense in fiscal 2024. The change in total other income (expense) in fiscal 2025 was primarily a result of a charges related to pension settlement and losses from coffee-related derivative instruments in fiscal 2025. Interest expense in fiscal 2025 decreased $0.4 million to $7.5 million from $7.8 million in the prior year period. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2025 was principally due to lower supplier interest expense.In fiscal 2025, Other, net decreased by $3.9 million to a $2.3 million gain compared to a $6.2 million gain in fiscal 2024. The decrease in Other, net, was primarily a result of mark-to-market net gains on coffee-related derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges during fiscal 2024.Income TaxesIn fiscal 2025, we recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million as compared to income tax expense of $14.0 thousand in fiscal 2024. The income tax expense primarily relates to the Hourly Employees' Plan and Death Benefit settlement and state income tax.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to net loss determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating performance:“EBITDA” is defined as net loss operations excluding the impact of:•income tax expense (benefit);•interest expense; and•depreciation and amortization expense.“EBITDA Margin” is defined as EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net loss excluding the impact of:•income tax expense (benefit);•interest expense;•depreciation and amortization expense;•401(k) and share-based compensation expense;•net gains from sales of assets;•severance costs;•pension settlement charge;•strategic initiatives; and•loss related to sale of business.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.For purposes of calculating EBITDA and EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, we have excluded the impact of interest expense resulting from non-cash pretax pension and postretirement benefits. For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, we are also excluding the impact of severance and the loss related to sale of business as these items are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets. We believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and 24book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Availability under the revolver is calculated as the lesser of (a) $75.0 million or (b) the amount equal to the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable (less a dilution reserve), plus (ii) the lesser of: (a) 80% of eligible raw material inventory, eligible in-transit inventory and eligible finished goods inventory (collectively, “Eligible Inventory”), and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of Eligible Inventory, minus (c) applicable reserve. The term loan under the Term Credit Facility was fully paid down on June 30, 2023. The Credit Facility contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of 25the Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments.
As of and through June 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides us with increased flexibility to proactively manage our liquidity and working capital, while maintaining compliance with our debt financial covenants, and preserving financial liquidity to mitigate the impact of the uncertain business environment and continue to execute on key strategic initiatives.At June 30, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings of $14.3 million and utilized $4.7 million of the letters of credit sublimit under the Credit Facility, and had $32.6 million of availability under our Credit Facility. LiquidityWe generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility.
In light of our financial position, operating performance and current economic conditions, including the state of the global capital markets, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to raise capital by issuing securities. We believe that the Credit Facility, to the extent available, in addition to our cash flows from operations, collectively, will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months.At June 30, 2025, we had $6.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under our broker and counterparty agreements and may adversely affect our liquidity. An economic downturn may also cause substantial changes in consumer behavior and demand for our products, adversely affecting results of operations and our financial position, some of which we may not be able to predict with certainty.Cash FlowsThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below: For the Years Ended June 30,20252024Consolidated Statements of cash flows data (in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$16,097 (14,147)Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities(5,902)14,723 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(9,226)10 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$969 $586 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 increased $30.2 million as compared to fiscal 2024. The change was driven by a decrease in inventory and increased margin percentage in fiscal 2025.
Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 was $5.9 million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $14.7 million during fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, proceeds from sale of assets was $4.5 million offset by capital expenditures of $9.6 million. In fiscal 2024, proceeds from sale of assets was $29.8 million offset by capital expenditures of $13.8 million.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2025 was $9.2 million as compared to $10.0 thousand of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2024. The Revolver Credit Facility decreased to $14.3 million as of June 30, 2024 with $9.0 million of net paydowns on the Revolver Credit Facility in fiscal 2025.Capital ExpendituresFor fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 our capital expenditures paid were $9.6 million and $13.8 million, respectively. In fiscal 2026, we anticipate capital expenditures will be between $9.0 million and $11.0 million. We expect to finance these expenditures through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolver Credit Facility.Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.4 million and $11.6 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.Settlement AgreementOn June 30, 2023, the Company completed its previously announced sale of certain assets related to its direct ship and private label business, including its production facility and corporate office building in Northlake, Texas (the “Sale”), pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2023, by and between the Company and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (the “Buyer”), as amended by that certain Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2023. The Company and 26the Buyer executed a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) related to the Asset Purchase Agreement, effective March 27, 2025, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Buyer an amount equal to $0.8 million.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a summary of recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards and their related effects or anticipated effects on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2025 or June 30, 2024.Critical Accounting EstimatesWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:Fair value of coffee-related derivative instrumentsWe are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee. In general, increases in the price of green coffee could cause our cost of goods sold to increase and, if not offset by product price increases, could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments.We utilize derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changing green coffee commodity prices. We purchase over-the-counter coffee derivative instruments to enable us to lock in the price of green coffee commodity purchases. These derivative instruments may be entered into at the direction of the customer under commodity-based pricing arrangements to effectively lock in the purchase price of green coffee under such customer arrangements, in certain cases up to 18 months or longer in the future. Notwithstanding this customer direction, pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” we are considered the owner of these derivative instruments and, therefore, we are required to account for them as such. In the event the customer fails to purchase the products associated with the underlying derivative instruments for which the price has been locked-in on behalf of the customer, we expect that such derivative instruments will be assigned to, and assumed by, the customer in accordance with contractual terms or, in the absence of such terms, in accordance with standard industry custom and practice. In the event the customer fails to assume such derivative instruments, we will remain obligated on the derivative instruments at settlement. We generally settle derivative instruments to coincide with the receipt of the purchased green coffee or apply the derivative instruments to purchase orders effectively fixing the cost of in-bound green coffee purchases. We do not purchase any derivative instruments to hedge cost fluctuations of any commodities other than green coffee.The fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes. We account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges in order to minimize the volatility created in our quarterly results from utilizing these derivative contracts and to improve comparability between reporting periods. The change in fair value of the derivative is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheet and subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold in the period or periods when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Single Employer Pension PlanThe estimation of our single employer Farmer Bros. pension plan requires that we make use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions.The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:•Discount rates. We utilize a yield curve analysis to determine the discount rates for our defined benefit plans’ obligations. The yield curve considers pricing and yield information for high quality bonds with maturities matched to estimated payouts of future pension benefits.27•Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long-term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds, considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the Farmer Bros. pension plan, holding all other assumptions constant:($ in thousands)Effect on 2024 Net Periodic Benefit CostEffect on June 30, 2024 PBO50 basis points decrease in discount rate$(49)$2,656 50 basis points increase in discount rate$43 $(2,438)50 basis points decrease in expected rate of return on assets$213 N/A50 basis points increase in expected rate of return on assets$(213)N/ASee Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K for further discussions of our various pension plans.Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes set forth in the F pages of this Form 10-K.Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone. Item 9A.Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.As of June 30, 2025, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act during our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Co.Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Farmer Bros. Co. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Basis for opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical audit mattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters./s/ GRANT THORNTON LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.Dallas, TexasSeptember 11, 2025F - 2 FARMER BROS. CO.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In thousands, except share and per share data)As of June 30,20252024ASSETSCurrent assets:  Cash and cash equivalents$6,796 $5,830   Restricted cash178 175   Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $650 and $710, respectively24,758 35,147   Inventories49,839 57,230   Short-term derivative assets— 11   Prepaid expenses3,975 4,236   Assets held for sale— 352           Total current assets85,546 102,981 Property, plant and equipment, net27,845 34,002 Intangible assets, net9,033 11,233 Right-of-use operating lease assets38,347 35,241 Other assets461 1,756             Total assets$161,232 $185,213 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYCurrent liabilities:  Accounts payable37,669 48,478   Accrued payroll expenses12,692 10,782   Right-of-use operating lease liabilities -

7FARMER BROS. CO.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1. Introduction and Basis of PresentationDescription of BusinessFarmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company,” or “Farmer Bros.”), is a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea and other allied products. The Company serves a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant, department and convenience store retailers, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. The Company’s product categories consist of roast and ground coffee; frozen liquid coffee flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas and other beverages including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and concentrated and ready-to-drink cold brew and iced coffee; culinary products and spices. The Company was founded in 1912 incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. The Company's principal office and product development lab is located in Fort Worth, Texas. The Company operates in one business segment. The Company operates a production and distribution facility in Portland, Oregon. Distribution takes place out of several distribution centers in Portland, Oregon; Northlake, Illinois; Rialto, California; and Moonachie, New Jersey. The Company’s products reach its customers primarily through the DSD network of over 200 delivery routes and over 90 storage locations as of June 30, 2025. The Company also does direct-ship via common carriers or third-party distributors. The Company operates a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver its products through its DSD network, and relies on third-party logistic (“3PL”) service providers for its long-haul distribution. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” by the Company to its customers at their places of business. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).On June 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of certain assets of the Company related to its direct ship and private label business, including the Company’s production facility and corporate office building in Northlake, Texas, pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of June 6, 2023, by and between the Company and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (the "Buyer"), as amended by that certain Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2023. During Q2 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of $1.2 million related to a working capital adjustment. The Company and the Buyer executed a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) related to the Asset Purchase Agreement, effective Q3 2025, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay Buyer an amount equal to $0.8 million.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis using currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from those estimates.Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Fair values of cash equivalents approximate cost due to the short period of time to maturity. At June 30, 2025, we had $6.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million in restricted cash. The restricted cash is related to a third party service agreement.Allowance for credit lossesA portion of our accounts receivable is not expected to be collected due to non-payment, bankruptcies and deductions. Our accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses requires us to reserve an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable, detailed analysis of high-risk customers’ accounts, historical customer losses and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers to estimate future losses. This evaluation considers the customer demographic, such as F - 8Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)large commercial customers as compared to small businesses or individual customers. We consider our accounts receivable delinquent or past due based on payment terms established with each customer. Accounts receivable are written off when the accounts are determined to be uncollectible.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:•Level 1—Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.•Level 2—Valuation is based upon inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (i.e. interest rate and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, default rates, etc.). Observable inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active and non-active markets. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued with industry standard valuation models that incorporate inputs that are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, or can otherwise be derived from or supported by observable market data in the marketplace. Level 2 inputs may also include insignificant adjustments to market observable inputs.•Level 3—Valuation is based upon one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in establishing a fair value estimate. These unobservable inputs are used to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available and are developed based on the best information available. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.Securities with quotes that are based on actual trades or actionable bids and offers with a sufficient level of activity on or near the measurement date are classified as Level 1. Securities that are priced using quotes derived from implied values, indicative bids and offers, or a limited number of actual trades, or the same information for securities that are similar in many respects to those being valued, are classified as Level 2. If market information is not available for securities being valued, or materially-comparable securities, then those securities are classified as Level 3. In considering market information, management evaluates changes in liquidity, willingness of a broker to execute at the quoted price, the depth and consistency of prices from pricing services, and the existence of observable trades in the market. Derivative InstrumentsThe Company executes various derivative instruments to hedge its commodity price and interest rate risks. These derivative instruments consist primarily of forward, option and swap contracts. The Company reports the fair value of derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets in “Short-term derivative assets,” “Other assets,” “Short-term derivative liabilities,” or “Other long-term liabilities.” The Company determines the current and noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows of individual trades and reports these amounts on a gross basis. Additionally, the Company reports, if any, cash held on deposit in margin accounts for coffee-related derivative instruments on a gross basis on its consolidated balance sheet in “Restricted cash.”The accounting for the changes in fair value of the Company's derivative instruments can be summarized as follows:Derivative TreatmentAccounting MethodNormal purchases and normal sales exceptionAccrual accountingDesignated in a qualifying hedging relationshipHedge accountingAll other derivative instrumentsMark-to-market accountingThe Company enters into green coffee purchase commitments at a fixed price or at a price to be fixed (“PTF”). PTF contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, price differential to the coffee “C” market price and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price at which the base “C” market price will be fixed has not yet been established. The coffee “C” market price is fixed at some point after the purchase contract date and before the futures market closes for the delivery month and may be fixed either at the direction of the Company to the vendor, or by the application of a derivative that was separately purchased as a hedge. For both fixed-price and PTF contracts, the Company expects to take delivery of and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time and in the conduct of normal business. Accordingly, these purchase commitments qualify as normal purchases and are not recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.The Company follows the guidelines of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”), to account for certain coffee-related derivative instruments as accounting hedges, in order to minimize the volatility created in the Company's quarterly results from utilizing these derivative instruments and to improve comparability between reporting periods. For a derivative to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific criteria and the Company must maintain appropriate documentation. The Company establishes hedging relationships F - 9Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)pursuant to its risk management policies. The hedging relationships are evaluated at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. The Company also regularly assesses whether the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no longer expected to be highly effective, or if the Company believes the likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued for that derivative, and future changes in the fair value of that derivative are recognized in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.For coffee-related derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the derivative is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold in the period or periods when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains or losses deferred in AOCI associated with terminated derivative instruments, derivative instruments that cease to be highly effective hedges, derivative instruments for which the forecasted transaction is reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in AOCI until the hedged item affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not occur, any gain or loss deferred in AOCI is recognized in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations at that time. For derivative instruments that are not designated in a hedging relationship, and for which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has not been elected, the changes in fair value are reported in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 4, Derivative Instruments.Concentration of Credit RiskAt June 30, 2025, the financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash in financial institutions (in excess of federally insured limits), derivative instruments and trade receivables. The Company does not have any credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, none of the cash in the Company’s coffee-related derivative margin accounts was restricted. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held, could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under certain of the Company's broker and counterparty agreements.Approximately 22% and 11% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance was with five customers at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2025. The Company estimates its credit risk for accounts receivable at the amount recorded on the balance sheet. The accounts receivable are generally short-term and all estimated credit losses have been appropriately considered in establishing the allowance for credit losses.InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company uses the first in, first out ("FIFO") basis for accounting for coffee, tea and culinary products and coffee brewing equipment parts. The Company regularly evaluates these inventories to determine the provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventory. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of specific identification. Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are used: Buildings and facilities10 to 30 yearsMachinery and equipment3 to 15 yearsOffice furniture and equipment5 to 7 yearsCapitalized software3 to 5 yearsEquipment under finance leasesShorter of term of lease or estimated useful lifeLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. When assets are sold or retired, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective account balances and any gain or loss on disposal is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and enhancements are capitalized. Coffee Brewing Equipment and ServiceThe Company capitalizes coffee brewing equipment and depreciates it over five years and reports the depreciation expense in cost of goods sold. Other non-depreciation expenses related to coffee brewing equipment provided to customers, such as the cost of servicing that equipment (including service employees’ salaries, cost of transportation and the cost of supplies and parts), are considered directly attributable to the generation of revenues from the customers. These non-depreciation expenses are also included in cost of goods sold. See Note 9, Property, Plant and Equipment for details of the depreciation amounts and F - 10Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)non-depreciation expenses.LeasesThe Company makes a determination if an arrangement constitutes a lease at inception, and categorizes the lease as either an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company has entered into leases for building facilities, vehicles and other equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining contractual terms of up to 7 years, some of which have options to extend the lease for up to an additional 10 years. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms are deemed not to include options to extend the lease renewals until it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Right-of-use lease assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is primarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are combined for certain assets. Income TaxesDeferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse. Estimating the Company’s tax liabilities involves judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company makes certain estimates and judgments to determine tax expense for financial statement purposes as it evaluates the effect of tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, some of which result from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue or expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Changes to these estimates may result in significant changes to the Company’s tax provision in future periods.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if a valuation allowance is required and considers whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets based on the likelihood that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will or will not ultimately be realized in future periods. In making this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified, such as recent operating results, and less consideration is given to less objective indicators, such as future income projections. After consideration of positive and negative evidence, if the Company determines that it is more likely than not that it will generate future income sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, the Company will record a reduction in the valuation allowance.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue at a point in time upon delivery of the ordered goods to our customers. Revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances, rebates and incentives. The Company performs the following steps to determine revenue recognition for an arrangement: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.Net Loss Per Common ShareNet loss per share (“EPS”) represents net loss available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dividends on the Company's outstanding Series A Convertible Participating Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Series A Preferred Stock"), that the Company has paid or intends to pay are deducted from net loss in computing net loss available to common stockholders.Under the two-class method, net loss available to nonvested restricted stockholders and holders of Series A Preferred Stock is excluded from net loss available to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted EPS.Diluted EPS represents net loss available to holders of common stock divided by the weighted-average number of common F - 11Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares include potentially dilutive shares from share-based compensation including stock options, unvested restricted stock, unvested performance-based restricted stock units, and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as converted, because they are deemed participating securities. In the absence of contrary information, the Company assumes 100% of the target shares are issuable under performance-based restricted stock units.Share-based CompensationThe Company measures all share-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the fair values of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, and recognizes that cost as an expense on a straight line-basis in its consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period. Fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires management to make certain assumptions for estimating the fair value of stock options at the date of grant. In addition, the Company estimates the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognizes share-based compensation cost only for those awards ultimately expected to vest. If actual forfeiture rates differ materially from the Company’s estimates, share-based compensation expense could differ significantly from the amounts the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company periodically reviews actual forfeiture experience and will revise its estimates, as necessary. The Company will recognize as compensation cost the cumulative effect of the change in estimated forfeiture rates on current and prior periods in earnings of the period of revision. As a result, if the Company revises its assumptions and estimates, the Company’s share-based compensation expense could change materially in the future. The Company's outstanding share-based awards include performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") that have performance-based vesting conditions in addition to time-based vesting. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial and other performance criteria as a condition to the vesting. The Company recognizes the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, net of estimated forfeitures, as share-based compensation expense over the service period based upon the Company’s determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment, and the estimate of share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. If performance goals are not met, no share-based compensation expense is recognized for the cancelled PNQs or PBRSUs and, to the extent share-based compensation expense was previously recognized for those cancelled PNQs or PBRSUs, such share-based compensation expense is reversed. If performance goals are exceeded and the payout is more than 100% of the target shares, additional compensation expense is recorded in the period when that determination is certified by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company also has Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units ("CSRSUs") which are accounted for as liability awards, with compensation expense measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of forfeitures. Compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting date with a cumulative adjustment to compensation cost during the period based on changes in the Common Stock's closing share price.Impairment of Indefinite-lived Intangible AssetsThe Company accounts for its indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (“ASC 350”). Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate that an asset might be impaired. Pursuant to ASC 350, the Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain acquired trademarks, trade names and a brand name, for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. An impairment charge is recorded if the estimated fair value of such assets has decreased below their carrying values. Other Intangible AssetsOther intangible assets consist of finite-lived intangible assets including customer relationships. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment by grouping them with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance, and may differ from actual cash flows. If the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made. The Company reviews the recoverability of its finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. F - 12Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Collective Bargaining AgreementsCertain Company employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements which expire on or before January 31, 2028. At June 30, 2025 approximately 23% of the Company's workforce was covered by such agreements.Self-InsuranceThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liability of certain risks including workers’ compensation, health care benefits, general liability, product liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with risks retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.The Company's self-insurance for workers’ compensation liability includes estimated outstanding losses of unpaid claims, and allocated loss adjustment expenses (“ALAE”), case reserves, the development of known claims and incurred but not reported claims. ALAE are the direct expenses for settling specific claims. The amounts reflect per occurrence and annual aggregate limits maintained by the Company. The estimated liability analysis does not include estimating a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expenses.The estimated gross undiscounted workers’ compensation liability relating to such claims was $2.5 million and $2.0 million, as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The estimated recovery from reinsurance was $0.2 million and $0.2 million, as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The short-term and long-term accrued liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheets in “Other current liabilities” and in “Accrued workers' compensation liabilities,” respectively. The estimated insurance receivable is included in “Other assets” on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company had posted $4.7 million and $4.1 million letters of credit as a security deposit for self-insuring workers’ compensation, general liability and auto insurance coverages as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The estimated liability related to the Company's self-insured group medical insurance was $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, recorded on an incurred but not reported basis, within deductible limits, based on actual claims and the average lag time between the date insurance claims are filed and the date those claims are paid. The Company accrues the cost for general liability, product liability and commercial auto liability insurance based on estimates of the aggregate liability claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. The Company's liability reserve for such claims was $2.0 million and $1.6 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The estimated liability related to the Company's self-insured group medical insurance, general liability, product liability and commercial auto liability is included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets in “Other current liabilities.”Postretirement BenefitsThe Company provided a postretirement death benefit (“Death Benefit”) to certain employees and retirees, subject, in the case of current employees, to continued employment with the Company until retirement and certain other conditions related to the manner of employment termination and manner of death. The Company records the actuarially determined liability for the present value of the postretirement death benefit. The Company purchased life insurance policies to fund the postretirement death benefit wherein the Company owns the policy but the postretirement death benefit is paid to the employee's or retiree's beneficiary. The Company records an asset for the fair value of the life insurance policies which equates to the cash surrender value of the policies. We completed a full settlement of the Death Benefit plan and related life insurance policies in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.Pension PlansThe Company’s defined benefit pension plans are not admitting new participants, therefore, changes to pension liabilities are primarily due to market fluctuations of investments for existing participants and changes in interest rates. The Company’s defined benefit pension plans are accounted for using the guidance of ASC 710, “Compensation—General“ and ASC 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits“ and are measured as of the end of the fiscal year.The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension as an asset or liability on its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the funded status are recognized through AOCI, in the year in which the changes occur. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed a full settlement of the “Hourly Employees' Plan” through the purchase of nonparticipating annuities and lump sum elections.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed a partial settlement of the
defined benefit plan (the "Farmer Bros. Plan") through the purchase of nonparticipating annuities and lump sum elections. See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans.F - 13Farmer Bros.

Sales of AssetsSale of Branch PropertiesDuring the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company completed the sale of 2 branch properties. The total sales price was $4.6 million and net proceeds was $4.2 million. The completed sale of branch properties resulted in a gain on sale of $3.9 million. There were no assets held for sale at June 30, 2025.During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of 13 branch properties. The total sales price was $31.7 million and net proceeds was $29.3 million. The completed sale of branch properties resulted in a gain on sale of $21.5 million.Note 4. Derivative InstrumentsDerivative Instruments HeldCoffee-Related Derivative InstrumentsThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk associated with its price to be fixed green coffee purchase contracts, which are described further in Note 2. The Company utilizes forward and option contracts to manage exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows from forecasted purchases of green coffee attributable to commodity price risk. Certain of these coffee-related derivative instruments utilized for risk management purposes have been designated as cash flow hedges, while other coffee-related derivative instruments have not been designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting despite hedging the Company's future cash flows on an economic basis.All derivative instruments designated and not designated as cash flow hedges were settled as of March 2025.The following table summarizes the notional volumes for the coffee-related derivative instruments held by the Company at June 30, 2025 and 2024:As of June 30,(In thousands)20252024Derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges:Long coffee pounds— 71 Total— 71 F - 14Farmer Bros.

All derivatives were settled for the year-ended June 30, 2025, resulting in a $313 thousand net gain recognized in earnings - coffee-related in the current year. Offsetting of Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesThe Company has agreements in place that allow for the financial right of offset for derivative assets and liabilities at settlement or in the event of default under the agreements. Additionally, under certain coffee derivative agreements, the Company maintains accounts with its counterparties to facilitate financial derivative transactions in support of its risk management activities.F - 15Farmer Bros.

Note 5. LeasesThe Company has entered into leases for building facilities, vehicles and other equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining contractual terms through March 31, 2032, some of which have options to extend the lease for up to 10 years. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms are deemed not to include options to extend the lease renewal until it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Supplemental consolidated balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:As of June 30,(In thousands)Classification20252024Operating lease assetsRight-of-use operating lease assets$38,347 $35,241 Finance lease assetsProperty, plant and equipment, net82 246 Total lease assets$38,429 $35,487 Operating lease liabilities - currentOperating lease liabilities - current16,773 14,046 Finance lease liabilities - currentOther current liabilities96 193Operating lease liabilities - noncurrentOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent22,195 21,766 Finance lease liabilities - noncurrentOther long-term liabilities— 82Total lease liabilities$39,064 $36,087 The components of lease expense are as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,(In thousands)20252024Operating lease expense$19,318 $13,785 Finance lease expense:Amortization of finance lease assets164 164 Interest on finance lease liabilities13 24 Total lease expense$19,495 $13,973 The maturities of the lease liabilities are as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,(In thousands)Operating LeasesFinance Leases2026$16,773 $96 202711,159 — 20288,108 — 20294,884 — 20301,601 — Thereafter1,130 — Total lease payments43,655 96 Less: interest (4,687)— Total lease obligations$38,968 $96 F - 16Farmer Bros.

Basis Used to Determine Expected Long-term Return on Plan AssetsThe expected long-term return on plan assets assumption was developed as a weighted average rate based on the target asset allocation of the plan and the Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (CMA) for the corresponding fiscal year end. The capital market assumptions were developed with a primary focus on forward-looking valuation models and market indicators. The key fundamental economic inputs for these models are future inflation, economic growth, and interest rate environment. F - 20Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Due to the long-term nature of the pension obligations, the investment horizon for the CMA 2020 is 20 to 30 years. In addition to forward-looking models, historical analysis of market data and trends was reflected, as well as the outlook of recognized economists, organizations and consensus CMA from other credible studies. Description of Investment PolicyThe Company’s investment strategy is to build an efficient, well-diversified portfolio based on a long-term, strategic outlook of the investment markets. The investment markets outlook utilizes both the historical-based and forward-looking return forecasts to establish future return expectations for various asset classes. These return expectations are used to develop a core asset allocation based on the specific needs of each plan. The core asset allocation utilizes investment portfolios of various asset classes and multiple investment managers in order to maximize the plan’s return while providing multiple layers of diversification to help minimize risk.Additional Disclosures Farmer Bros.

The Company makes contributions to this plan generally based on the number of hours worked by the participants in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Pension Protection Act Zone StatusPension FundEIN-PNAs of 1/1/2025Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan91-6145047-001GreenThe Company also contributes to two defined contribution pension plans ("All Other Plans") that are union sponsored and collectively bargained for the benefit of certain employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company’s minimum contributions to these plans are defined within the collective bargaining agreements.Contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans were as follows:(In thousands)WCTPP(1)(2)(3)All Other PlansYear Ended:June 30, 2025$1,347 $41 June 30, 20241,248 35 ____________(1)Individually significant plan. (2)Less than 5% of total contribution to WCTPP based on WCTPP's FASB Disclosure Statement (3)The Company guarantees that one hundred seventy-three (173) hours will be contributed upon for all employees who are compensated for all available straight time hours for each calendar month. An additional 6.5% of the basic contribution must be paid for PEER or the Program for Enhanced Early Retirement.The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans in that: (i) assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and (iii) if the Company stops participating in the multiemployer plan, the Company may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.Future collective bargaining negotiations may result in the Company withdrawing from the remaining multiemployer pension plans in which it participates and, if successful, the Company may incur a withdrawal liability, the amount of which could be material to the Company's results of operations and cash flows.Multiemployer Plans Other Than Pension PlansThe Company participates in nine multiemployer defined contribution plans other than pension plans that provide medical, vision, dental and disability benefits for active, union-represented employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The plans are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and provide that participating employers make monthly contributions to the plans in an amount as specified in the collective bargaining agreements. Also, the plans provide that participants make self-payments to the plans, the amounts of which are negotiated through the collective bargaining process. The Company's participation in these plans is governed by collective bargaining agreements which expires on or before January 31, 2028. The Company's aggregate contributions to multiemployer plans other than pension plans in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were $3.9 million, respectively. The Company expects to contribute an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million towards multiemployer plans other than pension plans in fiscal 2026.F - 22Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)401(k) PlanThe Farmer Bros. Co. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") is available to all eligible employees. The 401(k) Plan match portion, to the extent a match is approved by the Company's Board of Directors, is available to all eligible employees who have worked more than 1,000 hours during a calendar year and were employed at the end of the calendar year. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may choose to contribute a percentage of their annual pay subject to the maximum contribution allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's matching contribution is discretionary, based on approval by the Company's Board of Directors. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company amended the 401(k) matching program, whereby the Company on an annual basis will contribute cash for 100% of the first 3% each eligible employee contributes plus 50% on the next 2% they contribute. Effective August 1, 2024, the Company suspended the 401(k) matching program. The Company recorded matching contributions of $0.3 million and $1.3 million in operating expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
There were no shares contributed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 the Company contributed a total of 595,031 shares of the Company’s common stock with a value of $1.9 million to eligible participants’ annual plan compensation.

The Fourth Amendment amends that certain Revolver Credit Facility Agreement, originally entered into by and among the parties on April 26, 2021. The Fourth Amendment includes a consent to the Sale by the administrative agent and the lenders and amends certain terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement by, among other things: (i) reflecting the payoff in full, with proceeds from the Sale, of the $47.0 million outstanding amount of the Term Loan, (ii) reflecting the paydown, with proceeds from the Sale, of the Revolver Credit Facility (and a reduction of the maximum commitment of the lenders under the Revolver Credit Facility to $75.0 million), (iii) releasing liens of the administrative agent securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement on assets sold pursuant to the Sale, and (iv) amending the Credit Agreement so that the Company's financial covenant (i.e., fixed charge coverage ratio) is only in effect during such times when the Company's liquidity falls below certain thresholds.On December 4, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into that certain Consent and Amendment No. 5 to Credit Agreement (the “Consent and Amendment”), with the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for each member of the lender group (in such capacity, the “Agent”) to amend certain terms of the Revolver Credit Facility Agreement, including the definition of specified real property and the release of security interests in certain real properties. The following is a summary description of the Revolver Credit Facility Agreement and the Revolver Security Agreement (the "Revolver Security Facility") key items. The Revolver Credit Facility Agreement, among other things include:
1.a commitment of up to $75.0 million (“Revolver”) calculated as the lesser of (a) $75.0 million or (b) the amount equal to the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable (less a dilution reserve), plus (ii) the lesser of: (a) 80% of eligible raw material inventory, eligible in-transit inventory and eligible finished goods inventory (collectively, “Eligible Inventory”), and (b) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of Eligible Inventory, minus (c) applicable reserve;2.sublimit on letters of credit of $10.0 million;3.maturity date of April 26, 2027 and has no scheduled payback required on the principal prior to the maturity date;4.fully collateralized by all existing and future capital stock of the Borrowers (other than the Company) and all of the Borrowers' personal and real property;5.interest under the Revolver is either  if the relevant Obligation is a SOFR Loan, at a per annum rate equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Margin (1.75%), and otherwise, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate + 0.50% or Term SOFR +1%) plus the Base Rate Margin (0.75%).; and6.in the event that Borrowers’ availability to borrow under the Revolver falls below $9.375 million, the financial covenant requires the Company to meet or exceed a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00:1.00 at all such times.The Revolver Credit Facility Agreement and the Revolver Security Agreement contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type that, among other things, require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants and restrict the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments and acquisitions, repurchase its stock and prepay certain indebtedness, create liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of its business, transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Revolver Credit Facility Agreement becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments.

All PBRSU awards are subject to certain continued employment conditions and subject to acceleration provisions of the award plan and restricted stock unit agreement. At the end of the performance period, the number of PBRSUs that actually vest will be a percentage of the target amount, depending on the extent to which the Company meets or exceeds the achievement of those financial performance goals measured over the performance period. PBRSUs are expected to vest net of estimated forfeitures.The following table summarizes PBRSU activity for the year ended June 30, 2025:Outstanding and Nonvested PBRSUs:PBRSUs AwardedWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value ($)Outstanding at June 30, 2024394,576 2.95Granted584,741 2.20Vested— —Cancelled/Forfeited(145,000)2.31Outstanding and nonvested June 30, 2025834,317 2.53The weighted average grant date fair value of PBRSUs granted during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were $2.20 and $2.95, respectively.

The unrecognized compensation cost related to PBRSUs at June 30, 2025 is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.03 years. Total compensation expense for PBRSUs was $0.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 and $0.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units (“CSRSUs”)In December 2020, the Company granted CSRSUs under the Amended 2017 Plan to certain employees. CSRSUs vest in F - 26Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)equal installments over a three-year period from the grant date, and are cash-settled upon vesting based on the Common Stock's closing share price on the vesting date. The CSRSUs are accounted for as liability awards, and compensation expense is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period net of forfeitures. Compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting date with a cumulative adjustment to compensation cost during the period based on changes in the Common Stock's closing share price.

Net operating losses of $74.0 million in federal and $8.8 million of state are indefinite lived and will not expire. Additionally, at June 30, 2025, the Company had $0.9 million of federal and state tax credits.In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers whether it is probable that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining whether the deferred taxes are realizable, the Company considers the period of expiration of the tax asset, historical and projected taxable income, and tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce the amounts of deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts.For the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, due to recent cumulative losses, the Company concluded that certain federal and state net operating loss carry forwards and tax credit carryovers will not be utilized before expiration. The amounts of valuation allowance recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $74.5 million and $75.4 million to reduce deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of, and for the three years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had no significant uncertain tax positions.On July 4, 2025 the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Company does not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements. As the legislation was signed into law after the close of year end, the impacts are not included in our operating results for the year ended June 30, 2025.F - 28Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in various state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. income tax examinations for the fiscal years prior to June 30, 2022. We report income-based tax in multiple states with various years open to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company does not believe the outcome of any future audit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. There were no amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, associated with uncertain tax positions. Additionally, the Company did not record any income tax expense related to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 .Note 17. Net Loss Per Common Share Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing diluted net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect, if dilutive, of the exercise of in-the-money stock options, unvested performance-based restricted stock units, unvested RSUs and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as converted, during the periods presented. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such option’s exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period). Potentially dilutive securities include unvested RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units. For the year ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, shares of the Company’s outstanding RSUs, PBRSUs, preferred stock and stock options were not included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as their effects were anti-dilutive.The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted loss per common share, net of income taxes:For the Years Ended June 30,(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)20252024Net loss available to common stockholders—basic$(14,516)$(3,875)Weighted average common shares outstanding—basic and diluted21,394,543 20,873,266 Net loss per common share available to common stockholders—basic and diluted$(0.68)$(0.19)The following table summarizes anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the periods indicated:For the Years Ended June 30,20252024Shares issuable under stock options18,107 19,450 Shares issuable under RSUs and PBRSUs488,724 203,726 Note 18.

It is management’s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Note 19. Revenue Recognition The Company’s primary sources of revenue are sales of coffee, tea and culinary products. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer and in amounts that the Company expects F - 29Farmer Bros. Co.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)to collect. The timing of revenue recognition takes into consideration the various shipping terms applicable to the Company’s sales. The Company delivers products to customers through DSD to the Company’s customers at their place of business and directly from the Company’s warehouse to the customer’s warehouse, facility or address. Each delivery or shipment made to a third party customer is to satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations generally occur at a point in time and are satisfied when control of the goods passes to the customer. The Company is entitled to collection of the sales price under normal credit terms in the regions in which it operates.The Company disaggregates net sales from contracts with customers based on the characteristics of the products sold:For the Years Ended June 30,20252024(In thousands)$% of total$% of totalNet Sales by Product Category:Coffee (Roasted)$164,533 48.1 %$158,113 46.4 %Tea & Other Beverages (1)92,308 27.0 %90,069 26.4 %Culinary60,193 17.6 %65,938 19.3 %Spices20,534 6.0 %21,911 6.4 %Delivery Surcharge4,713 1.3 %5,063 1.5 %Net sales by product category$342,281 100.0 %$341,094 100.0 %____________(1)Includes all beverages other than roasted coffee, including frozen liquid coffee, and iced and hot tea, including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and concentrated and ready-to drink cold brew and iced coffee.The Company does not have any material contract assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2025. Receivables from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts receivable, net” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2025 and 2024 “Accounts receivable, net” included, $24.3 million and $34.4 million respectively, in receivables from contracts with customers.Note 20. Business InformationThe Company operates as one operating segment. The Company is a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea and other allied products manufactured under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. The Company uses a centralized management structure, and its strategies and initiatives are implemented and executed consistently across the organization. The Company uses shared resources for sales, procurement, and general and administrative activities across its distribution facility, branch warehouses and operations. The Company’s branch warehouses form a single network to reach its customers; it is common for a single customer to make purchases from several different facilities. Capital projects, whether for cost savings or generating incremental revenue, are evaluated based on estimated economic returns to the organization as a whole.The Company’s consolidated results represent the results of its one operating segment based on how the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”), views the business for purposes of evaluating performance and making operating decisions.The CODM utilizes the U.S. GAAP measurement of consolidated net income to assess financial performance and allocate resources. This financial metric is used by the CODM to make key operating decisions, such as allocation of budget between net sales, cost of goods sold, distribution costs and selling and administrative costs. The measure of segment assets is reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as total consolidated assets. In addition, the measure of capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization is reported on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. F - 30
