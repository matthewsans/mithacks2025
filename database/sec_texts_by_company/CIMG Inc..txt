Our Holding Company Structure and Risks Related to Doing Business in China
Our
business operations are partially based in China, and our PRC Subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and operational risks
associated with being based in China. On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”), and 12 other
relevant PRC government authorities published the amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February 15,
2022. The final Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that a “network platform operator” that possesses personal
information of more than one million users and seeks a listing in a foreign country must apply for a cybersecurity review. Further,
the relevant PRC governmental authorities may initiate a cybersecurity review against any company if they determine certain network
products, services, or data processing activities of such company affect or may affect national security. As of the date of this
report, our Company and its subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any PRC
regulatory authority, nor has any of them received any inquiry, notice or sanction. As advised by our PRC counsel, Guangdong Shenmou
Law Firm (“Guangdong Shenmou”), we do not believe that we are subject to: (a) the cybersecurity review with the CAC, as we do not possess a large amount
of personal information in our business operations, and our business does not involve the collection of data that affects or may
affect national security, implicates cybersecurity, or involves any type of restricted industry; or (b) merger control review by
China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the fact that we do not engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to
these statements or regulatory actions.
On
February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) issued the Trial Administrative Measures of
Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, which became effective on March 31, 2023.
Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly,
should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC. As advised by our PRC counsel, Guangdong Shenmou,
we are a domestic company incorporated in the United States, and the operation of a portion of our business in the PRC does not, by
itself, subject us to the Trial Measures or related filing requirements. However, due to uncertainties in the interpretation of PRC
laws and regulations, as well as ongoing regulatory reviews of overseas listings involving PRC companies through offshore holding
structures, we may be required to submit a filing with the CSRC in the future in connection with our operations in China. Such risks
could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities and could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or be worthless. Please see “Item 1A —Risk Factors—Risks Associated With Doing Business in China”
and the associated risk factor on page 30.
Since
2021, the Chinese government has strengthened its anti-monopoly supervision, mainly in three aspects: (1) establishing the National Anti-Monopoly
Bureau; (2) revising and promulgating anti-monopoly laws and regulations, including: the Anti-Monopoly Law (draft Amendment published
on October 23, 2021 for public opinions), the anti-monopoly guidelines for various industries, and the detailed Rules for the Implementation
of the Fair Competition Review System; and (3) expanding the anti-monopoly law enforcement targeting Internet companies and large enterprises.
As of the date of this report, the Chinese government’s recent statements and regulatory actions related to anti-monopoly concerns
have not impacted our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange because neither
the Company nor its PRC operating entities engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions.
Please see “Item 1A —Risk Factors—Risks Associated With Doing Business in China” and the associated risk factor
on page 30.
Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations
We
are also subject to legal and operational risks associated with being based in and having part of the Company’s operations in China.
These risks may result in a material change in our operations, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our
securities to investors, and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Recently, the PRC
government initiated a series of regulatory actions and guidelines to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas
using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts
in anti-monopoly enforcement. On July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office
of the State Council, or the State Council, jointly issued an announcement to crack down on illegal activities in the securities market
and promote the high-quality development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities
to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over China-based companies listed
overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws. On December 28, 2021, the
CAC, together with 12 other governmental departments of the PRC, jointly promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became
effective on February 15, 2022. Article 7 of the Cybersecurity Review Measures stipulates that “Network platform operators that
hold personal information of more than one million users and plan to go public abroad must report to the Cybersecurity Review Office
for a cybersecurity review.”
3
As
confirmed by our PRC counsel, Guangdong Shenmou Law Firm since we are not an online platform operator that possesses over one
million users’ personal information, we are not subject to the cybersecurity review with the CAC under the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, and for the same reason, we will not be subject to the network data security review by the CAC though another bill,
the Regulations on the Security Management of Network Data, came into effect on January 1, 2025. As such, we believe that, as of the
date of this Annual Report, we are compliant with the regulations and policies that have been issued by the CAC. As of the date of
this Annual Report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the Company’s ability to conduct its business, accept
foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange; however, there are uncertainties in the interpretation and
enforcement of these new laws and guidelines, which could materially and adversely impact our business and financial outlook. See
“Item 1A —Risk Factors— Risks Associated With Doing Business in China.”
On
February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and five supporting guidelines, which came
into effect on March 31, 2023. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (the “SCNPC”) or PRC regulatory
authorities may in the future promulgate additional laws, regulations, or implementing rules that require us to obtain regulatory approval
from Chinese authorities. If we do not receive or maintain such approval, or inadvertently conclude that such approval is not required,
or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject
to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks
could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our shares of common stock, significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value
or become worthless.
Cash
Flows through Our Organization
CIMG,
and our non-PRC Subsidiaries, may transfer cash to our PRC subsidiaries, through capital injections and intra-group loans. As advised
by our PRC counsel, Guangdong Shenmou Law Firm, current PRC regulations permit Beijing Zhongyan to pay dividends to DZR Tech, only out
of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. If we determine to pay
dividends on any of our Common Stock in the future, as a holding company, we will be dependent on receipt of funds from our Hong Kong
subsidiary, DZR Tech. DZR Tech will rely on payments made from Beijing Zhongyan, which will in turn rely on payments made from Beijing
Xilin, Shanghai Huomao and Henan Zhongyan. In addition, Beijing Zhongyan requires at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if
any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital.
During
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there is cash transfers of $220,000 and $Nil occurred between the Company
and its subsidiaries.
Under
mainland China laws and regulations, we are subject to restrictions on foreign exchange and cross-border cash transfers, including to
CIMG, our non-PRC Subsidiaries, and U.S. investors. Our ability to distribute earnings to CIMG, non-PRC Subsidiaries, and U.S. investors
is also limited. We are partially relying on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC Subsidiaries for our cash requirements,
including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any debt we may incur outside
of mainland China. Current mainland China regulations permit our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated
after-tax profits upon satisfaction of relevant statutory conditions and procedures, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting
standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC Subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each
year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until the total amount set aside reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves, together
with the registered capital, are not distributable as cash dividends. Additionally, if our PRC Subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf
in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. In
addition, the revenue and assets of our PRC Subsidiaries are generally denominated in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into
other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to
us.
4
We
have established certain controls and procedures for cash flows within our organization. Each transfer of cash among our Nevada holding
company holding company and our subsidiaries is subject to internal approval to maximize oversight, minimize risk, and ensure compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Risks Associated With Doing Business in China.”
Cash
Management Policies
The
Company has comprehensive cash management policies in place, including specific policies governing approvals with respect to fund transfers
throughout our organization.
Our
Board of Directors and the audit committee oversee the Company’s major financial risk exposures. The Company maintains an authorization
policy on cash management, setting forth the scope of authority for certain treasury matters that are delegated by the Board of Directors
to management. Under this policy, certain treasury matters, such as intercompany loans, bank borrowings, short-term and long-term investments
and dividends distributed from the Company’s subsidiaries to the holding company, are clearly defined, with the level of approval
required for each matter specifically identified.
Our
management regularly monitors the liquidity position, funding requirements and investment returns in different jurisdictions of our subsidiaries,
and takes into consideration regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Company has subsidiaries or operations. When
funding is required, all necessary approvals are obtained from Company management and relevant governmental authorities, including China’s
State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
The
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
On
April 21, 2020, the SEC and PCAOB released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or having
substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for
the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.
On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, because of positions
taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The Board made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework
for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCA Act.
On
August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”), and the PCAOB signed the Protocol, governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based
in China and Hong Kong.
On
December 15, 2022, the PCAOB determined that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and vacated its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities
obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB’s access in the future, the PCAOB may consider the need to issue a new determination.
On
December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, amending the HFCA Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if
its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.
Any
lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China may prevent the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of
the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the
PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’
audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which
could cause existing and potential investors to lose confidence in audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality
of financial statements of China-based companies.
Our
auditor, Assentsure PAC, the independent registered public accounting firm is a PCAOB-registered public accounting firm headquartered in Singapore. Our current auditor is subject to laws in the United
States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess an auditor’s compliance with the applicable professional
standards, and have been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis. As such, as of the date of this Annual Report, our listing is not
affected by the HFCA Act and related regulations. However, the recent developments would add uncertainties to our listing and we cannot
assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness
of our auditor’s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources,
geographic reach or experience as related to the audit of our financial statements. Furthermore, there is a risk that our auditor cannot
be inspected by the PCAOB in the future. The lack of inspection could cause trading in our securities to be prohibited on a national
exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market under the HFCA Act and related regulations, and, as a result, Nasdaq may determine
to delist our securities, which may cause the value of our securities to decline or become worthless. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—
Risks Associated With Doing Business in China” call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies
upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board of the United States (the “PCAOB”). These developments could add uncertainties to our listing on the Nasdaq
Capital Market and Nasdaq may determine to delist our securities if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate
our auditor, which may cause the value of our securities to decline or become worthless.

PART
I
ITEM
1. BUSINESS.
Overview
CIMG
Inc. is a company incorporated in Nevada and listed on Nasdaq since June 2020. We were formerly known as “Nuzee, Inc.” with
a previous ticker symbol “NUZE”, and we changed our corporate name and ticker symbol to “CIMG Inc.” and “IMG”
in October 2024. We previously focused on specialty coffee and related technologies but are now expanding our sales and distribution
channels in Asia to encompass a broader range of consumer food and beverage products. This expansion is fueled by our online sales platform,
which leverages a natural language search function.
On
June 7, 2024, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“Share Purchase Agreement”) with Masateru Higashida, our former
Chief Executive Officer and Director, under which we sold all issued and outstanding shares of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, NuZee KOREA
Ltd. and NuZee Investment Co., Ltd., to Mr. Higashida, which sale was completed in June 2024.
Since
July 2024, CIMG has been undergoing a transformation in digital marketing, distribution, and sales. As part of this transformation, we
have extended our sales and distribution network to include maca-enhanced food and beverages, reaffirming our commitment to reshaping
the online marketing, sales, and distribution landscape for consumer products.
Maca,
a plant of the Brassicaceae family that originated in South America, has oval leaves and a rootstock shaped like a small round radish.
It is edible and renowned as a natural superfood. Maca is rich in nutrients, boasts high levels of essential nutrients, and is believed
to nourish and strengthen the human body. It is often referred to as “South American ginseng.” The primary cultivation regions
for maca include the Andes Mountains in South America and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Lijiang, Yunnan, China.
CIMG
has successfully secured the exclusive distribution and sales rights for all maca products produced by Jiangsu Kangduoyuan Beverage Co.,
Ltd., a leading maca production base in Asia. These products include Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Wine, Maca Purified Powder,
and other full-range offerings. Through a comprehensive digital marketing strategy, CIMG is optimistic in its ability to achieve sales
growth and enhance the Company’s enterprise value.
CIMG
aims to become a leading distributor of premium maca products, a natural superfood known for its numerous health benefits. Our business
focuses on sourcing, marketing, and distributing a wide range of maca-based dietary supplements, functional foods, and beauty products.
We operate with a commitment to providing high-quality, sustainably sourced products to consumers who seek to enhance their health and
wellness. Our products are sold through both online channels and a network of retail partners, including grocery stores, convenience
stores, and vending machines.

Co-Packing
and Product Innovation
With
years of experience as a third-party contract packer for leading companies in the coffee beverage industry, combined with our own coffee
sales and market insights from the Asian region, we have expanded our business strategy to deepen our industry engagement. This evolution
includes a shift toward reshaping product value by integrating health-oriented concepts and applying advanced technologies such as artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, and big data. These efforts have culminated in the establishment of a global digital health and sales development
business group.
While
we remain committed to delivering our high-quality single-serving coffee and DRIPKIT products, our entry into the Asian market
has prompted a broader commitment to health, sustainability, and nutrition.
The
Maca Series
In
the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2024, we introduced our first health-focused product line in Asia: the Maca Series.
This product line includes Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Purified Powder, and Maca Wine. Each product features green purification
factors derived from the maca plant, ensuring a natural and clean composition.

on March 21, 2025. We subsequently acquired Shanghai Huomao on April 22, 2025, and Beijing Xilin on March 31, 2025. Today, we are one
of the largest distributors of maca products in Hong Kong, the PRC, and other Asian markets. Our strategy focuses on leveraging local
relationships to establish long-term partnerships across these regions.
Our
customers and products
Our
customers primarily include wholesale distributors.
We
sell the Maca Series products to wholesale distributors such as grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine providers. Our
core product line mainly consists of a variety of maca-based products designed to cater to the growing demand for natural health supplements.
These products include Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Purified Powder, and Maca Wine.
Maca-Noni
Maca-Noni
is a maca-enhanced plant-based energy drink, with its consumption scenarios overlapping with traditional energy drinks such as Red Bull.
It helps consumers quickly replenish energy in various situations such as traveling, working, and exercising, allowing them to maintain
good performance. Unlike traditional energy drinks, Maca-Noni is made primarily from maca extracts, and does not contain caffeine. As
a result, it is a healthier alternative compared to conventional energy drinks, and long-term consumption also offers health benefits.
10
The
first batch of Maca-Noni plant-based energy drinks is available in 250ml cans, with packaging designed to appeal to younger consumers.
The bottle features a “professional role bottle” design, selecting 66 professions and 132 facial expressions from the target
consumer group, including drivers, workers, students, athletes, fitness enthusiasts, lawyers, doctors, streamers, and e-commerce operators,
which adds emotional appeal and storytelling to the product.
We
emphasize the importance of quality, sustainability, and transparency in the sourcing and production of our maca. Our maca is
primarily sourced from Yunnan, China, where it is cultivated in high-altitude regions that naturally enhance its potency. We work
closely with local sources in Jiangsu Kangduoyuan Beverage Co., Ltd to ensure sustainable farming practices and fair-trade
standards.
Maca
Peptide Coffee
Our
Maca Peptide Coffee is known for its strong yet smooth, non-bitter taste with a subtle fruity aroma. It is medium-roasted and contains
no added sugar, preserving the original flavor profile. The main ingredients include maca peptide, yellow essence, and Malaysian white
coffee. In our formulation, coffee is added primarily to enhance flavor and deliver the familiar taste of coffee, while the functional
benefits come primarily from the maca and yellow essence.
We
use high-quality maca grown at altitudes of no less than 3,200 meters, with a low yield of approximately 70 kilograms per mu. Maca is
cultivated without the use of pesticides, fertilizers, or growth enhancers. To maximize its potency, harvesting only occurs when the
leaves have turned brown, ensuring peak effectiveness of the raw ingredient.
Maca
Wine
As
a combination of maca and alcohol drinks, Maca Wine has become a popular choice for family gatherings due to its distinctive taste and
health benefits. It not only adds a special flavor to meals but also helps relieve fatigue and improve mental alertness, allowing families
to enjoy their food while promoting wellness.
Maca
Wine is also known for its traditional health functions, including promoting blood circulation, relieving blood stasis, dispelling wind
and dampness, and alleviating symptoms such as cold hands and feet. As a daily wellness beverage, moderate consumption can support physical
regulation, enhance vitality, and improve sleep quality. For those experiencing insomnia, restless sleep, or poor sleep, moderate intake
of Maca Wine may contribute to more restful and restorative sleep.
Maca
Purified Powder
Maca
Purified Powder as a nutritional supplement, rich in protein, amino acids, polysaccharides, minerals and bioactive substances such as
macamide and macalene, these ingredients help to enhance human immunity and improve the body’s resistance. Its natural ingredients
can regulate the human endocrine system, balance hormone levels, help relieve menopause symptoms, improve endocrine disorders and other
problems. At the same time, antioxidant ingredients help to clear free radicals in the body, reduce skin damage, improve skin condition,
make skin smoother and more delicate, enhance skin elasticity, and help delay the aging process.
Market
Opportunity
The
global market for natural and plant-based dietary supplements has seen significant growth in recent years, driven by increasing
consumer awareness of health and wellness. As a result, the demand for maca products has grown substantially, particularly in the
wellness, beauty, and fitness industries. According to market research firm Research Nester’s public report, it is projected that from 2025 to
2037, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the global maca market will exceed 4.2%. It is predicted that this figure will
exceed 106 million US dollars by 2037.
11
Our
company is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend due to our established brand, product offerings, and commitment to quality. We
believe that maca’s versatility as a superfood, combined with its growing recognition in the wellness community, will drive continued
growth for our business.
Operational
capacity
We
currently lease office space in Florida, United States, Hong Kong, and Beijing, China, to serve as offices for our daily operations.
We believe our office space is sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operational requirements.
Our
executive office and administrative operations are now located in Room R2, FTY D, 16/F, Kin Ga Industrial Building, 9 San On Street,
Tuen Mun, Hong Kong.
Distribution
For
the distribution of Maca products to our customers, we currently sell offline. In the future, we plan to achieve joint development of
online and offline sales channels. Offline channels will involve traditional personal convenience stores, chain supermarkets, chain stores,
gas stations, vending machines, etc. The online channel will be multi-platform matrix layout, including TikTok, Alibaba.com, Tencent,
JD.com +AI artificial intelligence, enhance brand exposure, precise audience positioning, multi-channel communication, and improve content
exposure and interaction. Through a comprehensive and systematic e-commerce operations service model, we help brands maximize resource
utilization, accurately target consumers, enhance brand exposure and sales, and optimize the user experience. Based on product attributes,
we identify and coordinate suitable celebrity or influencer collaborations to build brand identity, elevate brand image, increase awareness,
and drive product sales.
Competition
The
maca product market in Asia is competitive, with both local and international brands vying for consumer attention. There is strong growth
potential, especially as consumer interest in natural, functional foods continues to rise. International brands, with their strong emphasis
on quality, organic ingredients, and health benefits, are well-positioned to capture market share in countries like Southeast Asia. However,
local competitors have an advantage in terms of distribution networks and understanding regional consumer preferences. A focus on premium
product quality, sustainability, and effective marketing will be key to success in this evolving market.
Popular
maca brands in Asia include the Maca Team, who is known for its organic maca powder, capsules, and energy drinks sourced from Peru; Maca-Root,
who emphasizes energy and stamina benefits with a loyal customer base across Japan and China; Navitas Organics, who is a leading organic
superfoods brand offering maca powder in Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia; Sunfood Superfoods, who specializes in high-quality,
raw maca products across South Korea and Singapore; Sambazon, who integrates maca into energy drinks with other functional ingredients
like acai and green tea, available in Japan and Hong Kong; and FGO, who is a premium brand of organic maca powder available in Japan,
Hong Kong, and Taiwan, targeting fitness and wellness consumers. These brands compete in a rapidly growing market driven by the increasing
demand for natural, functional products in Asia.
12
Our
competitive strengths
We
believe that the following strengths contribute to our success:
●
Premium
Product Quality: Our maca products are sourced from the highest-quality farms in Yunnan, China, where the unique environmental
conditions maximize the potency and purity of the maca root. We ensure consistency and reliability in every batch through rigorous
testing and quality control processes, which results in a premium product that consumers can trust. Our commitment to quality allows
us to stand out in the marketplace and build long-term customer loyalty.
●
Sustainability
and Fair Trade: We are deeply committed to sustainability and ethical sourcing practices. We work directly with local maca suppliers
in China to support responsible farming techniques that protect the environment and promote the long-term viability of maca cultivation.
In addition, we ensure that fair wages and equitable compensation are provided to all the farmers and cooperatives in our supply
chain. Our sustainable approach not only benefits the environment but also strengthens our reputation as a socially responsible brand.
●
Strong
Brand Recognition: Our brand is built on the pillars of transparency, integrity, and customer satisfaction, which has resulted
in consistently positive reviews, high repurchase rates, and a loyal customer base. Through strategic branding efforts and word-of-mouth
marketing, we aim to establish ourselves as a leader in the maca product category in Asia.
●
Innovative
Product Offerings: Our diverse and innovative product portfolio is designed to meet the evolving needs and preferences of modern
consumers. In addition to traditional maca powders, we offer Maca-Noni, Maca Peptide Coffee and Maca Wine that cater to various lifestyle
choices and health goals. We continually invest in research and development to identify new applications for maca and expand our
product line to address emerging consumer trends, such as plant-based nutrition and natural wellness solutions. This adaptability
allows us to stay ahead of competitors and reach a broad customer demographic.
●
Experienced
Management Team: Our leadership team brings together a wealth of experience in retail,
marketing, e-commerce, and business management. This diverse expertise enables us to effectively
navigate complex markets, make informed decisions, and scale our operations efficiently.
Our team has a proven track record of launching successful marketing campaigns, optimizing
sales channels, and driving customer engagement, positioning us to achieve both short-term
and long-term business objectives.
●
Effective
Digital Marketing and Customer Engagement: One of our key strengths lies in our ability to leverage digital marketing strategies
to reach a wide audience and drive brand awareness. Through targeted social media campaigns, sport champion partnerships, and content
marketing, we create engaging and informative content that educates consumers about the benefits of maca and builds trust in our
brand. Our e-commerce platforms are optimized for user experience, making it easy for customers to browse, purchase, and interact
with our brand online. Additionally, our data-driven approach allows us to continuously refine our marketing strategies to maximize
customer acquisition, retention, and lifetime value.
13
Our
business strategy
We
intend to achieve our mission and further grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
●
Expanding
Product Offerings: As part of our ongoing commitment to innovation and meeting evolving consumer demands, we plan to continue
developing a diverse range of maca-based products. This includes introducing new product lines such as Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni,
Maca Wine, Maca Purified Powder, and other functional food and beverage items. By expanding our offerings, we aim to tap into various
consumer segments, including those seeking energy-boosting products, plant-based nutrition, and wellness solutions. This broad product
portfolio will allow us to diversify our revenue streams and enhance our market penetration, positioning us as a leader in the maca
product category.
●
Geographic
Expansion: In line with our growth strategy, we aim to increase our global presence, particularly in international markets where
the demand for natural health products is growing rapidly. Our focus will be on expanding within Asia, especially in countries like
China and Southeast Asia, where there is a rising interest in plant-based, wellness-oriented foods and beverages. Additionally, we
will explore opportunities in North America and Europe, leveraging the increasing consumer shift toward natural and functional ingredients.
By strategically entering these markets, we will establish a strong global footprint, catering to consumers seeking alternative,
natural solutions for their health and energy needs. Our geographic expansion will be supported by thorough market research, localized
marketing efforts, and strategic partnerships with regional distributors and retailers.
●
Enhancing
Brand Awareness: Building on our existing reputation, we will significantly increase our marketing efforts to boost brand recognition
across all markets. Our strategy will focus heavily on digital marketing initiatives, including targeted online advertising, to engage
potential customers at every touchpoint. We also partner with social media influencers and sport champions, to promote our products
and showcase their benefits to a larger audience. We will also invest in content marketing, creating valuable educational materials
that highlight the health benefits of maca, thus driving consumer awareness and trust. Our overall marketing approach will aim to
create a strong emotional connection with consumers, turning them into long-term loyal customers.
●
Strengthening
Distribution Channels: To expand our reach and ensure product availability, we will continue to strengthen and diversify our
distribution channels. We will focus on growing our e-commerce platform, optimizing the user experience. Additionally, we will increase
partnerships with both large and small retailers, expanding our presence in grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machines.
We will also explore opportunities with international distributors and retailers to increase our product’s visibility in new
markets. Through effective supply chain management and collaboration with logistics partners, we will ensure that our products are
delivered efficiently and meet the growing demand in different regions. We aim to create a seamless, omnichannel shopping experience
for consumers, enabling them to purchase our products both online and in-store.
Risks
Associated with Our Business and History of Losses
We
have incurred net losses since we commenced operations as CIMG Inc. in 2013, including net losses of $8.56 million and $8.75 million
for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was approximately $81.93
million. We expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses prior to recording sufficient revenue from our operations
to offset existing expenses. In the United States, we expect to incur additional losses as a result of the costs associated with operating
as an exchange-listed public company.
Recent
Developments
Since
July 2024, CIMG has been undergoing a transformation in digital marketing, distribution, and sales. As part of this transformation, we
have extended our sales and distribution network to include maca-infused food and beverages, reaffirming our commitment to reshaping
the online marketing, sales, and distribution landscape for consumer products.
CIMG
has successfully secured the exclusive distribution and sales rights for all maca products produced by Jiangsu Kangduoyuan Beverage Co.,
Ltd., a leading maca production base in Asia. These products include Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Wine, Maca Purified Powder,
and other full-range offerings. Through a comprehensive digital marketing strategy, CIMG is optimistic in its ability to achieve sales
growth and enhance the Company’s enterprise value.
CIMG’s
PRC subsidiary, Beijing Zhongyan, has signed contracts with multiple PRC-based distribution companies, including Guangdong Jixinsheng
Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai Qingshuteng Trading Co., Ltd., Sichuan Haohua Dinghui Trading Co., Ltd., and Shanghai Jinxianfang Trading
Co., Ltd. The Company aims to place Maca-Noni drinks gradually to a significant number of retail stores with the help of these distribution
companies, targeting within the next three years at selling and distributing Maca-Noni at 25,000 convenience stores of uSmile PetroChina,
400 convenience stores of Guangdong Petroleum Co., Ltd, 129 convenience stores at Chengdu Energy Gas Stations in Sichuan Province, and
no fewer than 300 self-service vending machines within the next 12 months.

were incorporated in 2011 in Nevada as Havana Furnishings, Inc. NuZee Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 2011. NuZee Co. Ltd. merged into
Havana Furnishings, Inc. in 2013, at which time we changed our name to NuZee, Inc. In June 2020, our common stock commenced trading
on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “NUZE.” Prior to that, our Common Stock was quoted on the OTCQB
Marketplace under the same symbol. We changed our name to CIMG Inc. and our ticker symbol from “NUZE” to
“IMG” effective October 31, 2024. Our principal executive and administrative offices are located at Room R2, FTY D,

The
Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ on January 23, 2024 (the “NASDAQ Notification Letter”), indicating that
the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). The
NASDAQ Notification Letter stated that the Company failed to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued
listing, as required by the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement.
Subsequently,
the Company completed a convertible note financing of $320,000 on April 27, 2024, an equity financing of $1,500,000 on June 4, 2024,
and an equity financing of $3,000,000 on July 11, 2024. On July 23, 2024, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ stating that based
on the Company’s Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on July 19, 2024, NASDAQ has determined that the Company has complied with
Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).
On
January 14, 2025, the Company received a notification letter (the “Minimum Bid Price Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications
Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for
continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain
a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement
exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Minimum Bid Price Notice has no immediate effect
on the listing of the Company’s Common Stock, which continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “IMG.”
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Notice,
or until July 14, 2025, to regain compliance. If at any time before July 14, 2025 the closing bid price of the Common Stock closes at
or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide written notification that the Company has
achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter will be resolved. If the Company does not regain compliance
during the compliance period ending July 14, 2025, then NASDAQ may in its discretion determine to grant the Company an additional 180
calendar day period to regain compliance, provided that the Company on July 14, 2025 meets the continued listing requirement for market
value of publicly held shares and all other applicable initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of
the minimum bid price requirement, and will need to provide NASDAQ written notice of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second
compliance period.
16
On
January 17, 2025, the Company received another notice (the “Annual Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company
is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ended September 30, 2024 with the SEC. The Annual Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s
stock on Nasdaq, and it states that the Company is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
within 60 calendar days from the date of the Annual Report Notice. If the plan is accepted by Nasdaq, then Nasdaq can grant the Company
up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 to regain compliance. In determining
whether to accept such plan, Nasdaq will consider such things as the likelihood that the remedial filing, along with any subsequent periodic
filing that will be due, can be made within the 180 day period, the Company’s past compliance history, the reasons for the late
filing, other corporate events that may occur within our review period, the Company’s overall financial condition and its public
disclosures. Any subsequent periodic filing that is due within the 180-day exception period must be filed no later than the end of the
period.
On
February 19, 2025, the Company received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024 with the SEC.
We
have submitted a Nasdaq compliance plan to Nasdaq on March 18, 2025 and Nasdaq grant the Company extension to (i) file the Form 10-K
for the period ended September 30, 2024 on or before June 13, 2025; and (ii) file the Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024
on or before July 14, 2025.
On
May 19, 2025, the Company received a notice (the “Quarterly Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company was not
in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2025 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Quarterly Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing
of the Company’s stock on Nasdaq.
As
a result of this additional delinquency of the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025, the Company submitted an update to its
original plan to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirement on June 3, 2025.
On June 13, 2025, the Company
did not manage to file its Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 and received a delist determination letter from the Listing
Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on June 27, 2025 (“Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter”). According
to the Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter, unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination by July 7, 2025, trading of the
Company’s common stock will be suspended from The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on July 9, 2025, and NSADAQ will
file a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
The Company intends to file
its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 as soon as possible, and in any event before July 7, 2025. In addition, the
Company intends to appeal Nasdaq’s delist determination and plans to request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel to present
its plan for regaining compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules by 4:00 Eastern Time on July 7, 2025.

Risk
Factor Summary
The
risk factors summarized below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects
and/or cause the price of our Common Stock to decline. These risks are discussed more fully in the section titled “Risk Factors.”
Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements
●
We
have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses in the future and we may never generate sufficient revenue
to achieve or sustain profitability. (see page 23)
●
We
expect to need to obtain additional capital to fund our existing operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may
be unable to continue to operate as a going concern. (see page 23)
●
We
have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and to forecast our future performance.
(see page 24)
●
Our
ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. (see page

Risks
Related to Our Business
●
Continued
innovation and the successful development and timely launch of new products are critical to our financial results and the achievement
of our growth strategy. (see page 25)
●
Our
future financial results are difficult to predict, and failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance or any publicly
announced guidance may cause the price of our stock to decline. (see page 25)
●
Increased
competition, including as a result of industry consolidation, could hurt our businesses, and changes in the coffee, tea and beverage
environment and retail landscape could impact our financial results. (see page 26)
●
Our
business, growth and profitability depend on the performance of third-parties and our relationship with them, including third-party
maca product providers. (see page 27)

Interruption
or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network, including a disruption in operations at any of our facilities, could affect
our ability to distribute products and could adversely affect our business and sales. (see page 27)
●
The
loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could have a material
adverse effect on our business. (see page 28)
●
Because
our management structure is not centralized, the management of our business operations may be more expensive and more difficult.
(see page 28)
●
We
may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. (see page
28)
●
Any
failure by us to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, or to quickly adjust to forecast changes, could adversely
affect our business and financial results. (see page 29)
●
We
may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products,
which would harm our competitive position. Additionally, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may
be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations. (see page 29)

Failure
to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results. (see page 30)

(see page 47)
In
addition to the other information set forth in this Report and other filings we have made and make in the future with the SEC, you should
carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations in future periods. Additional risks are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
22
Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements
We
have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses in the future.
We
have incurred net losses since our inception in 2013, including net losses of $8.56 million and $8.75 million for the years ended September
30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was approximately $81.93 million. We expect to incur
significant sales and marketing expenses, as well as costs associated with operating as an exchange-listed public company, prior to recording
sufficient revenue from our operations to offset these expenses.
These
losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity. Our
ability to become and remain profitable will depend on our ability to generate significantly higher revenues from the sales of our single-service
coffee products, Maca series products, etc., which depends upon a number of factors, including but
not limited to successful sales, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products and services.
Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable,
and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a
quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then sustain profitability would have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition.
Our
independent auditor’s report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and absent additional financing we may be unable to remain a going concern.
Considering
our current cash resources and our current and expected levels of operating expenses for the next twelve months, we expect to need additional
capital to fund our planned operations for at least twelve months. This evaluation is based on relevant conditions and events that are
currently known or reasonably foreseeable. A reduction in consumer demand for, or revenues from the sale of, our maca related products
could further constrain our cash resources.
We
intend to seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings. However, we may not be able raise such additional
capital on favorable terms or at all. If we are unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating
expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We
may also consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments or acquisitions, to
take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to:
●
fund
development of our products;
●
acquire,
license or invest in technologies or intellectual property relating to our existing products;
●
acquire
or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and
●
finance
capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.
23
Our
present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
success
of our current marketing efforts;
●
our
revenue growth rate and ability to generate cash flows from sales of our products;
●
effects
of competing technological and market developments; and
●
changes
in regulatory oversight applicable to our products.
The
various alternatives for raising additional capital include short-term or long-term debt financings, equity offerings, collaborations
or licensing arrangements and each one carries potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will
be further diluted. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges
senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could
impose significant restrictions on our operations or our ability to issue additional equity securities or issue additional indebtedness.
We
may also be required under additional debt financing to grant security interests on our assets, including our intellectual property.
If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our intellectual
property, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us which could lower the economic value of those items to us.
The
credit markets and the financial services industry have in the past experienced turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy,
failure, collapse, or sale of various financial institutions and intervention from the U.S. federal government. Furthermore, the capital
markets and the financial services industry are currently and expected to continue to be unpredictable and volatile. These events typically
make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. Accordingly, additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable
terms, if at all. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, including due to changes in our business plan, a lower demand for
our products or other risks described in this Report, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more sales and marketing
initiatives and development programs, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business.
We
have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and to forecast our future performance.
We
have little operating history and are addressing an emerging market. As a result, our current and future business prospects are difficult
to evaluate. All potential investors must consider our business prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we have encountered
and will continue to encounter as a company operating in a rapidly evolving market. Some of these risks relate to our potential inability
to:
●
effectively
manage our business and proprietary information;
●
recruit
and retain sales and marketing, technical and managerial personnel;
●
recruit
and retain appropriate distributor relationships;
●
successfully
develop and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
●
successfully
provide high quality products as our business expands; and
●
successfully
address other risks, as described in this Report or otherwise.
If
we do not address these risks successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Our
ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted in 2017, limited the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in periods
beginning after 2017 to eighty-percent of taxable income in the period to which the losses are carried. The TCJA also extended the expiration
period for net operating losses arising in periods after 2017 from 20 years to an unlimited period.
However,
the taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards was eliminated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic
Security Act (the “CARES” Act) for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. We may not be able to utilize our existing
net operating losses or any portion thereof in the current tax year or any available carryforward period.
24
In
addition, Section 382 may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to annual
limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and certain other tax attributes to offset
future taxable income or reduce taxes. Our past issuance of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in one or
more ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs may be subject to limitations
under Section 382. State NOL carryforwards may be similarly limited. Furthermore, transactions in our stock that have occurred in the
past and could occur in the future may trigger another ownership change pursuant to Section 382. Because of the cost and complexity involved
in the analysis of a Section 382 ownership change and the fact that we do not have any taxable income to offset, we have not undertaken
a study to assess whether an “ownership change” has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since
we became a “loss corporation” as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership could result in ownership
changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Finally, our ability to use NOLs of companies
that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability, we may not be able
to use a material portion of our NOLs, and this could reduce our earnings and potentially affect the valuation of our stock.
Risks
Related to Our Business
Continued
innovation and the successful development and timely launch of new products are critical to our financial results and the achievement
of our growth strategy.
Our
primary focus is on developing maca-based products for the Asian market, targeting consumers for use at home, in the office, and in other
everyday settings. Our future success depends, largely, on our ability to implement these and our other growth strategies effectively.
However, the achievement of our growth strategy is dependent, among other things, on our ability to extend the product offerings of our
existing brands and introduce innovative new. Although we devote significant focus to the development of new products, including Maca
Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Wine, Maca Purified Powder, we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new
products may not be commercially successful. Additionally, our new product introductions are often time sensitive, and thus failure to
deliver innovations on schedule could be detrimental to our ability to successfully launch such new products and retain partners, in
addition to potentially harming our reputation and customer loyalty. If we fail to implement our growth strategies or if we invest resources
in growth strategies that ultimately prove unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be negatively affected, which would materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results and our ability to maintain or
improve our competitive position will depend on our ability to effectively gauge the direction of our key marketplaces and successfully
identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products and co-packing services in these changing marketplaces.
Our
future financial results are difficult to predict, and failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance or any publicly
announced guidance may cause the price of our stock to decline.
As
we and our industry evolve, we expect to face new challenges with respect to our introduction of innovative products and the changing
competitive landscape within the maca products industry. These challenges can occur at various stages, including design, supply chain
and sales cycle. Any public forecasts regarding the expected performance of our business and future operating results are forward-looking
statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the SEC and in our
other public statements, and necessarily reflect current assumptions and judgments that may prove incorrect. As a result, there can be
no assurance that our performance will be consistent with any public forecasts or that any variation from such forecasts will not be
material and adverse. Failure to meet expectations, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, operating cash
flows and net revenues may result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the price of our stock. In addition, broad price and volume
fluctuations in the stock market as a whole, as well as general economic, business and political conditions, may adversely affect the
price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
25
Our
international sales and operations subject us to various additional legal, regulatory, financial and other risks.
We
have a manufacturing and sales office in Hong Kong. We operate globally and are attempting to develop products in multiple countries.
Consequently, we face complex legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, which may expose us to certain financial and
other risks. International operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:
●
foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations;
●
greater
difficulty in overseeing foreign operations;
●
logistical
and communications challenges;
●
potential
adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including export license requirements, trade barriers, tariffs and tax laws;
●
burdens
and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;
●
political
and economic instability;
●
foreign
tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;
●
greater
difficulty in protecting intellectual property;
●
the
risk of third-party disputes over ownership of intellectual property and infringement of third-party intellectual property by our
products; and
●
general
social, economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.
Increased
competition, including as a result of industry consolidation, could hurt our businesses.
The
maca products industry is intensely competitive and we compete with respect to product, quality, convenience, technology, innovation,
and price. We face significant competition in each of our channels and marketplaces. We compete with major international maca products
companies that operate in multiple geographic areas, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as
numerous companies that are primarily local in operation. Our Maca Series products also compete against local or regional brands as well
as against private label brands developed by retailers. Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the global marketplace or in
various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions
by competitors, including as a result of increased consolidation in the maca products industry.
26
Changes
in the maca products environment and retail landscape could impact our financial results.
The
maca products environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences; shifting consumer
tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, the maca products retail
landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving, not only in emerging and developing marketplaces, where modern trade is growing at a faster
pace than traditional trade outlets, but also in developed marketplaces, where discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of
transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment
and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.
Our
business, growth and profitability depend on the performance of third-parties and our relationship with them.
In
connection with the distribution of maca products, we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturing partners to provide high quality
maca products. We also rely on our manufacturing partners to provide us with additional manufacturing and facilitate distribution efforts
throughout China. Our reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturing partners subjects us to additional risks, including the possible
termination of the arrangement by a third-party suppliers or manufacturing partner at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Our
third-party suppliers and manufacturing partners are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks
that are out of our control. If any of these third-party suppliers or manufacturing partners fail to perform as required, this could
cause delays in our receipt of the maca products or otherwise adversely affect our business.
In
addition, a significant portion of our distribution network, and correspondingly our success in distributing our maca products, depends
on the performance of third-parties. Any non-performance or deficient performance by such parties may undermine our operations and profitability.
For distribution of our maca products, we typically rely on third party distribution networks, including freight companies and common
carriers. The success of these distribution networks depends on the performance of brokers, distributors, common carriers and retailers,
as well as our third-party manufacturing partners as it relates to distribution of certain of our products. There is a risk that a broker,
distributor, common carrier or retailer may refuse to or cease to market or carry our product, or that any such entity or our third-party
manufacturing partner may not adequately perform its functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute our products.
Furthermore,
such third-parties’ financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing
and sale activities. We must also maintain good commercial relationships with third-party brokers, distributors and retailers so that
they will promote and carry our product. Any adverse consequences resulting from the performance of third-parties or our relationship
with them could undermine our operations and profitability.
Interruption
or increased costs of our supply chain and sales network, including a disruption in operations at any of our facilities or our manufacturer
partners’ facilities, could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products and could adversely affect our business and
sales.
A
disruption in operations at any of our facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain or increase in prices relating to service
by our retailers, distributors, common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, or otherwise, whether as a result of
shipping costs and delays, trade restrictions, casualty, natural disaster, weather, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism,
labor shortages, contractual disputes, interruptions in port operations or highway arteries, pandemic, strikes, work stoppages, the financial
or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors and transportation providers, or other causes, could significantly impair our
ability to operate our business, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and impact our financial condition or results
of operations.
27
The
loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
Our
success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team. The individual and collective
efforts of our senior management team will be important as we continue to expand our commercial activities and develop additional products.
The loss or incapacity of existing members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
condition if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Our employment agreements with our executive officers are “at
will”, and the retention of our executive officers for any period of time cannot be guaranteed. We do not maintain “key person”
insurance on any of our employees.
Due
to the specialized nature of the business and our small size, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified
sales and marketing, technical and managerial personnel. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit
key sales, marketing, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to our development and could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring
additional expertise, such as sales and marketing, may require the addition of new management personnel, both domestic and international.
All of our employees may terminate their employment at any time with short or no advance notice. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting
or retaining qualified sales people. Recruiting and retention difficulties will limit our ability to support our development and sales
programs and to build a commercially viable business.
The
competition for talent is currently extremely high. In this competitive environment, our business could be adversely impacted by increases
in labor costs, including wages and benefits, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and
benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary
to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, and increased wages, and benefits and other costs. In addition,
our wages and benefits programs, combined with the periodic challenges in the labor market, may be insufficient to attract and retain
talent.
Because
our management structure is not centralized, the management of our business operations may be more expensive and more difficult.
As
part of our strategy to attract the most qualified individuals, we do not require the members of our management team to relocate to a
particular geographic area. Accordingly, the members of our management team are geographically dispersed. This decentralized structure
might cause additional expenses in the conduct of our business, and may also delay communication between members of our management team,
lower the quality of our management decisions or decrease our ability to take action quickly.
We
expect to continue to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure, and price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost
increases or may result in sales volume declines.
We
expect for the foreseeable future to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure. We may be able to pass some or all raw materials,
energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products;
however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are
not able to mitigate these inflationary pressures, such as by increasing our selling prices or reducing product sizes sufficiently to
offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including but not limited to packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee
benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial
condition.
We
may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.
While
we are currently a small company and, therefore, limited in our product development, marketing and sales activities, we anticipate continued
growth in our business operations commensurate with the expansion of our sales and support operations and distribution network and the
commercialization of our coffee products. Any future growth could impose significant added responsibilities on members of our existing
management and create strain on our organizational, administrative, and operational infrastructure, including sales and marketing, quality
control, and customer service. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial
and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, which in the past have been determined to be inadequate. Our
status as an exchange-listed public company will require us to increase our investment in financial accounting and reporting. If our
current infrastructure is unable to handle our growth, we may need to expand our infrastructure, to identify and recruit new staff and
to implement new reporting systems. The time and resources required to implement such expansion and systems could adversely affect our
operations. Our future financial performance and our ability to expand and market our single-serve coffee products and to compete effectively
will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.
28
Any
failure by us to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, or to quickly adjust to forecast changes, could adversely affect
our business and financial results.
There
is inherent risk in forecasting demand due to the uncertainties involved in assessing the current level of maturity of the single serve
component of our business as well as the current and future needs of our customers. We set target levels for the manufacture of our coffee
products and for the purchase of coffee in advance of customer orders based upon our forecasts of customer demand and those of our business
partners. If our forecasts exceed demand, we could experience excess inventory in the short-term, excess manufacturing capacity in the
short and long-term, and/or price decreases, all of which could impact our financial performance. Alternatively, if demand exceeds our
forecasts significantly beyond our current manufacturing capacity, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand, which could result
in a loss of share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our
products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income.
We
may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and
services, which would harm our competitive position.
Our
success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,
license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights over our products, procedures and services.
Other persons could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual properties without authorization or create intellectual properties
similar to ours independently. We may also pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in other jurisdictions,
including the United States. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights. Further, our competitors
may be able to independently develop similar intellectual property, duplicate our products and services or design around any intellectual
property rights we hold. Further, our intellectual property rights may be subject to termination or expirations. The loss of intellectual
property protections or the inability to timely regain intellectual property protections could harm our business and ability to compete.
We
may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.
We
cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks,
patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time subject to legal
proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others.
There
may be third-party intellectual property that is infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business. There could also
be existing patents or other intellectual property rights of which we are not aware that our products may inadvertently infringe. We
cannot assure you that holders of the relevant intellectual property rights purportedly relating to some aspect of our technology platform
or business, if any such holders exist, would not seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in the United States or
any other jurisdiction. We also cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective in completely preventing the infringement of trademarks,
patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. If we are found to have violated the intellectual
property rights of others, we may be subject to liability for our infringement activities or may be prohibited from using such intellectual
property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives of our own. In addition, we may incur significant expenses,
and may be forced to divert management’s time and other resources from our business and operations to defend against these third-party
infringement claims, regardless of their merits. Successful infringement or licensing claims made against us may result in significant
monetary liabilities and may materially disrupt our business and operations by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual
property in question.
29
Failure
to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results.
In
many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate
levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all
applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and
related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us,
we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign
tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment,
we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.
Risks
Associated With Doing Business in China
Changes
in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the
profitability of our business.
The
PRC’s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted
by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic
conditions within the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under
this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and
business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance
that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors:
changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources
of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Implementation of the negative list system. Although the
PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue
to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social
or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC’s political, economic and social environment.
The
approval and/or other requirements of the CSRC or other mainland China governmental authorities may be required in connection with our
issuance of securities overseas under mainland China rules, regulations or policies, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for
how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such other requirements.
The
Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, purport to require offshore
special purpose vehicles that are controlled by mainland China companies or individuals and that have been formed for the purpose of
seeking a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of mainland China domestic companies or assets to obtain
CSRC approval prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations
remain unclear. If CSRC approval is required, it is uncertain how long it will take for us to obtain such approval, and, even if we obtain
such CSRC approval, the approval could be rescinded. Any failure to obtain or a delay in obtaining CSRC approval for our future issuance
of securities overseas may subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC and other mainland China regulatory agencies, which could include
fines and penalties on our operations in mainland China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends outside of mainland
China, and other forms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Furthermore,
on July 6, 2021, the PRC government promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, or the July
6 Opinions, which, among other things, called for enhanced administration and supervision of overseas-listed mainland China-based companies,
proposed to strengthen the supervision of the overseas issuance and listing of shares by mainland China-based companies and clarified
the responsibilities of competent domestic industry regulators and government authorities. On December 28, 2021, the CAC, together with
other relevant administrative departments, jointly released the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022.
Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, network platform operators with personal information of over one million users shall apply
with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before going to list abroad.
30
The
new rules for the filing-based administration of overseas securities offerings and listings by Chinese domestic companies released on
February 17, 2023, or New Filing Rules, establish a new filing-based regime to regulate overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies.
According to the New Filing Rules, (i) an overseas offering and listing by a domestic company, whether directly or indirectly, shall
be filed with the CSRC; and (ii) the issuer or its affiliated domestic company, as the case may be, shall file with the CSRC for its
initial public offering, follow-on offering, issuance of convertible bonds, offshore relisting after go-private transactions and other
equivalent offing activities. In addition, after a domestic company has offered and listed securities in an overseas markets, it is required
to file a report to the CSRC after the occurrence and public disclosure of certain material corporate events, including but not limited
to change of control and voluntary or mandatory delisting. From March 31, 2023, enterprises that have been listed overseas shall constitute
existing enterprises and are not required to conduct the overseas listing filing procedure immediately, but shall carry out filing procedures
as required if they conduct future offshore offerings or capital raising activities or are involved in other circumstances that require
filing with the CSRC.
On
February 24, 2023, the CSRC, together with other relevant government authorities, issued the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality
and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Archives Rules, which became effective
on March 31, 2023. According to the Archives Rules, domestic mainland China companies, whether offering and listing securities overseas
directly or indirectly, must strictly abide the applicable laws and regulations when providing or publicly disclosing, either directly
or through their overseas listed entities, documents and materials to securities companies, securities services providers such as accounting
firms, or overseas regulators in the process of their overseas offering and listing. If such documents or materials contain any state
secrets or government authorities work secrets, domestic companies must obtain the approval from competent governmental authorities according
to the applicable laws, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level with the approving governmental authority.
Furthermore, the Archives Rules also provides that securities companies and securities service providers shall also fulfill the applicable
legal procedures when providing overseas regulatory institutions and other relevant institutions and individuals with documents or materials
containing any state secrets or government authorities work secrets or other documents or materials that, if divulged, will jeopardize
national security or public interest.
A
slowdown or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and our products.
Part
of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, there is no assurance that
this growth will continue. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments
in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our products and services.
If
relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.
At
various times during recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues.
Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries that may affect our economic outlook both in the United States and
in China. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business,
could reduce the price of our Common Stock.
Future
inflation in China may inhibit the profitability of our business in China.
In
recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead
to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our services and products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate
for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by Chinese
government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and
contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take
other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our services and products.
31
The
fluctuation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your investment.
The
change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, various factors, such as changes in China’s
political and economic conditions and China’s foreign exchange controls. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old
policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow
and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People’s Bank of China has decided to further implement
the reform of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such changes in policy have resulted in a
significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005. There remains significant international pressure on the
PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi
against the U.S. dollar. Any significant appreciation or revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on the value
of, and any dividends payable on, shares of our Common Stock in foreign currency terms. More specifically, if we decide to convert our
Renminbi into U.S. dollars, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount
available to us. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our 2018 offering into Renminbi for our operations,
appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion.
In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the exchange rate of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect
the price of shares of our Common Stock in U.S. dollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of
operations.
Restrictions
on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively.
Part
of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. As a result, restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated
in Renminbi to fund any business activities we may have outside China in the future or to make dividend payments to our shareholders
in U.S. dollars. Under current PRC laws and regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and
service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend distributions. However, Renminbi is not freely convertible for direct investment
or loans or investments in securities outside China, unless such use is approved by SAFE. For example, foreign exchange transactions
under the subsidiary’s capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain
subject to significant foreign exchange controls and the approval requirement of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to
convert Renminbi into foreign currency for capital expenditures. And the Chinese government is further strengthening the control of foreign
exchange; we will not be able to change the Chinese government’s decision in our own power.
Our
subsidiary in China is subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us.
CIMG
is a holding company and relies partially on dividends paid by its subsidiaries in China for our cash needs, including paying dividends
and other cash distributions to our shareholders to the extent we choose to do so, servicing any debt we may incur and paying our operating
expenses. Current PRC regulations permit the subsidiary in China to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if any,
determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Under the applicable requirements of PRC law, Beijing Zhongyan
may only distribute dividends after it has made allowances to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves are not distributable as
cash dividends. In addition, if the subsidiaries or affiliated entities in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments
governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any such restrictions may materially affect
such entities’ ability to make dividends or make payments, in service fees or otherwise, to us, which may materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
32
Uncertainties
with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.
The
PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law
system may be cited as reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, newly introduced PRC laws and regulations have significantly
enhanced the protections of interest relating to foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively
new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of such laws and regulations may not always be consistent,
and enforcement of these laws. In different administrative areas and regulations involves significant uncertainties, any of which could
limit the available legal protections. In addition, the PRC administrative and judicial authorities have significant discretion in interpreting,
implementing or enforcing statutory rules and contractual terms, and it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative
and judicial proceedings and the level of legal protection we may enjoy in the PRC than under some more developed legal systems. These
uncertainties may affect our decisions on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with PRC laws and regulations, and may affect
our ability to enforce our contractual or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited legal
actions or threats in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from us. Such uncertainties may therefore increase our operating expenses
and costs, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The
PRC’s legal and judicial system under special circumstances may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights
of foreign investors.
The
legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is uncertain. As a result, it may be impossible
to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, Different administrative regions have different legal and judicial interpretations
or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC’s legal system is based on the
civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes. A decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to
be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes.
The
promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign
investors. There can be no assurance that a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting
the PRC’s political, economic or social life, will not affect the PRC government’s ability to continue to support and pursue
these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.
Certain
PRC regulations, including the M&A Rules and national security regulations, may require a complicated review and approval process
which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.
The
M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign
investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of
a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition, certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated
with the same entities or individuals of the domestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing
Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in August
2011, require that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors in “any industry with national security concerns” be subject
to national security review by the MOFCOM. In addition, any activities attempting to circumvent such review process, including structuring
the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement, are strictly prohibited. There is significant uncertainty regarding
the interpretation and implementation of these regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities in China. In addition, complying
with these requirements could be time-consuming, and the required notification, review or approval process may materially delay or affect
our ability to complete merger and acquisition transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek growth through acquisitions may
be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained its approval for our entry into
contractual arrangements with the affiliated entities, we may be required to file for remedial approvals. There is no assurance that
we would be able to obtain such approval from the MOFCOM. We may also be subject to administrative fines or penalties by the MOFCOM that
may require us to limit our business operations in the PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance of our funds in foreign currencies
into the PRC or take other actions that could have material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
33
PRC
regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or
additional capital contributions to the PRC Subsidiaries and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund
and expand our business.
CIMG
is a Nevada corporation conducting part of its operations in China through its PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries. CIMG may make loans to
the Hong Kong PRC Subsidiaries subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or may make additional
capital contributions to subsidiaries in China.
Any
loans to the subsidiaries in China are subject to foreign investment and are under PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations.
For example, loans by us to the wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries or VIE entities in China to finance their activities must be registered
with the local counterpart of SAFE. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity
and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)
directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations;
(ii) directly or indirectly use for investment in securities or investments other than banks’ principal-secured products unless
otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly
permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except
for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other
things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments
in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and does not violate with the negative list
on foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry
this out in practice. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities
by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain
the necessary government approvals on a timely basis.
We
must remit offering proceeds to China in a future securities issuance before they may be used to benefit our business in China, the process
of which may be time-consuming, and we cannot assure that we can complete all necessary governmental registration processes in a timely
manner.
The
proceeds of a future offering may be remitted back to the PRC, and the process for wiring such proceeds back to the PRC may be time-consuming
after the closing of a future offering. We may be unable to use these proceeds to grow our business until the PRC Subsidiaries receive
such proceeds in the PRC. Any transfer of funds by us to the PRC Subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered
capital, are subject to approval by or registration or filing with relevant governmental authorities in China. Any foreign loans procured
by the PRC Subsidiaries is required to be registered with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”)
or its local branches or satisfy relevant requirements, and the PRC subsidiaries may not procure loans which exceed the difference between
their respective total project investment amount and registered capital or 2 times (which may be varied year by year due to the change
of PRC’s national macro-control policy) of the net worth of the PRC subsidiary. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested
enterprises in China, capital contributions to the PRC subsidiaries are subject to the approval of or filing with State Administration
for Market Regulation in its local branches, the Ministry of Commerce in its local branches and registration with a local bank authorized
by SAFE.
In
light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding
companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government
approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to the PRC subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions
by us to the PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to capitalize or otherwise
fund the PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to fund and
expand our business and our securities.
34
A
failure by the beneficial owners of our shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict
our ability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC
law.
SAFE
has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents’ Investment and Financing and
Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (or SAFE Circular No. 37), effective on July 4, 2014, and its appendices, that
require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct
establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’
legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37
as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant
changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer
or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle
fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit
distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose
vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the
various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.
These
regulations apply to our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers
that we make in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different
views and procedures on the application and implementation of SAFE regulations, and since SAFE Circular No. 37 was relatively new, there
remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. As of the date of this report, all PRC residents known to us that currently hold
direct or indirect interests in our company have completed the necessary registrations with SAFE as required by SAFE Circular 37. However,
we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor
can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with the requirements of SAFE Circular 37. However, we cannot assure you that these individuals
or any other direct or indirect shareholders or beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents will be able to successfully complete
the registration or update the registration of their direct and indirect equity interest as required in the future. If they fail to make
or update the registration, our shareholders could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and SAFE could restrict our cross-border
investment activities and our foreign exchange activities, including restricting the PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends
to, or obtain loans denominated in foreign currencies from, our company, or prevent us from paying dividends. As a result, our business
operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.
We
may be subject to fine due to our insufficient payment of the social insurance and housing fund of the employees.
Pursuant
to the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, as amended on December 29, 2018,and the Regulation on the Administration of Housing Accumulation
Funds, as amended on March 24, 2019, employers in China shall register with relevant social insurance agency and relevant housing provident
fund management center and open special housing provident fund accounts for each of their employees, and pay contributions to the social
insurance plan and the housing provident fund for their employees, such contribution amount payable shall be calculated based on the
employee’s actual salary in accordance with the relevant regulations. In case the employer fails to make sufficient payment of
the social insurance, it may be subject to fine up to 3 times of the insufficient amount and pay late fees. If the employer failed to
register with relevant housing provident fund management center or failed to open special housing provident fund accounts for the employees
within the ordered time limit, a fine of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000 may be imposed. In addition, if the employer
fails to pay sufficient contributions to housing provident fund as required, the housing provident fund management center shall order
it to make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit; where the payment has not been made after the expiration of the time
limit, the housing provident fund management center may request the people’s court for compulsory enforcement. On July 20, 2018,
the General Office of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Reform Plan on Tax
Collection and Administration Systems for Local Offices of the State Administration of Taxation and Local Taxation Bureaus, according
to which the collection and administration of social insurance will be transferred from the social insurance departments to competent
tax authorities, and the supervision over the payment of social insurance will be significantly strengthened in the way that an enterprise
must pay social insurance for its employees based on their overall salary at certain legally required rates. If we are fined due to insufficient
payment of the social insurance and housing fund of the employees, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.
35
You
may face difficulties in protecting your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder of ours since we conduct part of our operations
in China and part of our officers and directors reside in China.
We
conduct part of our operations in China through Beijing Zhongyan, our subsidiary in China. Part of our current officers and directors
reside outside the United States and part of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. Because of this, it
may be difficult for you to conduct due diligence on our company, our executive officers or directors and attend stockholder meetings
if the meetings are held in China. As a result, our public stockholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through
actions against our management, directors or major stockholders than would stockholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly
within the United States.
You
may experience difficulties in protecting your rights through the United States courts.
Currently,
part of our operations is conducted in China and part of our assets are located in China. Part our officers are nationals or residents
of the PRC and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a stockholder
to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United
States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any
state in the United States.
In
addition, it may be difficult or impossible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon us our directors and officers
in the event that you believe that your rights have been violated under United States securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful
in effecting service of process and bringing an action of this kind, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against
our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the PRC of judgments obtained in the United
States.
Increases
in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.
The
economy of China has been experiencing significant growth, leading to inflation and increased labor costs. China’s overall economy
and the average wage in the PRC are expected to continue to grow. Future increases in China’s inflation and material increases
in the cost of labor may materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.
Our
auditor is headquartered in Singapore and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. To the extent that our independent
registered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company become located in China,
the PCAOB may not be able inspect such audit documentation and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our
Common Stock could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and Accelerating Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
Our
independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in this report filed with
the SEC and will issue audit reports related to our company in the future. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United
States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections
by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor’s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject
to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities.
Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit
procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality.
On December 2, 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure
requirements in the HFCAA. We are required by the HFCAA to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. Pursuant to
the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate
completely certain named registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our independent registered
public accounting firm is headquartered in the Singapore and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis and as such, it is not
affected by or subject to the PCAOB’s Determination Report. To the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor’s
audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB, our Common Stock could
be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
36
Our
securities may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for two consecutive years. As a result,
an exchange may determine to delist our securities.
In
light of recent events indicating greater oversight by the CAC over data security, we may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other
obligations regarding cybersecurity and data protection, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business and our securities.
Since
2021, the Chinese government has strengthened its anti-monopoly supervision, mainly in three aspects: (1) establishing the National Anti-Monopoly
Bureau; (2) revising and promulgating anti-monopoly laws and regulations, including: the Anti-Monopoly Law (draft Amendment published
on October 23, 2021 for public opinions), the anti-monopoly guidelines for various industries, and the detailed Rules for the Implementation
of the Fair Competition Review System; and (3) expanding the anti-monopoly law enforcement targeting Internet companies and large enterprises.
As of the date of this report, the Chinese government’s recent statements and regulatory actions related to anti-monopoly concerns
have not impacted our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange because neither
the Company nor its PRC operating entities engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions.
On
November 14, 2021, the CAC released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), or the Data Security
Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has not been promulgated as of the
date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding more than one million users/users’
individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data processing activities refers to activities
such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. According to the latest
amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022, an online
platform operator holding more than one million users/users’ individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before
listing abroad.
As
of the date of this report, CIMG and its subsidiaries have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries
to go through cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that CIMG and its subsidiaries do not possess personal
data of at least one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security in their business
operations as of the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users’ personal information
or data that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Cybersecurity
Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including
the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures
and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect,
we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee,
however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in the future, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.
Compliance
with China’s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review (revised draft for public consultation), Personal Information
Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other
future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.
China
has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China’s
new Data Security Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China in June 2021, or the Data
Security Law, will take effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted
based on “data classification and hierarchical protection system” for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities
in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by
the Chinese government. As the Data Security Law has not yet come into effect, we may need to make adjustments to our data processing
practices to comply with this law.
37
Additionally,
China’s Cyber Security Law, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other
necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides
that China adopt a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security
protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being
disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and
the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity’s information and network systems
belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to the Measures for the Graded Protection and the Guidelines for Grading
of Classified Protection of Cyber Security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities
must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination
and approval.
Recently,
the Cyberspace Administration of China has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public
offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information
of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber
Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at “preventing national data security risks, maintaining
national security and safeguarding public interests.” On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised
draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal
information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.
It
is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect
they will have on the life sciences sector generally and the Company in particular. China’s regulators may impose penalties for
non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.
In
addition, our securities may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for two consecutive
years.
Also,
on August 20, 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which will be implemented on
November 1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal
information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations
and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes
of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical
information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold
to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China,
and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly,
the draft contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior
year.
Interpretation,
application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through
new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security
Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or
even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in
the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection
and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed
on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with
such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security
that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation
that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties
from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private
claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even
if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation
and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by
the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to
raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market.
38
On
November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for
Comments), or the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has
not been promulgated as of the date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding
more than one million users/users’ individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data
processing activities refers to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or
deletion of data. According to the latest amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became
effective on February 15, 2022, an online platform operator holding more than one million users/users’ individual information shall
be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad.
As
of the date of this report, CIMG and its subsidiaries have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries
to go through cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that the PRC subsidiaries do not possess personal
data of at least one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security in their business
operations as of the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users’ personal information
or data that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Cybersecurity
Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including
the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures
and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect,
we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee,
however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in the future, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.
Failure
to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely affect our business.
We
are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in
bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including
some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent
practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment
from personnel of other companies or government agencies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government
officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.
We
have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China. Companies with operations in China have been accused and found
guilty of sales practices that involve unlawful activity, including violations of the FCPA. We believe to date we have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of the FCPA. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less
than effective, and the employees, consultants and/or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively
affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor
liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.

Risks
Related to Ownership of our Common Stock
The
market price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
The
trading price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some
of which we cannot control. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Report,
these factors include but are not limited to:
●
the
success of, or developments in, competitive products, services or technologies;
●
regulatory
actions with respect to our products and our competitors;
●
the
level of success of our marketing strategy;
●
announcements
by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;
●
regulatory
or legal developments in the United States and other countries;
●
recruitment
or departure of key personnel;
●
expenses
related to any of our development programs and our business in general;
●
actual
or anticipated changes in financial estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;
●
failure
to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;
●
variations
in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
●
fluctuations
in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;
●
share
price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;
●
our
ability or failure to raise additional capital in equity or debt transactions;
●
costs
associated with our sales and marketing initiatives;
●
sales
of our Common Stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and
●
general
economic, business, industry, market and political conditions, including prevailing interest rates and the rate of inflation.
In
addition, the stock market in general has in the past experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated
or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the
market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of
a broad range of other risks, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, could have a dramatic and material
adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock.
Despite
our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock will be sustained.
In
June 2020, our Common Stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “NUZE.” On October 31, 2024,
we changed our symbol to “IMG.” Although our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, an active trading market
for our shares may never be sustained. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of
our securities is not active. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our securities
and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using shares of our securities as
consideration, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The
Nasdaq Capital Market may subsequently delist our securities if we fail to comply with ongoing listing standards.
The
Nasdaq Capital Market’s rules for listed companies requires us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity
standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our Common Stock. In addition to specific listing and maintenance standards,
the Nasdaq Capital Market has broad discretionary authority over the continued listing of securities, which it could exercise with respect
to the listing of our Common Stock.
40
As
a listed company, we are required to meet the continued listing requirements applicable to all Nasdaq Capital Market companies. On September
20, 2022, the Company received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”)
indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
for continued listing (the “Bid Price Rule”). On December 28, 2022, the Company completed a 1-for-35 reverse stock split,
which became effective on December 28, 2022. On January 17, 2023, the Company received notice that the Company had regained compliance
with the Bid Price Rule. In addition to the Bid Price Rule previously described, Nasdaq Capital Market listing rules require us to maintain
a minimum stockholders’ equity of $2.5 million under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), a minimum market value of listed securities
of $35 million under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), or a minimum net income of $500,000 under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(3).
The
Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ on January 23, 2024 (the “NASDAQ Notification Letter”), indicating that
the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). The
NASDAQ Notification Letter stated that the Company failed to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued
listing, as required by the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement. Subsequently, the Company completed a convertible note financing
of $320,000 on April 27, 2024, an equity financing of $1,500,000 on June 4, 2024, and an equity financing of $3,000,000 on July 11, 2024.
On July 23, 2024, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ stating that based on the Company’s Form 8-K, filed with the Commission
on July 19, 2024, NASDAQ has determined that the Company has complied with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).
On
January 14, 2025, the Company received a notification letter (the “Minimum Bid Price Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications
Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for
continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain
a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement
exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Minimum Bid Price Notice has no immediate effect
on the listing of the Company’s Common Stock, which continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “IMG.”
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Notice,
or until July 14, 2025, to regain compliance. If at any time before July 14, 2025 the closing bid price of the Common Stock closes at
or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide written notification that the Company has
achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter will be resolved. If the Company does not regain compliance
during the compliance period ending July 14, 2025, then NASDAQ may in its discretion determine to grant the Company an additional 180
calendar day period to regain compliance, provided that the Company on July 14, 2025 meets the continued listing requirement for market
value of publicly held shares and all other applicable initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of
the minimum bid price requirement, and will need to provide NASDAQ written notice of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second
compliance period.
On
January 17, 2025, the Company received another notice (the “Annual Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company
is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ended September 30, 2024 with the SEC. The Annual Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s
stock on Nasdaq, and it states that the Company is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
within 60 calendar days from the date of the Annual Report Notice. If the plan is accepted by Nasdaq, then Nasdaq can grant the Company
up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 to regain compliance. In determining
whether to accept such plan, Nasdaq will consider such things as the likelihood that the remedial filing, along with any subsequent periodic
filing that will be due, can be made within the 180 day period, the Company’s past compliance history, the reasons for the late
filing, other corporate events that may occur within our review period, the Company’s overall financial condition and its public
disclosures. Any subsequent periodic filing that is due within the 180 day exception period must be filed no later than the end of the
period.
On
February 19, 2025, the Company received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024 with the SEC.
41
We have submitted a Nasdaq compliance plan to Nasdaq on March 18, 2025
and Nasdaq grant the Company extension to (i) file the Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2024 on or before June 13, 2025; and
(ii) file the Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024 on or before July 14, 2025.
On
May 19, 2025, the Company received a notice (the “Quarterly Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company was not
in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2025 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Quarterly Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing
of the Company’s stock on Nasdaq.
As a result of this additional delinquency of the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025, the Company submitted an update to its
original plan to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirement on June 3, 2025.
On June 13, 2025, the Company
did not manage to file its Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 and received a delist determination letter from the Listing
Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on June 27, 2025 (“Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter”). According
to the Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter, unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination by July 7, 2025, trading of the
Company’s common stock will be suspended from The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on July 9, 2025, and NSADAQ will
file a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
The Company intends to file
its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 as soon as possible, and in any event before July 7, 2025. In addition, the
Company intends to appeal Nasdaq’s delist determination and plans to request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel to present
its plan for regaining compliance with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules by 4:00 Eastern Time on July 7, 2025.
If
the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period or periods, including any extensions that NASDAQ may determine
to grant, NASDAQ will provide notice that the Common Stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal
that determination to a NASDAQ hearings panel. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the minimum bid
price requirement during the 180-day compliance period, secure a second period of 180 days to regain compliance or maintain compliance
with the other NASDAQ listing requirements.
If
we fail to meet one of those standards or any other Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirement, our Common Stock may be subject
to delisting, as applied by Nasdaq in its discretion. We intend to take all commercially reasonable actions to maintain our Nasdaq Capital
Market listing. If our Common Stock is delisted in the future, it is not likely that we will be able to list our Common Stock on another
national securities exchange on a timely basis or at all and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter
market; however, if this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability
of market quotations for our Common Stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, in the event of such
delisting, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.
We
have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our recent offering and may not use them effectively, which could affect our
results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.
Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our recent offering. We intend to use the net proceeds
from the offering to acquire complementary businesses, acquire or license products or technologies that are complementary to our own,
although we have no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any such use of proceeds for acquisitions or licenses, and
for working capital and general corporate purposes. As a result, you will be relying upon management’s judgment with only limited
information about our specific intentions for the use of the balance of the net proceeds of the offering. You will not have the opportunity,
as part of your investment decision, to assess whether we are using the proceeds appropriately. Our management might not apply our net
proceeds in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. If we do not invest or apply the net proceeds from the offering
in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.
We
incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management must devote substantial time to compliance initiatives
as a result of the listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
As
a listed company, we are required to meet the continued listing requirements applicable to all NASDAQ Capital Market companies. We expect
our ongoing compliance with such rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make
some activities more time-consuming and costly. These requirements may divert the attention of our management and personnel from other
business concerns, and they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The
increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business
or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive
for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar
coverage. We cannot accurately predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements.
The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board,
our Board committees or as executive officers.
42
We
expect to incur significant costs and devote substantial management time to maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting, and regardless we may be unable to prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud or to accurately and
timely report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner.
As
a publicly traded company, our management is required to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our
management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible
remediation.
We
designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures,
no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met.
These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.
Because
of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We cannot assure
you that the measures we have taken will be effective in mitigating or preventing significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting in the future.
If
we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company,
including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or to report them
within the timeframes required by law or exchange regulations.
Additionally,
we have engaged only a very limited number of accounting and finance personnel and we rely in part on outside consultants. We may need
to incur additional expenses to hire additional personnel with public company financial reporting expertise to build our financial management
and reporting infrastructure, and further develop and document our accounting policies and financial reporting procedures. In the event
we need to hire additional personnel with public company financial reporting expertise but we are unable to do so, we may not be able
to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence
in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.
If
we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our
financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.
Under
standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented, detected or corrected on a timely basis.
If
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future,
then there exists a risk that our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements that are unknown to us at that
time, and such misstatements could require us to restate our financial results. The existence of a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting may result in current and potential stockholders losing confidence in our financial reporting, which
could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock.
43
In
addition, the existence of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely
file periodic reports under the Exchange Act and may consequently result in the SEC revoking the registration of our Common Stock, or
the delisting of our Common Stock. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market price
of our Common Stock or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Anti-takeover
provisions in our third amended and restated bylaws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company
or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our securities.
Our
third amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition
deemed undesirable by our Board. Our third amended and restated bylaws include provisions:
●
limiting
the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors, including provisions that require the Company to advance payment
for defending pending or threatened claims;
●
controlling
the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings; and
●
limiting
the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our Board then in office.
In
addition, we are subject to anti-takeover laws for Nevada corporations. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging
in a business combination with any shareholder, including all affiliates and associates of the shareholder, who is the beneficial owner
of 10% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, for two years following the date that the shareholder first became
the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation’s voting stock, unless specified conditions are met. If those conditions
are not met, then after the expiration of the two-year period the corporation may not engage in a business combination with such shareholder
unless certain other conditions are met.
These
provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. The existence of the
foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They
could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for
their Common Stock in an acquisition.
We
have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently,
any profits from an investment in our Common Stock will depend on whether the price of our Common Stock increases.
We
have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any,
to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be our stockholders’
sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.
Claims
for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us
and may reduce the amount of money available to us.
Our
third amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted
by Nevada law. In addition, our third amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our
directors and officers provide for the following:
44
●
We
will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request,
to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. Nevada law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and,
with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful.
●
We
will also indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.
●
We
are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to any indemnitee in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such indemnitee
shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
●
The
rights conferred in our third amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized
to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents
and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.
General
Risk Factors
Product
safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.
Our
success depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. While we are
committed to the safety and quality of our products, we may not achieve our product safety and quality standards. Product safety or quality
issues, or mislabeling, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination or quality or safety issues, even when false or
unfounded, could subject us to product liability and consumer claims, negative publicity, a loss of consumer confidence and trust, may
require us from time to time to conduct costly recalls from some or all of the channels in which the affected product was distributed,
could damage the goodwill associated with our brands, and may cause consumers to choose other products. Such issues could result in the
destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, which could cause our business
to suffer and affect our results of operations.
If
equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our
Common Stock, the price of our Common Stock could decline.
The
trading market for our Common Stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and
our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our Common Stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade
our Common Stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.
We
may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
The
market price of our Common Stock has been, and may in the future be, volatile. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility
in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation, including but not limited to securities class action litigation.
We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and
divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial condition.
45
If
we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption or failure, misappropriation of data or breaches of security,
our operations could be disrupted, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation
may be damaged.
Our
business involves the collection, storage and transmission of personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our
customers and employees. Our information systems also contain the Company’s proprietary and other confidential information related
to our businesses. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may
also be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases
or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; server or cloud provider breaches; computer viruses; physical or
electronic break-ins; cyber-attacks; catastrophic events; or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other attempts to harm
our systems. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information
technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company,
its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable
or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable
to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in time. We could also experience a loss of critical data
and delays or interruptions in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions. Some of our commercial partners, such as those
that help us deliver our website, may receive or store information provided by us or our users through our websites. If these third parties
fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices, or fail to comply with our online policies, or in the event of a
breach of their networks, our users’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
If
our systems are harmed or fail to function properly, we may need to expend significant financial resources to repair or replace systems
or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If we experience a significant security
breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant security breach, we could be exposed to costly legal or regulatory
actions against us in connection with such incidents, which could result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business
practices. Any incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of user information, or incidents that are a violation of our
online privacy policy, could harm our brand reputation and diminish our competitive position. Any of these events could have a material
and adverse effect on our business, reputation or financial results. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate
to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.
Changes
in regulatory standards could adversely affect our business.
Our
business is subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements regarding distribution, production, labeling and
marketing. Changes to regulation of the maca products industry could include increased limitations on advertising and promotional activities
or other non-tariff measures that could adversely impact our business. In addition, we face government regulations pertaining to the
health and safety of our employees and our consumers as well as regulations addressing the impact of our business on the environment,
domestically as well as internationally. Compliance with these health, safety and environmental regulations may require us to alter our
manufacturing processes and our sourcing. Such actions could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition,
and our inability to effectively and timely comply with such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position.
Employment
litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.
Employees
may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, creation of a hostile work place, discrimination, wage and hour,
sexual harassment and other employment issues. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment
claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience,
these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Companies that have faced employment or harassment related lawsuits
have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their sales.
If we were to face any employment related claims, our business could be negatively affected.
46
Future
changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect reported
results of operations.
A
change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of
transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements
have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our
reported financial results or the way we conduct business.
Currently
pending, threatened or future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings or inquiries could result in material adverse consequences,
including judgments or settlements.
We
are, or may from time to time become, involved in lawsuits and other legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings or inquiries. See
“Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Annual Report for information regarding currently pending litigation that could
have a material impact on the Company. Many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties
and complexities, all of which make the matters costly to address. The timing of the final resolutions to any such lawsuits, inquiries,
and other legal proceedings is uncertain.
Additionally,
the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial
payments, adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any judgment against us, the
entry into any settlement agreement, or the imposition of any fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Future
acquisitions of and investments in new businesses could impact our business and financial condition.
From
time to time, we may acquire or invest in businesses or partnerships that we believe could complement our business. The pursuit of such
acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses, regardless of whether the
acquisition or investment is ultimately completed. In addition, acquisitions and investments may not perform as expected and we may be
unable to realize the expected benefits, synergies, or developments that we may initially anticipate. Further, if we are able to successfully
identify and acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel or operations, or effectively
manage the combined business following the acquisition, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.
In
addition, to the extent we finance any acquisition or investment in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase
price is paid with shares of our Common Stock, it could be dilutive to our current stockholders.
Ongoing
geopolitical tensions around the world may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We
may face risks associated with heightened tensions in geopolitical and economic relations. Rivalries and sanctions between major powers,
including the United States and China, and unrest, terrorist threats, wars and other conflicts involving Ukraine, the Middle East and
elsewhere have created increased global uncertainty. Such geopolitical tensions, along with trade disputes and regional conflicts, may
result in economic instability, market volatility, and regulatory changes, which could impact our supply chain, operations, and consumer
demand. Recently, the United States has proposed to impose multiple rounds of tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from multiple
countries, including China, and China has responded with retaliatory tariffs. Since February 2025, the U.S. administration has proposed
to increase the total tariff level for imported Chinese goods to 125%, and additional tariff increases could be imposed as the trade
tension between the two countries continues to heighten. On April 9, 2025, China responded by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to 84%
from 34%. On April 10, 2025, the U.S. imposed a 34% “reciprocal tariff” on top of existing levies, effectively raising the
minimum tariff on Chinese goods to 54%. On April 11, 2025, the U.S. announced that consumer electronics would be exempt from tariffs
imposed on most countries, but a 20% tariff would remain in place for electronics imported from China. Later that same day, in a further
retaliatory move, China increased tariffs on U.S. imports to 125%.
Historically,
tariffs have led to increased trade and political tensions, between the U.S. and China, as well as between the U.S. and other countries.
Political tensions as a result of trade policies could reduce trade volume, cross-border investment, technological exchange, and other
economic activities between major economies, resulting in a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of
global financial and stock markets. Moreover, the heightened geopolitical uncertainty and potential for further escalation may discourage
investments in securities issued by China-based companies (including us) and affect the global macroeconomic environment. For example,
it has been reported that the U.S. administration may consider imposing further restrictions or prohibitions on trading of Chinese securities.
Such geopolitical developments could materially and adversely affect our overall financial performance and prices of our Common Stock.
Furthermore,
such tensions may lead to consumer boycotts, increased security measures, and travel restrictions, all of which could negatively affect
our ability to conduct business, maintain supply chain operations, and expand into new markets. Any restrictions on international trade
and capital flows may have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and expand our operations. As a result, any of these events
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Maca Series products are exclusively
distributed in the Asian market, with raw materials, supply chains, and sales operations based in China. In contrast, DRIPKIT products
are sold solely in the U.S. market, with their raw materials, supply chains, and sales operations entirely within the United States.
As both product lines operate independently and do not involve cross-border trade, the Company is not directly affected by changes in
export tariffs or foreign import policies. Accordingly, as of the date of this report, ongoing geopolitical tensions have had a limited
impact on our business.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Steeped
Litigation
As
previously disclosed, on January 27, 2023, Steeped, Inc. d/b/a Steeped Coffee (“Steeped”) filed a complaint against the Company
in the Superior Court of California, Santa Cruz County (Case No. 23CV00234) (the “Complaint”). The Complaint related to Steeped’s
claim that the Company breached a 2021 settlement agreement that resolved Steeped’s 2019 trademark infringement case against the
Company. The earlier case involved Steeped’s purported trademark protection for “steeped coffee” and related phrases.
Steeped
alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,
and fraud in the inducement of contract. Plaintiff sought a trial by jury and relief in the form of a permanent injunction for use of
“Steep Coffee” or any confusingly similar variant of “STEEPED COFFEE”; the impoundment and destruction of allegedly
violating packaging materials and/or finished goods; a final judgment for all profits derived from the Company’s allegedly unlawful
conduct, actual damages, damages to the Steeped’s reputation and goodwill among its customers and partners; and reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs. The Company answered the Complaint with a general denial and asserted twenty-five affirmative defenses.
On
January 16, 2024, without a finding or admission of wrongdoing, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Steeped. In exchange
for mutual releases and a dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice, the Company paid Steeped $500,000. Steeped filed a Notice of Settlement
on January 30, 2024, and on April 18, 2024, the case was dismissed. On June 19, 2024, both parties officially signed the “SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE”, the Company paid Steeped $500,000.
Curtin
Litigation
As
previously disclosed, on January 6, 2023, a former employee of the Company, Rosalina Curtin filed a complaint against the Company and
another former employee of the Company, Jose Ramirez, in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego (Case No. 37-2023-00000841-CU-WT-NC)
(the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleged that Ms. Curtin was subject to harassment by Mr. Ramirez, gender discrimination
throughout her employment, that she reported this discrimination and harassment to the Company, and that the Company retaliated against
her and wrongfully terminated her for whistleblowing and failed to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Ms. Curtin sought
compensatory damages, including loss of past, present and future earnings, and benefits, as well as punitive damages, penalties, attorney’s
fees and costs and interest. Pursuant to the terms of Ms. Curtin’s Employment Agreement with the Company, on December 22, 2023,
the Court compelled the case to arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (Case Number 01-24-0002-3225).
48
On
November 8, 2024, without a finding or admission of wrongdoing, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Ms. Curtin. In exchange
for mutual general releases and a dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice, the Company paid Ms. Curtin $125,000. On December 6, 2024,
the case was dismissed in its entirety.
Kim
Litigation
On
October 3, 2024, Mr. Sooncha Kim filed a complaint against the Company in the Southern District of New York, (Case No. 1:24-cv-7485)
(the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleges that the Company breached a Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated
June 6, 2024, between the Company and Mr. Kim, by, among other things, failing to deliver the registration rights agreement, excluding
Mr. Kim from the S1 registration statement, delaying conversion of Mr. Kim’s notes, undertaking steps to dilute Mr. Kim’s
shares, failing to honor Mr. Kim’s 50% participation right in any subsequent financing and failing to appoint a designated director,
as set forth in the parties’ agreement. Mr. Kim seeks specific performance of the Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement,
and monetary damages in the amount of $1,041,216, plus applicable interest. The Company filed its answer to the Complaint on December
3, 2024. On January 7, 2025, Mr. Kim filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction against the Company (the “Motion”).
The Company opposed the Motion on January 22, 2025, and on February 13, 2025, the Court denied Mr. Kim’s Motion. Discovery in the
case is ongoing, and no trial date has been set.
The
Company believes it has a basis to defend the claims in the Kim Litigation. The company believes that it is very likely to succeed in
the defense.
Ex-Directors
Lawsuit
On
March 10, 2025, former directors of the Company, Kevin J. Connor, Chris J. Jones, Nobuki Kurita, and David Robson (collectively, the
“Ex-Directors”), filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego (Case No.

last quarter of the fiscal year ended 2023 through the first two quarters of the fiscal year ended 2024, and is claiming breach of contract,
quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair business
practices. The Ex-Directors seek monetary damages in excess of $200,000, with applicable interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. The
Company’s answer to the Complaint was due on April 16, 2025. On April 17, 2025, the Ex-Director’s filed a request for entry

Corporate
Overview
CIMG
Inc. is a company incorporated in Nevada and listed on Nasdaq since June 2020. We were formerly known as “Nuzee, Inc.” with
a previous ticker symbol “NUZE”, and we changed our corporate name and ticker symbol to “CIMG Inc.” and “IMG”
in October 2024. We previously focused on specialty coffee and related technologies but are now expanding our sales and distribution
channels in Asia to encompass a broader range of consumer food and beverage products. This expansion is fueled by our online sales platform,
which leverages a natural language search function.
On
June 7, 2024, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“Share Purchase Agreement”) with Masateru Higashida, our former
Chief Executive Officer and Director, under which we sold all issued and outstanding shares of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, NuZee KOREA
Ltd. and NuZee Investment Co., Ltd., to Mr. Higashida, which sale was completed in June 2024.
Since
July 2024, CIMG has been undergoing a transformation in digital marketing, distribution, and sales. As part of this transformation, we
have extended our sales and distribution network to include maca-infused food and beverages, reaffirming our commitment to reshaping
the online marketing, sales, and distribution landscape for consumer products.
50
Maca,
a plant of the Brassicaceae family that originated in South America, has oval leaves and a rootstock shaped like a small round radish.
It is edible and renowned as a natural superfood. Maca is rich in nutrients, boasts high levels of essential nutrients, and is believed
to nourish and strengthen the human body. It is often referred to as “South American ginseng.” The primary cultivation regions
for maca include the Andes Mountains in South America and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Lijiang, Yunnan, China.
CIMG
has successfully secured the exclusive distribution and sales rights for all maca products produced by Jiangsu Kangduoyuan Beverage Co.,
Ltd., a leading maca production base in Asia. These products include Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Wine, Maca Purified Powder,
and other full-range offerings. Through a comprehensive digital marketing strategy, CIMG is optimistic in its ability to achieve sales
growth and enhance the Company’s enterprise value.
CIMG
aims to become a leading distributor of premium maca products, a natural superfood known for its numerous health benefits. Our business
focuses on sourcing, marketing, and distributing a wide range of maca-based dietary supplements, functional foods, and beauty products.
We operate with a commitment to providing high-quality, sustainably sourced products to consumers who seek to enhance their health and
wellness. Our products are sold through both online channels and a network of retail partners, including grocery stores, convenience
stores, and vending machines.
The
diagram below is our corporate structure as of the date of this report.

Our
sources of revenue
Co-Packing
and Product Innovation
With
years of experience as a third-party contract packer for leading companies in the coffee beverage industry, combined with our own coffee
sales and market insights from the Asian region, we have expanded our business strategy to deepen our industry engagement. This evolution
includes a shift toward reshaping product value by integrating health-oriented concepts and applying advanced technologies such as artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, and big data. These efforts have culminated in the establishment of a global digital health and sales development
business group.
While
we remain committed to delivering our high-quality Nuzee single-serving coffee and DRIPKIT products, our entry into the Asian market
has prompted a broader commitment to health, sustainability, and nutrition.
52
The
Maca Series
In
the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2024, we introduced our first health-focused product line in Asia: the Maca Series.
This product line includes Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca-Noni, Maca Purified Powder, and Maca Wine. Each product features green purification
factors derived from the maca plant, ensuring a natural and clean composition.
Maca,
a plant native to South America and a member of the Brassicaceae family, is known for its nutritional value and adaptogenic properties.
Often referred to as “South American ginseng,” maca is prized for its ability to support stamina, vitality, and overall wellness.
It is primarily cultivated in the Andes Mountains in south America, and Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China.
●
Maca-Noni
– a plant-based energy drink designed to support sexual vitality, with maca root as its key ingredient.
●
Maca
Peptide Coffee – a functional coffee beverage infused with maca peptides for enhanced wellness benefits.
●
Maca
Purified Powder – a concentrated, versatile maca powder ideal for daily nutritional use.
●
Maca
Wine – a unique beverage that combines traditional wine with the nourishing properties of maca.
We
currently distribute our products through wholesale channels, supplying grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine operators.
Looking ahead, we plan to expand into retail services and leverage digital technologies to optimize marketing strategies and diversify
our sales models. Our distribution network already spans both online platforms and offline points of sale.
Our
commitment extends beyond product quality and health benefits—we also focus on enhancing the packaging experience. Each design
is crafted to resonate with professionals across various industries, making our products more personalized, youthful, and distinctive.
For example, Maca-Noni represents a new entry into the functional beverage market, blending health-forward branding with innovative design.
Our
customer base includes wholesale distributors such as grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine providers.
Nasdaq
Listing Deficiency
The
Company received a notification letter from NASDAQ on January 23, 2024 (the “NASDAQ Notification Letter”), indicating that
the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). The
NASDAQ Notification Letter stated that the Company failed to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued
listing, as required by the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement.
Subsequently,
the Company completed a convertible note financing of $320,000 on April 27, 2024, an equity financing of $1,500,000 on June 4, 2024,
and an equity financing of $3,000,000 on July 11, 2024. On July 23, 2024, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ stating that based
on the Company’s Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on July 19, 2024, NASDAQ has determined that the Company has complied with
Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).
On
January 14, 2025, the Company received a notification letter (the “Minimum Bid Price Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications
Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for
continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain
a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement
exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Minimum Bid Price Notice has no immediate effect
on the listing of the Company’s Common Stock, which continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “IMG.”
In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of the Minimum Bid Price Notice,
or until July 14, 2025, to regain compliance. If at any time before July 14, 2025 the closing bid price of the Common Stock closes at
or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide written notification that the Company has
achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter will be resolved. If the Company does not regain compliance
during the compliance period ending July 14, 2025, then NASDAQ may in its discretion determine to grant the Company an additional 180
calendar day period to regain compliance, provided that the Company on July 14, 2025 meets the continued listing requirement for market
value of publicly held shares and all other applicable initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of
the minimum bid price requirement, and will need to provide NASDAQ written notice of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second
compliance period.
53
On
January 17, 2025, the Company received another notice (the “Annual Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company
is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ended September 30, 2024 with the SEC. The Annual Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s
stock on Nasdaq, and it states that the Company is required to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
within 60 calendar days from the date of the Annual Report Notice. If the plan is accepted by Nasdaq, then Nasdaq can grant the Company
up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 to regain compliance. In determining
whether to accept such plan, Nasdaq will consider such things as the likelihood that the remedial filing, along with any subsequent periodic
filing that will be due, can be made within the 180 day period, the Company’s past compliance history, the reasons for the late
filing, other corporate events that may occur within our review period, the Company’s overall financial condition and its public
disclosures. Any subsequent periodic filing that is due within the 180-day exception period must be filed no later than the end of the
period.
On
February 19, 2025, the Company received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024 with the SEC.
We
have submitted a Nasdaq compliance plan to Nasdaq on March 18, 2025 and Nasdaq grant the Company extension to (i) file the Form 10-K
for the period ended September 30, 2024 on or before June 13, 2025; and (ii) file the Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2024
on or before July 14, 2025.
On
May 19, 2025, the Company received a notice (the “Quarterly Report Notice”) from NASDAQ indicating that the Company was not
in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2025 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Quarterly Report Notice has no immediate effect on the listing
of the Company’s stock on Nasdaq.
As
a result of this additional delinquency of the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025, the Company submitted an update to its
original plan to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirement on June 3, 2025.
On June 13, 2025, the Company
did not manage to file its Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 and received a delist determination letter from the Listing
Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on June 27, 2025 (“Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter”). According
to the Nasdaq Delist Determination Letter, unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination by July 7, 2025, trading of the
Company’s common stock will be suspended from The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on July 9, 2025, and NSADAQ will
file a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
The Company intends to file

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
To
date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from registered public offerings and private placements of shares of our
Common Stock. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations, which includes the commercialization of our products, the continuation
of efforts to improve our products, administrative support of our operations and other working capital requirements.
As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of $0.46 million. Considering our current cash resources and our current and expected levels
of operating expenses for the next twelve months, we expect to need additional capital to fund our planned operations for at least twelve
months
This evaluation is based on relevant conditions and events that are currently known or reasonably knowable.
A reduction in consumer demand for, or revenues from the sale of, our coffee products could further constrain our cash resources. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating projections, including our projected revenues
from sales of our coffee products, may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us.
We
intend to seek to raise additional capital, including through a public or private equity offering, to support our operating activities
over the next 12 months and beyond, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or may not be available at all. The timing and
amount of capital we need to raise will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to generate sufficient revenue from the
sale of our products to fund our business operations, and the timing and amount of funds received by warrant holders when they exercise
their outstanding warrant cash. Until we are able to generate sufficient revenue, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity,
equity-linked or debt financing.

Cash
provided from financing activities increased from $(36,031) as of September 30, 2023 to $9,586,272 as of September 30, 2024. The main
reason for the increase is that no funds were raised in the year ending September 30, 2023, while in the year ending September 30, 2024,
we raised funds by selling our equity securities and issuing convertible bonds. During the year ending September 30, 2024, financing

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements that have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). As discussed in
“Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
US GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates, assumptions and disclosures. We choose accounting policies within
US GAAP that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent
manner. Management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. See the “Note 2—Basis
of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our
accounting policies.

Evaluation
on Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our
Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
such information is collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for our Company. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that no matter how well conceived and operated, disclosure controls and procedures can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
56
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as
of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Report based on the criteria for effective internal control
described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024.
As
we are a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to issue an attestation report on our
internal control over financial reporting.

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The
current members of the compensation committee are Jinmei Guo Hellstroem, Changzheng Ye and Yanli Hou. All of these members are independent
directors. The compensation committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s compensation policies generally and making recommendations
to the board of directors with respect to incentive compensation and equity-based plans of the Company that are subject to board of directors
approval, evaluating executive officer performance and reviewing the Company’s management succession plan, overseeing and setting
compensation for the Company’s directors and, as applicable, its executive officers and, as applicable, preparing the report on
executive officer compensation that SEC rules require to be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Currently, none of our executive
officers are compensated by the Company and as such the compensation committee is not required to produce a report on executive officer
compensation for inclusion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 none of the Company’s executive officers served on the board of directors (or a compensation
committee thereof or other board committee performing equivalent functions) of any entities that had one or more executive officers serve
on the compensation committee or on the board of directors. No current or past executive officers or employees of the Company or its
affiliates serve on the compensation committee.
Clawback
Policy
On
January 20, 2023, our Board of Directors adopted Incentive-Based Compensation Clawback Policy (“Clawback Policy”), which
provides for the clawback of certain compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due
to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirements. The Clawback Policy is a supplement to any other
clawback policies in effect now or in the future at the Company. The Incentive-Based Compensation subject to clawback is the Incentive-Based
Compensation Received during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare
an accounting restatement.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The summary of significant accounting policies presented
below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. Such financial statements and accompanying notes
are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies
conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) in all material respects and
have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The Company prepares its financial statements on the
basis of accounting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts, balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
The Company consolidates DZR Tech, Wewin and Beijing
Zhongyan in accordance with ASC 810, and specifically ASC 810-10-15-8 which states, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest
is ownership of a majority voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly,
of over 50% of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per common share are equal to net
earnings or loss divided by the weighted average of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share
reflect the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants and other commitments to issue Common Stock were
exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of Common Stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. As of
September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the total number of Common Stock equivalents was 235,280
and 248,856,
respectively, and composed of stock options and warrants.
Going Concern and Capital Resources
The Company’s consolidated financial statements
are prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially
all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets,
raising capital and the commercialization and manufacture of its single serve coffee products. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash of $464,222 and working capital of $(269,285).
There were continued net losses for the 2 years ended September 30, 2024. These factors raise doubts about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
The Company issued a USD2,000,000
private placement on October 22, 2024, and a USD10,000,000
convertible note on December 12, 2024, to mitigate the condition. The actions have been approved by the BOARD and the cash of total
USD12,000,000
have been raised by the end of March 31, 2025. In addition, the company has signed sales contracts for coffee and beverages with
several American and Chinese companies. Including sales contracts for maca series products signed by enterprises such as Petrochina
Kunlun Haoke Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Jinxianfang Trading Co., LTD. The company’s contracted revenue for the next 12 months from the
date of this report is approximately $8.5 million. With these mitigation plans, the Company is fully capable of sustaining going
concern condition for relevant operations and expansion.
Management
has evaluated the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements
– Going Concern. This evaluation considered the Company’s current financial condition, expected cash flows, obligations due
within the next 12 months, and available sources of liquidity.
While
we understand that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully execute its
new business strategy and eventually attain profitable operations, management has concluded that there are no conditions or events that
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance date
of these consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024
have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Use of Estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-7
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is an estimate of the exit price, representing
the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
(i.e., the exit price at the measurement date).
On August 20, 2024, the Company entered into a convertible note purchase
agreement with certain investors (the “August Notes Investors”) to issue and sell convertible notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $1,300,000 (the “August Notes”).The Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7% and have a maturity date of one
year from the issuance date. The Notes shall not be converted until the Company obtains shareholder approval for the issuance of shares
underlying the Notes. Upon obtaining such approval, the holder may convert the Notes into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to
(i) the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, divided by (ii) $0.94, the conversion price.
Any conversion of the Notes resulting in a fractional share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. On October 31, 2024, the
conversion of this convertible note into stocks has been completed.
Per ASC 470-20-25-5, An embedded beneficial conversion
feature (“BCF”) present in a convertible instrument shall be recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of
the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital.
The company evaluated that the fair value of the
instrument is slightly higher than the proceeds from the instrument issuance. The BCF is embedded in the convertible note.
Still, since the converting period is short (only
50 days) and the fair value of the embedded BCF is relatively small, we decided not to separate the feature until the proceeds to paid-in-capital.
Since we do not directly pay the interest expenses, but to put them in the total repayable amount and convert to shares, we do not amortize
the interest expense.
During the year ended September 30, 2024 and September
30, 2023,the fair value variation on convertible notes is $82,845 and $Nil
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high quality
banking institutions. From time to time, the Company may or may not maintain cash balances at certain institutions in excess of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.
Accounts Receivable
During the year ended September 30, 2024 and
September 30, 2023, accounts receivable were $Nil and $499,582.
Trade accounts receivable is periodically evaluated for
collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. Bad debts expense or write offs of
receivables are determined on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risks in the receivable portfolio and current
economic conditions. The Company had $3,441,782
of allowance for expected credit loss as of September 30, 2024 and $117,015
allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2023.

Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842), to provide guidance on recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclosing
key information about leasing arrangements, specifically differentiating between different types of leases. The Company implemented ASU
No. 2016-02 on October 1, 2019.
The Company conducts a quarterly analysis of leases
to determine if there are any operating leases that require recognition under ASC 842. The Company has a long-term operating lease for
office and manufacturing space in Plano, Texas. The leased property in Plano, Texas, has a remaining lease term through June 2024 and
Tenancy terminated. The Company did not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to operating leases with a remaining lease term
of 12 months or less.
In May 2022, the Company renewed the office
and manufacturing space in Vista, California through March 31, 2025, which was scheduled to expire on January
31, 2023. The lease has a monthly base rent of $8,451,
plus common area expenses. Along with the extension, we
leased an additional 1,796 square
feet that has a monthly base rent of $2,514 through
March 31, 2025.
The Company leased a new larger office and manufacturing
space in Seoul, Korea beginning November 15, 2021, through November 15, 2023. The lease has a monthly expense of $7,040. Accordingly,
we have added ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities related to those leases as of September 30, 2023.
Effective September 1, 2024, we have leased a principal
office space located at 16097 Poppyseed Cir, Unit 1904, Delray Beach, Florida, 33484, which we lease for $3,500 per month until August
31, 2025.
As
of September 30, 2024, the Company’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 1 years and a weighted-average
discount rate of 5%. Other information related to our operating leases is as follows:

Capital Avenue in Plano, Texas, effective October 1, 2020 under favorable terms that are co-terminus with the original lease ended June
30, 2024. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized sublease income of $161,672 pursuant to the sublease included in other
income on our financial statements.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial position and results of operations of
each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign subsidiary’s local currency as the functional currency.
Revenues and expenses of each such subsidiary have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period.
Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. The resulting translation gain and loss
adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, unless there is a sale or complete liquidation
of the underlying foreign investment. Foreign currency translation adjustment attributable to CIMG Inc. recorded to other comprehensive
income and loss amounted to $312,906 and $36,599 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange
rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency.
Equity Method
Investee companies that are not consolidated, but
over which the Company exercises significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Whether or not the Company
exercises significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including, among others, representation
of the investee company’s board of directors and ownership level, which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting
securities of the investee company. Under the equity method of accounting, an investee company’s accounts are not reflected within
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations; however, the Company’s share of the earnings
or losses of the Investee company is reflected in the caption Gain (loss) from equity method investment in the consolidated statements
of operations. The Company’s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption “Investment in
unconsolidated affiliate’’ in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
F-9
When the Company’s carrying value in an equity
method investee company is reduced to zero, no further losses are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements unless
the Company guaranteed obligations of the investee company or has committed additional funding. When the investee company subsequently
reports income, the Company will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously
recognized.
Revenue Recognition
In FY 2024, We have reduced our single-serving
pour-over coffee packaging business, and in the portion of bagged coffee sales, we have added other brands, such as “Maca Coffee”
and other finished products with maca as the main raw material, such as “Maca Noni”. In 2024, we sell maca peptide coffee and
other new products on a distribution model. We usually sign distribution contracts with distributors on a batch basis. Based on the contract,
we deliver the goods after full payment to our bank account. We courier the goods to the customer. The customer will sign a receipt after
receiving the goods. The customers can also choose to pick up their goods from our warehouse on their own. Also, the customer will sign
a receipt.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
in Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605). The new standard’s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services
to a customer. The principles in the standard are applied in five steps: 1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) Identify the
performance obligations in the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract; and 5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We adopted Topic 606 as of October
1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements,
including the presentation of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Per ASC 606-10-32-2, an entity shall consider
the terms of the contract and its customary business practices to determine the transaction price. The transaction price is the amount
of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding
amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer
may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.
Per ASC 606-10-25-23 An entity shall recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
by transferring a promised good or service (that is, an asset) to a customer.
Per ASC 606-10-55-37 An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or
service is transferred to a customer. However, an entity does not necessarily control a specified good if the entity obtains legal title
to that good only momentarily before legal title is transferred to a customer. An entity that is a principal may satisfy its performance
obligation to provide the specified good or service itself or it may engage another party (for example, a subcontractor) to satisfy some
or all of the performance obligation on its behalf.
ASC 606-10-55-38 An entity is an agent if the
entity’s performance obligation is to arrange for the provision
of the specified good or service by another party. An entity that is an agent does not control the specified good or service provided
by another party before that good or service is transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance
obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging
for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. An entity’s
fee or commission might be the net amount of consideration that the entity retains after paying the other party the consideration received
in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party.
Return and Exchange Policy
All products are thoroughly inspected and securely
packaged before they are shipped to ensure buyers receive the best possible product. If for any reason buyers are unsatisfied with the
products, they can return them, and the Company will exchange or refund the purchase minus any shipping charges. For wholesale customers,
return policies vary based on their specific agreements with customers. Under chargebacks agreements with the customers, the Company agrees
to reimburse the seller for a portion of the costs incurred by the seller to advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products.
The Company estimates, accrues and recognizes such chargebacks. These amounts are included in the determination of net sales. As of September
30, 2024, CIMG’s Maca collection has never had a return record.

Samples
The Company distributes samples of its products as

expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
F-11
Long-Lived Assets
The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups
for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances
which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse
changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for
the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast
of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold
or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances.
Goodwill and intangible assets
During the year ended September 30, 2024, we
recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $
0.
Intangible assets have either an identifiable or
indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or
legal life, whichever is shorter. We have identifiable useful life intangible assets related to acquired Dripkit tradename and customer
relationships. We evaluate these intangible assets annually for impairment, and when indications of potential impairment exist. The management
uses considerable judgment to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, projected costs, marketing expenses and projected
profits, etc. This kind of analysis requires important estimates and judgments, including the estimation of future cash flows, which
depends on internal forecasts, the estimation of the long-term growth rate of our business, the estimation of the useful life of the
cash flows that will occur, customer churn, and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
Income Taxes
In accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes, the provision
for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on
available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
The Company also follows the guidance related to accounting
for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of
a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit.
For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit
that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. No liability
for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Related parties
A party is considered to be related to the Company
if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal
owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting
parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that
one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
Stock-based Compensation
We
account for share-based awards issued to employees in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, “Compensation-Stock
Compensation”. Accordingly, employee share-based payment compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of
the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is normally the vesting period. Share-based compensation
to directors is treated in the same manner as share-based compensation to employees, regardless of whether the directors are also employees.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for non-employee transactions by stipulating
that the existing accounting guidance for share-based payments to employees (accounted for under ASC Topic 718, “Compensation-Stock
Compensation”) will also apply to non-employee share-based transactions (accounted for under ASC Topic 505, “Equity”).
The Company implemented ASU 2018-07 on October 1, 2019 and the impact of the implementation was not material to the financial statements.
We
determine the fair value of share-based payments using the Black Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and
the closing price of our common stock for common share issuances. We recognize forfeitures as they occurred.
During the year ended September 30, 2024, we did
not distribute employee stock rewards to our staff.
Comprehensive income/loss
Comprehensive income/loss is defined to include all
changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, all items that
are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income/loss are required to be reported
in a financial statement that is presented with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company’s current component
of other comprehensive income/loss pertains to foreign currency translation adjustments.
Segment Information
ASC Topic 280, “Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information,” established standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments
in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. Management has determined that the Company operates in one business segment, which
is the commercialization and development of functional beverages.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for
convertible debt instruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible
instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities
that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies
as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all
other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
In
November 2023,the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting-Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this Update
improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments
in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this Update retrospectively to all prior
periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods
should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Group adopted ASU
2023-07 in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company concluded that it has no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements
to Income Tax Disclosures, which applies to all entities subject to income taxes. ASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about
a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income
taxes paid. For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities
other than public business entities, the requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The guidance
will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standard updates on its consolidated financial statements.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements
but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted 6,000 new stock options at an exercise price of $8.15 to an employee. These
options shall be vested and become exercisable 1/3 on each anniversary of the grant date. The options will expire ten years from the grant
date, unless terminated earlier as provided by the option agreements.
F-16
The fair value
of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the assumptions noted as
follows: expected volatility was based on the volatility of a peer group of companies. The expected term of options granted was determined
using the simplified method under SAB 107 which represents the mid-point between the vesting term and the contractual term. The risk-free
rate is calculated using the U.S. Treasury yield curve and is based on the expected term of the option.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with
the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted during the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

10. INCOME TAX
The company recorded $0 income tax expense for the years ended September
30, 2024 and 2023.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes.
The Company will have tax losses available to
be applied against future years’ income as result of the losses incurred. However, due to the losses incurred in the period
and expected future operating results, management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset resulting
from the tax losses available for carry forward will not be realized through the reduction of future income tax payments.
Accordingly, a 100%
valuation allowance has been recorded for deferred income tax assets. Cumulative net operating loss carry forward is $51,057,503
and $45,340,996
as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and will begin expiring in 2033. Utilization of these NOLs might be subject to
various limitations such as the IRC Section 382 limitation and the 80% taxable income limitation. A full study of the NOL
limitations has not been completed yet.
The Company used statutory blended tax rates of 28%, 11%
and 33.58% for its deferred tax assets that arose in the US, Korea, and Japan respectively.
Deferred tax assets consisted of the following as
of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

11. CONTINGENCIES
Steeped Litigation

disclosed, on January 27, 2023, Steeped, Inc. d/b/a Steeped Coffee (“Steeped”) filed a complaint against the Company in the
Superior Court of California, Santa Cruz County (Case No. 23CV00234) (the “Complaint”). The Complaint related to Steeped’s
claim that the Company breached a 2021 settlement agreement that resolved Steeped’s 2019 trademark infringement case against the
Company. The earlier case involved Steeped’s purported trademark protection for “steeped coffee” and related phrases.
Steeped
alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,
and fraud in the inducement of contract. Plaintiff sought a trial by jury and relief in the form of a permanent injunction for use of
“Steep Coffee” or any confusingly similar variant of “STEEPED COFFEE”; the impoundment and destruction of allegedly
violating packaging materials and/or finished goods; a final judgment for all profits derived from the Company’s allegedly unlawful
conduct, actual damages, damages to the Steeped’s reputation and goodwill among its customers and partners; and reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs. The Company answered the Complaint with a general denial and asserted twenty-five affirmative defenses.
F-20
On
January 16, 2024, without a finding or admission of wrongdoing, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Steeped. In
exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice, the Company completed the payment of $500,000 on October 3, 2024.

employee of the Company, Jose Ramirez, in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego (Case No. 37-2023-00000841-CU-WT-NC) (the
“Complaint”). The Complaint alleged that Ms. Curtin was subject to harassment by Mr. Ramirez, gender discrimination throughout
her employment, that she reported this discrimination and harassment to the Company, and that the Company retaliated against her and wrongfully
terminated her for whistleblowing and failed to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Ms. Curtin sought compensatory damages,
including loss of past, present and future earnings, and benefits, as well as punitive damages, penalties, attorney’s fees and costs
and interest. Pursuant to the terms of Ms. Curtin’s Employment Agreement with the Company, on December 22, 2023, the Court compelled
the case to arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (Case Number 01-24-0002-3225).

case was dismissed in its entirety.
Kim Litigation
On October 3, 2024, Mr. Sooncha Kim filed a complaint
against the Company in the Southern District of New York, (Case No. 1:24-cv-7485) (the “Complaint”). The Complaint alleges
that the Company breached a Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated June 6, 2024, between the Company and Mr. Kim, by,
among other things, failing to deliver the registration rights agreement, excluding Mr. Kim from the S1 registration statement, delaying
conversion of Mr. Kim’s notes, undertaking steps to dilute Mr. Kim’s shares, failing to honor Mr. Kim’s 50% participation
right in any subsequent financing and failing to appoint a designated director, as set forth in the parties’ agreement. Mr. Kim
seeks specific performance of the Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, and monetary damages in the amount of $1,041,216, plus
applicable interest. The Company filed its answer to the Complaint on December 3, 2024. On January 7, 2025, Mr. Kim filed a motion seeking
a preliminary injunction against the Company (the “Motion”). The Company opposed the Motion on January 22, 2025, and on February

be successful in its defense.
