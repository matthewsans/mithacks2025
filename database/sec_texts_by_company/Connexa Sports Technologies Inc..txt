Sports Technologies Inc (the “Company”) is unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April
30, 2025 (the “Form 10-K”) by the prescribed time period required for smaller reporting companies without unreasonable effort
and expense because additional time is required by the Company’s management, working in conjunction with the Company’s independent
auditors, to complete the Company’s audit for the year ended April 30, 2025. The Company’s auditors are carrying out an audit
of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 as well as for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025. In addition, the Company’s operating
subsidiary is adjusting its year end to match that of the Company. The Company is diligently working with its auditors and anticipates
that it will file the Form 10-K no later than the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date.

On March 18, 2024, the Company entered into a share
purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) to acquire
70% of Yuanyu Enterprise Management Co., Limited (“YYEM”) from Mr. Hongyu Zhou, the sole shareholder of YYEM (“YYEM
Seller”) for a combined $56 million (the “Acquisition”). $16.5 million of this amount was paid in cash on March 20,
2024 pursuant to the Purchase Agreement to acquire 20% of YYEM.
On
November 21, 2024, following The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC’s (“Nasdaq”) approval of the new listing application submitted
to it in connection with the Acquisition, the Company completed the purchase of 5,000 ordinary shares of YYEM, representing 50% of the
issued and outstanding ordinary shares of YYEM, for 8,127,572 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001
per share (the “Common Stock”) to the YYEM Seller, representing 55.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
as of the date of the closing (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). As part of this transaction, the Company agreed to sell
its wholly owned subsidiary, Slinger Bag Americas Inc., to a newly established Florida limited liability company called J&M Sports
LLC (“J&M”). J&M is owned by Yonah Kalfa, former Chief Innovation Officer and director of the Company; Mike Ballardie,
former President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and director of the Company; Juda Honickman, former Chief Marketing Officer of the
Company; and Mark Radom, former general counsel and Secretary of the Company. On November 21, 2024, the Company entered into a separation
and assignment agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with J&M to sell, transfer, and assign all or substantially all
of its legacy business, assets, and liabilities related to or necessary for the operations of its “Slinger Bag” business
or products (the “Legacy Business”) to J&M, in consideration for $1.00. Following the Separation Agreement, J&M has
obtained the sole right to and assumed all the obligations of the Legacy Business and is liable to the Company for any losses arising
from third-party claims against the Company that arise from liabilities related to the Legacy Business. As a result of the completion
of the Acquisition, the Company’s directors and officers resigned from their positions on November 21, 2024.
The
Company, in the Form 10-K, will report its consolidated financial results for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 with respect to
the operations of YYEM.
