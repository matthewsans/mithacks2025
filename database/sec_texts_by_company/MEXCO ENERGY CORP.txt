CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
(the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”).
These forward-looking statements are generally located in the material set forth under the headings “Risk Factors”, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Business”, “Properties” but
may be found in other locations as well, and are typically identified by the words “could”, “should”, “expect”,
“project”, “estimate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “budget”,
“plan”, “forecast”, “predict” and other similar expressions.
Forward-looking
statements generally relate to our profitability; planned capital expenditures; estimates of oil and gas production; future project dates;
estimates of future oil and gas prices; estimates of oil and gas reserves; our future financial condition or results of operations; and
our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations and are based upon our management’s reasonable estimates
of future results or trends. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties affecting our business, including those discussed in “Risk Factors”.
The factors that may affect our expectations regarding our operations include, among others, the following: our success in development,
exploitation and exploration activities; our ability to make planned capital expenditures; declines in our production or prices of oil
and gas; our ability to raise equity capital or incur additional indebtedness; our restrictive debt covenants; our acquisition and divestiture
activities; weather conditions and events; the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities;
increases in the cost of drilling, completion and gas gathering or other costs of production and operations; and other factors discussed
elsewhere in this document. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.
PART
I
ITEM
1. BUSINESS
General
Mexco
Energy Corporation, a Colorado corporation, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development
and production of crude oil and natural gas properties located in the United States. Incorporated in April 1972 under the name Miller
Oil Company, the Company changed its name to Mexco Energy Corporation effective April 30, 1980. At that time, the shareholders of the
Company also approved amendments to the Articles of Incorporation resulting in a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s
common stock.
Our
total estimated proved reserves at March 31, 2025 were approximately 1.401 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”) of
which 48% was oil and 52% was natural gas, and our estimated present value of proved reserves was approximately
$23 million based on estimated future net revenues excluding taxes discounted at 10% per annum, pricing and other assumptions set forth
in “Item 2 – Properties” below.
Nicholas
C. Taylor beneficially owns approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Taylor is also our Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Taylor has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the
election of our Board members. Mr. Taylor participates in all facets of our business and has a significant impact on both our business
strategy and daily operations.

Company
Profile
Since
our inception, we have been engaged in acquiring and developing oil and gas properties and the exploration for and production of natural
gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) within the United States. We especially seek to acquire proved
reserves that fit well with existing operations or in areas where Mexco has established production. Acquisitions preferably will contain
most of their value in producing wells, behind pipe reserves and high quality proved undeveloped locations. Competition for the purchase
of proved reserves is intense. Sellers often utilize a bid process to sell properties. This process usually intensifies the competition
and makes it extremely difficult to acquire reserves without assuming significant price and production risks. We actively search for
opportunities to acquire proved oil and gas properties. However, because the competition is intense, we cannot give any assurance that
we will be successful in our efforts during fiscal 2026.
While
we own oil and gas properties in other states, the majority of our activities are centered in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico.
The Company also owns producing properties and undeveloped acreage in fourteen states. We acquire interests in producing and non-producing
oil and gas leases from landowners and leaseholders in areas considered favorable for oil and gas exploration, development and production.
In addition, we may acquire oil and gas interests by joining in oil and gas drilling prospects generated by third parties. We may also
employ a combination of the above methods of obtaining producing acreage and prospects. In recent years, we have placed primary emphasis
on the evaluation and purchase of producing oil and gas properties, including working, royalty and mineral interests, and prospects that
could have a potentially meaningful impact on our reserves. All of the Company’s oil and gas interests are operated by others.
From
1983 to 2025, Mexco Energy Corporation made numerous acquisitions of royalties, overriding royalties, minerals and working interests
in producing oil and gas properties including the following most significant acquisitions:
1990-1994
Royalty interests,
aggregate purchase price of approximately $501,000 covering multiple wells in the Gomez (Ellenberger) Field of Pecos County, Texas.
1993-2014
Tabbs Bay Oil Company and
Thompson Brothers Lumber Company, respectively dissolved in 1957 and 1947. Purchase covering thousands of acres located respectively
in 19 counties of Texas, 3 parishes of Louisiana and one county in Arkansas and 8 counties of Texas, respectively consisting of various
mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests.

Industry
Environment and Outlook
The
commodity price environment was challenging in fiscal 2025. The war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, rising interest rates, global
supply chain disruptions, concerns about a potential economic downturn or recession and measures to combat persistent inflation and instability
in the financial sector have contributed to recent economic and pricing volatility and may continue to impact pricing throughout fiscal
2026. In light of these challenges facing our industry and in response to the continued challenging environment, our primary business
strategies for fiscal 2026 will continue to include: (1) optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies and cost reductions, (2)
divesting of non-core assets, and (3) working to balance capital spending with cash flows to minimize borrowings and maintain ample liquidity.
See
Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of our fiscal
2025 operating results and potential impact on fiscal 2026 operating results due to commodity price changes.
Oil
and Gas Operations
As
of March 31, 2025, oil contributed approximately 84% of our oil and natural gas sales and approximately 48% of our total proved reserves
volumes for fiscal 2025. Revenues from oil and gas royalty interests accounted for approximately 31% of our total operating revenues
for fiscal 2025.
There
are two primary areas in which the Company is focused, 1) the Delaware Basin located in the Western portion of the Permian Basin including
Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Reeves and Loving Counties, Texas and 2) the Midland Basin located in the Eastern portion of the
Permian Basin including Reagan, Upton, Midland, Martin, Howard and Glasscock Counties, Texas. The Permian Basin in total accounts for
80% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves and 80% of our gross revenues.
The
Permian Basin is one of the oldest and most prolific producing basins in North America which has been a significant source of oil production
since the 1920s. The Permian Basin is known to have a number of zones of oil and natural gas bearing rock throughout.
The
Delaware Basin properties, encompassing 39,850 gross acres, 211 net acres, 751 gross producing wells or 4 net wells account for approximately
67% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2025. For fiscal 2025, these properties accounted for
65% of our gross revenues. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 27% are attributable to proven
undeveloped reserves which would be developed through new drilling.
6
The
Midland Basin properties, encompassing 114,077 gross acres, 232 net acres, 1,652 gross producing wells or 4 net wells account for approximately
12% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2025. For fiscal 2025, these properties accounted for
14% of our gross revenues. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 3% are attributable to proven
undeveloped reserves which would be developed through new drilling.
Mexco
believes its most important properties for future development by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing area are located in Lea
and Eddy Counties, New Mexico of the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin in Midland, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas.
For
more on these and other operations in this area see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources Commitments”.
We
own partial interests in approximately 7,500 producing wells all of which are located within the United States in the states of Texas,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Montana, Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota and Ohio.
Additional information concerning these properties and our oil and gas reserves is provided below.

Competition
and Markets
The
oil and gas industry is a highly competitive business. Competition for oil and gas reserve acquisitions is significant. We may compete
with major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators, some of which have
financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available to us. As a result, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage.
Competitive factors include price, contract terms and types and quality of service, including pipeline distribution. The price for oil
and gas is widely followed and is generally subject to worldwide market factors. Our ability to acquire and develop additional properties
in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive
environment in a timely manner.
In
addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial,
commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenue.
Market
factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price we can obtain for the production from our oil and natural
gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general
level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of
industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental,
energy conservation and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
The
market for our oil, gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control including: domestic and foreign political
conditions; the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and natural gas liquids; the price of imports of oil and gas; weather
conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;
and overall economic conditions.

Historically,
the Company has not experienced significant credit losses on our oil and gas accounts and management is of the opinion that significant
credit risk does not exist. Because a ready market exists for oil and gas production, we do not believe the loss of any individual purchaser
would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Environmental
Regulation
The
oil and gas industry is extensively regulated at the federal, state, and local levels. Regulations affecting elements of the energy sector
are under constant review for amendment or expansion and frequently more stringent requirements are imposed. Various federal and state
agencies, including the Texas Railroad Commission, the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”), an agency of the U.S Department
of the Interior (“DOI”), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (the “EPA”), the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(“OSHA”), have legal and regulatory authority and oversight over the operations on the properties in which the Company owns
an interest.
Under
certain environmental laws and regulations, the operators of the Company properties could be subject to strict, joint and several liability
for the removal or remediation of property contamination, whether at a drill site or a waste disposal facility, even when the operators
did not cause the contamination or their activities were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the actions were taken. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “superfund”
law, for example, imposes liability, regardless of fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for releases
into the environment of a “hazardous substance.” Liable persons may include the current or previous owner and operator of
a site where a hazardous substance has been disposed and persons who arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. Under
CERCLA and similar statutes, government authorities or private parties may take actions in response to threats to the public health or
the environment or sue responsible persons for the associated costs. In the course of operations, the working interest owner and/or the
operator of the Company properties may have generated and may generate materials that could trigger cleanup liabilities. In addition,
the Company properties have produced oil and/or natural gas for many years, and previous operators may have disposed or released hydrocarbons,
wastes or hazardous substances at the Company properties. The operator of the Company properties or the working interest owners may be
responsible for all or part of the costs to clean up any such contamination. Although the Company is not the operator of such properties,
its ownership of the properties could cause it to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent CERCLA or any similar statute
imposes responsibility on such parties as “owners.”
Various
state governments and regional organizations comprising state governments already have enacted legislation and promulgated rules restricting
greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) emissions or promoting the use of renewable energy, and additional such measures are frequently
under consideration. Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future requirements addressing GHG emissions
would impact operations on the Company properties and revenue, either directly or indirectly, any future federal, state or local laws
or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require the operators of our properties to incur new or
increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install new emission controls, acquire allowances to
authorize GHG emissions, pay taxes related to GHG emissions or administer a GHG emissions program. Regulation of GHGs could also result
in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are
exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, the Company properties may be adversely affected to a greater degree than previously
experienced.
We
did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended March 31, 2025. Additionally,
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures
during fiscal 2026.
8
Other
Regulation
Other
agencies with certain authority over the Company’s business include the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the SEC
and NYSE. Ensuring compliance with the rules, regulations and orders promulgated by such entities requires extensive effort and incremental
costs to comply, which affects the Company’s profitability. Because public policy changes are commonplace, and existing laws and
regulations are frequently amended, the Company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance. However, the Company does
not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect its operations materially differently than they would affect other companies
with similar operations, size and financial strength.
Title
to Properties
The
leasehold properties we own are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The
properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under
oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere
with the use of these properties.
Prior
to drilling of an oil and natural gas well, it is normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of
the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of
such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails
expense. Our operators’ failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest.
We believe the title to our properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally acceptable in the oil and gas industry
subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of counsel employed in the various areas in which we have activities, are not so material
as to detract substantially from the use of such properties.
Substantially
all of our properties are currently mortgaged under a deed of trust to secure funding through a credit facility.
Insurance
Our
operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for and development and production of oil and gas including blowouts,
fires and other casualties. We maintain insurance coverage customary for operations of a similar nature, but losses could arise from
uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
The
Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business. The following summarizes significant risks
and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We could also face additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs,
it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline.
Investors should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
Volatility
of oil and gas prices significantly affects our results and profitability.
Prices
for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty. Historically, the markets
for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that can cause price fluctuations include
the level of global demand for petroleum products; foreign supply and pricing of oil and gas; the actions of OPEC, its members and other
state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls; nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation,
including environmental regulations; level of domestic and international exploration, drilling and production activity; the cost of exploring
for, producing and delivering oil and gas; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; availability, proximity
and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; weather conditions; the price and availability of alternative
fuels; technological advances affecting energy consumption; national and international pandemics; and, overall political and economic
conditions in oil producing countries.
10
Increases
and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise
additional capital. The amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices. In addition, we
may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be
produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes
and not as a result of drilling or well performance.
Changes
in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction in reserves,
including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility and adversely affect the amount
of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our exploration and development activities.
Oil
and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Lower prices or lack of storage may have an
adverse affect on our financial condition due to reduction of our revenues, operating income and cash flows; curtailment or shut-in of
our production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity; cause certain properties in our portfolio to become economically unviable;
and, limit our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations.
Our
results of operations may be negatively impacted by current global events, including the imposition of tariffs.
Our
business, financial condition and future results are subject to political and economic risks and uncertainties, including volatility
in the political, legal and regulatory environments as a result of the change in U.S. presidential administration and instability resulting
from civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes or armed conflict or other crises in crude oil or natural gas producing areas
such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Iran conflict. Escalating trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico, China and other countries, may lead
to the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions. Our operators could face unanticipated costs and competition for materials and components
to continue their current drilling plans. In addition, the current U.S. presidential administration
has signaled it will encourage increased domestic production of crude oil, which could lead to falling crude oil and natural gas prices.
Changes
in environmental laws could increase our operators’ costs and adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.
In
recent years the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, including methane, a primary component of natural
gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas. Addressing GHG emissions with legislation on emissions fees could
increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry.
Fluids
resulting from crude oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt-water, are disposed by injection in belowground disposal
wells. In recent years, state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between fluid injection and increased
seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has suspended or limited new well permits for salt water disposal wells, particularly
in the Permian Basin. Increased regulation on the treatment and disposal of fluids could increase operating costs and curtail economical
drilling.
Lower
oil and gas prices and other factors may cause us to record ceiling test writedowns.
Lower
oil and gas prices increase the risk of ceiling limitation write-downs. We use the full cost method to account for oil and gas operations.
Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas properties including the cost of abandoned
properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are
accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties
is computed in the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs are amortized over total proved reserves. Under the full cost
accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a “ceiling limit” which
is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at 10% plus the lower of cost or
fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit, we must
charge the amount of the excess against earnings. This is called a “ceiling test writedown.” We use the unweighted arithmetic
average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted
future net reserves. Under the accounting rules, we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. A ceiling test writedown does
not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce stockholders’ equity and earnings. The risk that we will be required
to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low. There were no ceiling
test impairments on our oil and gas properties during fiscal 2025 and 2024.
11
We
must replace reserves we produce.
Our
future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional, economically recoverable oil and gas reserves. Our proved
reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we can find, develop or acquire replacement reserves.
One offset to the obvious benefits afforded by higher product prices especially for small to mid-cap companies in this industry, is that
quality domestic oil and gas reserves are hard to find.
Approximately
28% and 33% of our total estimated net proved reserves at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, were undeveloped, and those reserves
may not ultimately be developed.
Recovery
of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will
make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. Delays in the development
of our reserves, increases in costs to develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues or
our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, if we or the outside operators
of our properties choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not able to successfully develop these reserves,
we will be required to write-off these reserves. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could
reduce the value of our common stock.
Information
concerning our reserves and future net revenues estimates is inherently uncertain.
Estimates
of oil and gas reserves, by necessity, are projections based on engineering data, and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation
of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Reserve engineering
is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure. Estimates of economically
recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as future
production, oil and gas prices, operating costs, development costs and remedial costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual
results. As a result, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas and of future net cash flows expected therefrom
may vary substantially. As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on a twelve
month un-weighted first-day-of-the-month average oil and gas prices for the twelve months prior to the date of the report. Actual future
prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.
An
increase in the differential between NYMEX and the reference or regional index price used to price our oil and gas would reduce our cash
flow from operations.
Our
oil and gas is priced in the local markets where it is produced based on local or regional supply and demand factors. The prices we receive
for our oil and gas are typically lower than the relevant benchmark prices, such as The New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”).
The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. Numerous factors may influence local pricing,
such as refinery capacity, pipeline capacity and specifications, upsets in the midstream or downstream sectors of the industry, trade
restrictions and governmental regulations such as policies of the Trump Administration. Additionally, insufficient pipeline capacity,
lack of demand in any given operating area or other factors may cause the differential to increase in a particular area compared with
other producing areas. During fiscal 2025, differentials averaged $2.79 per Bbl of oil and ($0.30) per Mcf of gas. Increases in the differential
between the benchmark prices for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could significantly reduce our revenues and our cash flow
from operations.

Drilling
and operating activities are high risk activities that subject us to a variety of factors that we cannot control.
These
factors include availability of workover and drilling rigs, well blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, formations with abnormal pressures,
pollution, releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks. Any of these operating hazards could result in substantial
losses to us. In addition, we incur the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered, and there is no assurance
that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in wells drilled or re-entered.
We
may not be able to fund the capital expenditures that will be required for us to increase reserves and production.
We
must make capital expenditures to develop our existing reserves and to acquire new reserves. Historically, we have used our cash flow
from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our capital expenditures, however, lower oil and gas prices may prevent
these options. Volatility in oil and gas prices, the timing of our drilling programs and drilling results will affect our cash flow from
operations. Lower prices and/or lower production will also decrease revenues and cash flow, thus reducing the amount of financial resources
available to meet our capital requirements, including reducing the amount available to pursue our drilling opportunities.
The
borrowing base under our credit facility will be determined from time to time by the lender. Reductions in estimates of oil and gas reserves
could result in a reduction in the borrowing base, which would reduce the amount of financial resources available under the credit facility
to meet our capital requirements. Such a reduction could be the result of lower commodity prices and/or production, inability to drill
or unfavorable drilling results, changes in oil and gas reserve engineering, the lender’s inability to agree to an adequate borrowing
base or adverse changes in the lender’s practices regarding estimation of reserves. If cash flow from operations or our borrowing
base decrease for any reason, our ability to undertake exploration and development activities could be adversely affected. As a result,
our ability to replace production may be limited.
Our
identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter
the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
Our
management and outside operators have specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year
drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability
to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability
of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals and other factors. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish
sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects. Because of these uncertainties, we do not
know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil
or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations.
Our
business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities which are owned by others.
The
marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines
and processing facilities. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes
in supply and demand and general economic conditions could all affect our ability to produce and market our oil and gas.
We
own non-operating interests in properties developed and operated by third parties and, as a result, we are unable to control the operation
and profitability of such properties.
We
participate in the drilling and completion of wells with third-party operators that exercise exclusive control over such operations.
As a participant, we rely on third-party operators to successfully operate these properties pursuant to joint operating agreements and
other similar contractual arrangements. As a participant in these operations, we may not be able to maximize the value associated with
these properties in the manner we believe appropriate, or at all. For example, we cannot control the success of drilling and development
activities on properties operated by third-parties, which depend on a number of factors under the control of a third-party operator,
including such operator’s determinations with respect to, among other things, the nature and timing of drilling and operational
activities, the timing and amount of capital expenditures and the selection of suitable technology. In addition, the third-party operator’s
operational expertise and financial resources and its ability to gain the approval of other participants in drilling wells will impact
the timing and potential success of drilling and development activities in a manner that we are unable to control. A third-party operator’s
failure to adequately perform operations, breach of the applicable agreements or failure to act in ways that are favorable to us could
reduce our production and revenues, negatively impact our liquidity and cause us to spend capital in excess of our current plans, and
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
13
Acquiring
reserves in the oil and gas industry is highly competitive.
Competition
for oil and gas reserve acquisitions is significant. We may compete with major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies
and individual producers and operators, some of which have financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available
to us. As a result, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Our ability to acquire and develop additional properties in the future
will depend upon our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects for future development activities.
We
may not be insured against all of the operating hazards to which our business is exposed.
Our
operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for, and development and production of oil and gas including blowouts,
fires and other casualties. We maintain insurance coverage customary for operations of a similar nature, but losses could arise from
uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.
Changes
in effective tax rates or laws could adversely impact our results of operations.
Our
future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the valuation
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; tax effects of stock-based compensation; or changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations
thereof.
For
example, in previous years, legislation has been proposed to eliminate or defer certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions historically
available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes have included: a repeal of the percentage
depletion allowance for crude oil and natural gas properties; the elimination of deductions for intangible drilling and exploration and
development costs; the elimination of the deduction for certain production activities; and an extension of the amortization period for
certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or other similar changes
in U.S. federal income tax laws that alter, eliminate or defer these or other tax deductions utilized within the industry could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our
reliance on information technology, including those hosted by third parties, exposes us to cyber security risks that could affect our
business, financial condition or reputation.
The
oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production,
and processing activities, including digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering
systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber
incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that
indicate energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our and our operators’ technologies, systems, networks,
and those of vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that
could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or
other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended
period. Our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may
be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any
vulnerability to cyber incidents.
14
The
loss of our chief executive officer or president could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy.
We
depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer, Nicholas C.
Taylor and our President and Chief Financial Officer, Tamala L. McComic, who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and
analyzing producing oil and gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and gas properties and developing and
executing acquisitions and financing. As of March 31, 2025, we do not have key-man insurance on the lives of Mr. Taylor and Ms. McComic.
The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could, therefore, significantly and adversely affect our operations.
We
may be affected by one substantial shareholder.
Nicholas
C. Taylor beneficially owns approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Taylor is also our Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Taylor has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the
election of our Board members. Mr. Taylor participates in all facets of our business and has a significant impact on both our business
strategy and daily operations. The retirement, incapacity or death of Mr. Taylor, or any change in the power to vote shares beneficially
owned by Mr. Taylor, could result in negative market or industry perception and could have an adverse effect on our business.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
We
may issue additional shares of common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to all shareholders.
We
may seek to raise additional equity capital in the future. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock will dilute the percentage
ownership interest of all shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock.
Control
by our executive officers and directors may limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval and
could discourage our potential acquisition by third parties.
As
of March 31, 2025, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 49% of our common stock. These stockholders,
if acting together, would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election
of our board of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.
The
price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially.
Mexco
common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange’s NYSE American. The market price of our common stock has and could continue
to experience volatility due to reasons unrelated to our operating performance. These reasons include: supply and demand for oil and
natural gas; political conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions; demand for our common stock and limited trading volume; investor
perception of our industry; fluctuations in commodity prices; variations in our results of operations; legislative or regulatory changes;
general trends in the oil and natural gas industry; market conditions and analysts’ estimates; and, other events in the oil and
gas industry.
Many
of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. We cannot assure
you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets
in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.

ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY
Mexco
maintains a cybersecurity program that aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data required by our business
to be stored, analyzed, transported, and/or processed. We have implemented various internal and external controls and processes, including
internal risk assessment and policy implementation, to incorporate a risk-based cybersecurity framework to monitor and mitigate security
threats and other strategies to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure.
Risk
Management and Strategy. Mexco recognizes the risk that cybersecurity threats pose to our operations, and cybersecurity is an
important component of our overall risk management strategy. Mexco’s cybersecurity team consists of our executive officers and
third-party cybersecurity personnel. The third-party cybersecurity team, led by professionals with cybersecurity expertise across multiple
industries, takes a cross-functional approach to addressing these risks and engages in discussions with our executive management team
on an as-needed basis.
We
have implemented a monitoring and detection system to help promptly identify cybersecurity incidents. We also require our employees to
receive annual cybersecurity awareness training. We perform cybersecurity tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of our incidence
response plan (“IRP”) and implement post-incident “lessons learned” to enhance our response. We provide our system
users with access consistent with the principle of least privilege, which requires that such users be given no more access than necessary
to complete their job functions. We have programs in place to monitor our retained data with the goal of identifying personal identifiable
information and taking appropriate actions to secure the data.
We
have an IRP that delineates the procedures to be followed for handling a variety of cybersecurity incidents; categorizes potential cybersecurity
incidents and the required timeframe for reporting each; establishes cybersecurity incident response levels; provides for investigations
designed to help us to meet applicable legal obligations, including possible notification requirements; and outlines the roles and responsibilities
for various personnel in the event of a cybersecurity incident.
Governance.
The Board, in coordination with the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for the oversight of risks from
cybersecurity threats. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include overseeing policies and management systems for cybersecurity
matters and reviewing Mexco’s strategy, objectives, and policies relative to cybersecurity. In addition, the Board and the Audit
Committee receive regular presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks that address a range of topics, including developments, technological
trends or tools, third party updates, and regulatory standards. Our IRP calls for prompt and timely direct notifications and updates
to the Board (or its committees) as necessary in connection with cybersecurity incidents deemed to have a moderate or higher business
impact, even if immaterial. On a periodic basis, the Board and the Audit Committee discuss our approach to cybersecurity with our executive
officers and cybersecurity personnel.
Management
plays a role in assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats through membership on our cybersecurity team, as
well as by making final materiality determinations and disclosures and other compliance decisions, as reflected in our IRP.
Impact
of Risks from Cybersecurity Threats. As of the date of this Report, we are not aware of any previous cybersecurity threats that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations
or financial condition. Notwithstanding the approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a
cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us.
For
more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” above for additional information.
ITEM
2. PROPERTIES
Our
properties consist primarily of oil and gas wells and our ownership in leasehold acreage, both developed and undeveloped. As of March
31, 2025, we had interests in approximately 7,500 gross (26.4 net) producing oil and gas wells and owned leasehold mineral, royalty and
other interests in approximately 662,000 gross (2,712 net) acres.
16
Oil
and Natural Gas Reserves
In
accordance with current SEC rules, the average prices used in computing reserves at March 31, 2025 were $73.79 per bbl of oil compared
to $76.88 in 2024, a decrease of 4%, and $2.14 per mcf of natural gas compared to $2.75 in 2024, a decrease of 22%, such prices are based
on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average market prices for sales of oil and natural gas on the first calendar day of each month
during fiscal 2025. The benchmark price of $71.00 per bbl of oil at March 31, 2025 versus $73.96 at March 31, 2024, was adjusted by lease
for gravity, transportation fees and market differentials and did not give effect to derivative transactions. The benchmark price of
$2.44 per mcf of natural gas at March 31, 2025 versus $2.45 at March 31, 2024, was adjusted by lease for BTU content, transportation
fees and market differentials.
For
information concerning our costs incurred for oil and gas operations, net revenues from oil and gas production, estimated future net
revenues attributable to our oil and gas reserves, present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% and changes therein, see Notes
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Proved
reserves are estimated reserves of crude oil (including condensate) and natural gas that geological and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. Proved developed reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells, equipment and operating methods. Proved
undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on undrilled acreage
for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty, or from existing wells on which
a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production.
The
engineering report with respect to Mexco’s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves as of March 31, 2025 and 2024 is based on evaluations
prepared by Russell K. Hall and Associates, Inc. Environmental Engineering Consultants, based in Midland, Texas (“Hall and Associates”),
a summary of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report.
Management
maintains internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved reserves are computed and reported
in accordance with rules and regulations provided by the SEC. As stated above, Mexco retained Hall and Associates to prepare estimates
of our oil and gas reserves. Management works closely with this firm, and is responsible for providing accurate operating and technical
data to it. Our Chief Financial Officer who has over 30 years experience in the oil and gas industry reviews the final reserves estimate
and consults with a degreed geological consultant with extensive geological experience and if necessary, discusses the process used and
findings with Alan Neal, the technical person at Hall and Associates responsible for evaluating the proved reserves covered by this report.
Mr. Neal is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has over 40 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer who has over 50 years of experience in the oil and gas industry also reviews the final reserves estimate.
Numerous
uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves. Reserve estimates are imprecise and subjective and may change at any
time as additional information becomes available. Furthermore, estimates of oil and gas reserves are projections based on engineering
data. There are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of this data as well as the projection of future rates of production. The
accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. Actual
future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil
and gas reserves will most likely vary from the assumptions and estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated
quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which in turn may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and the availability
of capital resources.
Per
the current SEC rules, the prices used to calculate our proved reserves and the present value of proved reserves set forth herein are
made using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price. All prices are held constant throughout the
life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those as of the date of the estimate. The
timing of both the production and the expenses with respect to the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the
timing of future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties
containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as
reserves are produced.
17
Our
estimated proved oil and gas reserves and present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves in the periods
ended March 31 are summarized below.

(2)
The PV-10 Value represents
the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and gas reserves before income tax, discounted at 10% per annum,
which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted
future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes.
Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies.
We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. Our reconciliation
of this non-GAAP financial measure is shown in the table as the PV-10, less future income taxes, discounted at 10% per annum, resulting
in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represents
the present value of future cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves after income tax, discounted at 10%.
(3)
In accordance with SEC
requirement, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was computed by applying 12-month first day of the month
average prices for oil and gas during the fiscal year to the estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated
future expenditures (based on year-end costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less estimated future
income tax expenses (based on year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated) to be incurred
on pretax net cash flows less tax basis of the properties and available credits, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.
(4)
These prices reflect adjustment
by lease for quality, transportation fees and market differentials.
During
fiscal 2025, we added proved reserves of 101 thousand BOE (“MBOE”) through extensions and discoveries, added 77 MBOE through
acquisitions, subtracted 145 MBOE for downward revisions of previous estimates. Such downward revisions are primarily attributable to
reserves written off due to the five-year limitation and the change in the timing of new development. The reserves written off were primarily
in Lea County, New Mexico due to a change in the timing of development in wells in which we own a working interest. These interests are
held by production and still in place to be developed in the future.
During
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, we had a working or royalty interest in the development of 27 wells, converting reserves of approximately
84,000 BOE from proved undeveloped to proved developed – producing with a capital cost of approximately $645,000.
18
Oil
and gas prices significantly impact the calculation of the PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The
present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of the Company’s proved reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected
recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks
inherent in producing oil and gas. Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and
costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required by Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 932, “Extractive Activities
– Oil and Gas”, may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate
is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
We
have not filed any other oil or gas reserve estimates or included any such estimates in reports to other federal or foreign governmental
authorities or agencies during the year ended March 31, 2025, and no major discovery is believed to have caused a significant change
in our estimates of proved reserves since that date.

The
information contained in the foregoing table should not be considered indicative of future drilling performance, nor should it be assumed
that there is any necessary correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the amount of oil and gas that may ultimately
be recovered by us.
In
addition to the working interests mentioned above, other operators drilled 120 gross wells (.09 net wells) on company-owned minerals
and royalties at no expense to the Company. We expect the production of our mineral interests will increase as operators continue to
drill, complete, and develop our acreage. We expect to capitalize on this development, which requires no capital expenditure funding
from us and believe the anticipated aggregate royalty receipts will enable us to grow our cash flows. A number of the horizontal wells
in which the Company participates involve longer lateral which are more efficient and have greater estimated ultimate recovery.
Productive
Wells and Acreage
Productive
wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including gas wells awaiting pipeline connections. Wells that are completed
in more than one producing zone are counted as one well. As of March 31, 2025, we held an interest in approximately 7,500 gross (26.4
net) productive wells, including approximately 6,400 wells in which we held an overriding or royalty interest and 1,100 wells in which
we held a working interest.
19
A
gross acre is an acre in which an interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership interests in
gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional interests owned in gross acres. The following table sets
forth the approximate developed acreage in which we held a leasehold mineral or other interest as of March 31, 2025:

Stockholders
As
of March 31, 2025, we had 2,239,283 shares issued and 809 shareholders of record, which does not include shareholders for whom shares
are held in a “nominee” or “street” name. Of these issued shares, 193,283 are held in the treasury. As of March

Dividends
Prior
to March 31, 2023, the Company had never paid a cash dividend to the Company’s shareholders. Payment of dividends is at the discretion
of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) after considering many factors, including our financial condition, operating results,
current and anticipated cash needs, and plans for expansion. In addition, our current bank loan prohibits us from paying cash dividends
on our common stock without written permission.
On
April 30, 2024, the Company announced that its Board declared a regular annual dividend of $0.10 per common share to its shareholders
of record at the close of business on May 21, 2024. The dividend was paid on June 4, 2024. The Company obtained written permission from
West Texas National Bank (“WTNB”) prior to declaring the regular annual dividend. On April 10, 2023, the Company announced
that its Board declared a special dividend of $0.10 per common share to its shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1,
2023. The special dividend was paid on May 15, 2023. The Company obtained written permission from WTNB prior to declaring the special
dividend.
Subsequently,
on May 13, 2025, the Company announced that its Board declared a regular annual dividend of $0.10 per common share to its shareholders
of record at the close of business on June 2, 2025. The dividend was paid on June 16, 2025. The Company obtained written permission from
WTNB prior to declaring the regular annual dividend.
The
Company can provide no assurance that dividends will be authorized or declared in the future or as to the amount or type of any future
dividends. Our Board determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount
of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable
law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination.

7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition, changes in our financial
condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Commitments
Historically,
we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures from cash generated by operating activities, bank
borrowings, sales of non-core properties and issuance of common stock. Our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves.
We have pledged our producing oil and gas properties to secure our credit facility. We do not have any delivery commitments to provide
a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement.
Our
long-term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low-cost operations by acquiring and
developing oil and gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties and
working interests and non-operated properties in areas with significant development potential.
Cash
Flows
Changes
in the net funds provided by or (used in) each of our operating, investing and financing activities are set forth in the table below:
For the Years Ended March 31,

$54,852
Cash
Flow Provided by Operating Activities. Cash flow from operating activities is primarily derived from the production of our crude
oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property asset
account balances. Cash flow provided by our operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 was $4,269,621 in comparison to $4,433,935
for the year ended March 31, 2024. This decrease of $164,314 in our cash flow operating activities consisted of increase in our non-cash
expenses of $156,176; an increase in our accounts receivable of $533,564; an increase of $52,861 of our accounts payable and accrued
expenses; and, an increase in our net income for the current year of $367,416. Variations in cash flow from operating activities may
impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.
Our
expenditures in operating activities consist primarily of drilling expenses, production expenses and engineering services. Our expenses
also consist of employee compensation, accounting, insurance and other general and administrative expenses that we have incurred in order
to address normal and necessary business activities of a public company in the crude oil and natural gas production industry.
Cash
Flow Used in Investing Activities. Cash flow from investing activities is derived from changes in oil and gas property balances.
For the year ended March 31, 2025, we had net cash of $3,154,575 used for additions to oil and gas properties and a $1,000,000 investment
in two limited liability companies compared to $3,016,499 and $400,000, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2024.
Cash
Flow Used in Financing Activities. Cash flow from financing activities is derived from our changes in long-term debt and in equity
account balances. Net cash flow used in our financing activities was $834,575 for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to net cash
flow used in our financing activities of $779,723 for the year ended March 31, 2024. During the year ended March 31, 2025, we expended
$209,000 to pay the annual dividend, expended $703,216 to purchase 57,766 shares of our stock for the treasury account, and received
proceeds of $77,641 for the exercise of employee stock options. During the year ended March 31, 2024, we expended $213,600 to pay the
annual dividend, expended $585,035 to purchase 50,101 shares of our stock for the treasury account, and received proceeds of $19,662
for the exercise of employee and director stock options.
23
Accordingly,
net cash decreased $719,529, leaving cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1,753,955 as of March 31, 2025.
We
had working capital of $2,469,664 as of March 31, 2025 compared to working capital of $3,259,200 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of
$789,536 for the reasons set forth below.
Oil
and Natural Gas Property Development.
New
Participations in Fiscal 2025. The Company participated in the development of 35 horizontal wells at a cost of approximately
$1,100,000 for the year ending March 31, 2025. Seventeen of these wells have not been completed. Twenty-nine of these wells are in the
Delaware Basin located in the western portion of the Permian Basin in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico; three wells are in the Midland
Basin located in the eastern portion of the Permian Basin in Reagan County, Texas; and, the remaining three horizontal wells are in Grady
County, Oklahoma.
In
addition to the above working interests, there were 120 gross wells (.09 net wells) drilled by other operators on Mexco’s royalty
interests and 840 gross wells (2.31 net wells) obtained through acquisitions.
Mexco
expended approximately $207,000 to participate in the drilling of five horizontal wells in the Bone Spring formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico. In November 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 1,106 barrels
of oil, 2,583 barrels of water and 1,165,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,300 BOE per day.
Mexco
expended approximately $293,000 to drill and complete four horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp Sand formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea
County, New Mexico. In November 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 1,089 barrels of oil, 4,716
barrels of water and 3,601,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,689 BOE per day.
Mexco
expended approximately $117,000 for the drilling and completion of two horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico. Mexco’s working interest in these wells is .5%. In March 2025, these wells were completed with
initial average production rates of 1,734 barrels of oil, 3,171 barrels of water and 3,229,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 2,272 BOE
per day.
Mexco
expended approximately $176,000 for the drilling and completion of two horizontal wells in the Penn Shale formation of the Delaware Basin
in Lea County, New Mexico. Mexco’s average working interest in these wells is .5%. Subsequently, in June 2025, one of these wells
were completed with initial average production rates of 676 barrels of oil, 1,899 barrels of water and 729,000 cubic feet of gas per
day, or 798 BOE per day
Mexco
expended approximately $46,000 for the drilling of two horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea
County, New Mexico. Mexco’s working interest in these wells is .28%.
Mexco
expended approximately $70,000 to participate in the drilling of six horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico. Mexco’s working interest in these wells is .16%. Subsequently, in May 2025, Mexco expended approximately
$85,000 to complete these wells.
Mexco
expended approximately $70,000 to participate in the development of three horizontal wells in the Spraberry trend of the Midland Basin
in Reagan County, Texas. Mexco’s working interest in these wells is approximately .26%.
Mexco
expended approximately $32,000 to participate in an exploratory well in the Fusselman Formation of Irion County, Texas. This well was
determined to be noncommercial and was plugged and abandoned.
In
October 2022, the Company made an approximately 2% equity investment commitment in a limited liability company amounting to $2,000,000
of which $1,800,000 has been funded as of March 31, 2025. The limited liability company is capitalized at approximately $100 million
to purchase mineral interests in the Utica and Marcellus areas in the state of Ohio. This LLC has returned $252,394 or 14% of the total
investment.
24
Completion
of Wells Drilled in Fiscal 2024. The Company expended approximately $300,000 for the completion of 19 horizontal wells in which the
Company participated during fiscal 2024.
The
Company expended approximately $107,000 for the completion costs of two horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico that the Company participated in drilling during fiscal 2024. Mexco’s working interest in these
wells is .53%. In July 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 1,402 barrels of oil, 2,009 barrels
of water and 2,168,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,763 BOE per day.
Five
horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico in which the Company participated
during fiscal 2024 were completed in April 2024 with initial average production rates of 732 barrels of oil, 1,481 barrels of water and
657,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 842 of oil equivalent per day. Mexco’s working interest in these wells is approximately 1.16%.
A
horizontal well in the Penn Shale formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico was completed in May 2024 with the initial
production rate of 964 barrels of oil, 2,441 barrels of water and 626,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,068 of oil equivalent per day.
Mexco’s working interest in this well is .165%.
The
Company expended approximately $207,000 for the completion costs of four horizontial wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico that the Company participated in drilling during fiscal 2024. Mexco’s working interest in these
wells is .45%. In October 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 893 barrels of oil, 2,990 barrels
of water and 1,161,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,087 BOE per day.
Acquisitions.
In April 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 21 producing wells operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Cimarex
Energy Company and located in Reeves County, Texas, for a purchase price of $158,000.
In
August 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 6 producing wells operated by Marathon Oil and located in Karnes County, Texas,
for a purchase price of $50,000. This acquisition was effective August 1, 2024.
In
August 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 10 producing wells operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and located in Weld
County, Colorado, for a purchase price of $118,000 and royalty interests in approximately 250 producing wells operated by Samson Exploration,
EOG Resources, and others in Laramie County, Wyoming and Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado, for a purchase price of $483,000. All of
these acquisitions were effective September 1, 2024.
In
September 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 21 producing wells operated by Marathon Oil and Murphy Exploration and located
in Karnes County, Texas, for a purchase price of $90,000, effective August 1, 2024.
In
October 2024, the Company acquired a .3% royalty interest in 15 producing wells operated by Civitas Resources, Inc. and located in Broomfield
and Adams Counties, Colorado, for a purchase price of $450,000. This acquisition was effective November 1, 2024.
In
October 2024, the Company acquired a .5% royalty interest in 3 producing wells operated by Mewbourne Oil Company and located in Eddy
County, New Mexico, for a purchase price of $260,000. This acquisition was effective November 1, 2024 and includes acreage for further
development.
In
October 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 8 producing wells operated by Marathon Oil and located in Live Oak County, Texas,
for a purchase price of $20,000; royalty interests in 6 producing wells operated by SWN Production Company, LLC and located in DeSoto
Parish, Louisiana, for a purchase price of $25,000; royalty interests in 10 producing wells operated by Ovintiv, Inc. and located in
Upton County, Texas, for a purchase price of $65,000; and, royalty interests in 12 producing wells operated by Pioneer Natural Resources
and located in Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas, for a purchase price of $65,000. All of these acquisitions were effective November 1,
2024.
25
Also,
in October 2024 and effective November 1, 2024, the Company acquired various small royalty interests in over 400 producing wells operated
by Petro-Hunt Corporation, Hess Bakken Investments II, LLC, Marathon Oil, WPX Energy, and others in multiple counties throughout the
states of Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana for a purchase price of $188,000.
Sale
of Properties. In November 2024, the Company conveyed its working and royalty interests in 13.5 net acres in Ward County, Texas.
The Company received $15,000 per acre in the total amount of $202,500. The Company retained an overriding royalty interest equal to the
positive difference between 25% and any existing burdens of record as of the effective date. The divestiture of this non-core oil and
gas asset did not result in a significant alteration of the relationship between the Company’s capitalized costs and proved reserves
and, accordingly, the Company recorded the proceeds as sales proceeds, a reduction of its full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized
on the sale.
Other
Projects. We are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate. The cost of such projects
would be funded, to the extent possible, from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. The remainder may be funded through
borrowings on the credit facility and, if appropriate, sales of non-core properties.
Pricing.
Crude oil and natural gas prices generally remained volatile during the last year. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely
difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX
West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of $61.73 per bbl in September 2024 to a
high of $82.89 per bbl in April 2024. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price (“Henry Hub”) for natural gas has ranged from a low
of $1.21 per MMBtu in November 2024 to a high of $9.86 per MMBtu in January 2025.
On
March 31, 2025 the WTI posted price for crude oil was $67.46 per bbl and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $4.11 per MMBtu.
See Results of Operations below for realized prices. Pipeline capacity constraints and maintenance in the Permian Basin area has contributed
to a wider difference between the WaHa Hub and the Henry Hub and at times realized prices were negative.
Results
of Operations
Fiscal
2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024
We
had net income of $1,712,368 for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to $1,344,952 for the year ended March 31, 2024, a 27% increase
primarily as a result of an increase in operating revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that is further explained
below.
Oil
and natural gas sales. Revenue from oil and natural gas sales was $7,116,485 for the year ended March 31, 2025, a 10% increase from
$6,462,647 for the year ended March 31, 2024. This resulted from an increase in oil and natural gas production volumes partially offset
by a decrease in oil and natural gas prices. The following table sets forth our oil and natural gas revenues, production quantities and
average prices received during the fiscal years ended March 31:

Other
operating revenues. Other revenues increased 70% to $241,581 in fiscal 2025 from $142,237 in fiscal 2024. This resulted from an increase
in income from one of our limited liability company investments.
26
Interest
income. Interest income on corporate funds decreased 46% to $72,629 in fiscal 2025 from $135,476 in fiscal 2024. This decrease resulted
from using the corporate funds for property acquisitions and purchase of treasury stock.
Production
and exploration. Production costs were $1,605,096 in fiscal 2025, a 5% increase from $1,526,472 in fiscal 2024. This is the result
of an increase in production taxes due to an increase in oil and gas revenues and an increase in lease operating
expenses on new wells in which we own an interest.
Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $2,452,694 in fiscal 2025,
a 25% increase from $1,969,742 in fiscal 2024. This was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas production and a decrease
in oil and natural gas reserves.
General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $1,320,074 for the year ended March 31, 2025, a 6% increase
from $1,243,548 for the year ended March 31, 2024. This was primarily due to an increase in salaries and contract services, office expense,
engineering services and legal expenses partially offset by a decrease in employee stock option compensation.
Income
taxes. Income tax for fiscal 2025 was $304,330 compared to $620,544 for fiscal 2024. This was primarily due to a decrease in state
income taxes and the reconciliation to the federal tax return. The effective tax rate for state and federal taxes combined for fiscal
2025 and fiscal 2024 was 15% and 32%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of state income taxes,
primarily in New Mexico, the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income, and the reconciliation to the federal tax
return.
Contractual
Obligations
We
have no off-balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The following table summarizes
future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of March 31, 2025:

1 year and $13,567 1-3 years for his portion of the shared office space.
Alternative
Capital Resources
Although
we have primarily used cash from operating activities, the sales of assets and funding from the credit facility as our primary capital
resources, we have in the past, and could in the future, use alternative capital resources. These could include joint ventures, carried
working interests and issuances of our common stock through a private placement or public offering.
Other
Matters
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
In
preparing financial statements, management makes informed judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to litigation, environmental liabilities, income
taxes, fair value and determination of proved reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual
results may differ from these estimates.
The
following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require
the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
27
Full
Cost Method of Accounting for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Activities. SEC Regulation S-X defines the financial accounting and reporting
standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities. Two methods are prescribed: the successful efforts method and
the full cost method. We have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration
and development are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition, exploration and
development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. The carrying
amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement
obligation (“ARO”) when incurred.
Sales
of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs. Gain
or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas. This includes any sales of properties such as Term assignments
and Assignments, Bill of Sales and Conveyances.
Under
the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged
to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation,
depletion, amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well, lease, or
field basis versus the “full cost” pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil
and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that
apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher DD&A
rate on our crude oil and natural gas properties.
At
the time it was adopted, management believed that the full cost method would be preferable, as earnings tend to be less volatile than
under the successful efforts method. However, the full cost method makes us more susceptible to significant non-cash charges during times
of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low. These charges are not recoverable when prices
return to higher levels. Our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life. However, temporary drops in commodity prices
can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting.
Ceiling
Test. Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to
perform a ceiling test each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test to determine a limit, or ceiling, on the book value
of oil and gas properties. That limit is basically the after-tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and
natural gas reserves plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural
gas properties exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This is called a “ceiling limitation
write-down.” This impairment to our oil and gas properties does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce
our stockholders’ equity and reported earnings.
The
risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural
gas prices are depressed or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated
proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long-term contracts for natural gas production. An expense recorded in one period may not be
reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the
subsequent period.
Estimates
of our proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate, with reasonable
certainty, to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters. Our reserve estimates
and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates, in accordance with SEC guidelines by an independent engineering
firm based in part on data provided by us. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available
data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, and the judgment of the persons preparing
the estimate. Estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend
on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities
of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate
may justify material revisions to the estimate.
28
It
should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In
accordance with SEC requirements, the cost ceiling represents the present value (discounted at 10%) of net cash flows from sales of future
production using the average price over the prior 12-month period.
The
estimates of proved reserves materially impact DD&A expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record
DD&A expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic
to drill for and produce higher cost projects.
Use
of Estimates. In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, management is required to make informed judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. In addition, significant estimates are used in determining year end proved oil and gas reserves. Although management believes
its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The estimate of our oil and
natural gas reserves, which is used to compute DD&A and impairment of oil and gas properties, is the most significant of the estimates
and assumptions that affect these reported results.
Excluded
Costs. Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments
in unproved properties and major development projects. These costs are excluded until proved reserves are found or until it is determined
that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of
any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool). Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool
increase the DD&A rate.
Revenue
Recognition. Revenues from our royalty and non-operated working interest properties are recorded
in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is reported net of post-production costs
when such costs are contractually deducted by the operator prior to distribution. Since the revenue
checks are generally received two to three months after the production month, the Company accrues for revenue earned but not received
by estimating production volumes and product prices. Any identified differences between its revenue estimates and actual revenue received
historically have not been significant.
Asset
Retirement Obligations. The estimated costs of plugging, restoration and removal of facilities are accrued. The fair value of a liability
for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and
the capitalized cost is depreciated by the units of production method. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded
amount, a gain or loss is recognized. For all periods presented, we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement
in the full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense.
Stock-based
Compensation. We use the Binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation expenses at grant date.
This expense is recognized as compensation expense in our financial statements over the vesting period. We recognize the fair value of
stock-based compensation awards as wages in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on a graded-vesting schedule over the vesting
period.
Accounts
Receivable. Our accounts receivable includes trade receivables from joint interest owners and oil and gas purchasers. Credit is extended
based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and, generally, is uncollateralized. The collectibility of receivables
is assessed and an allowance is made for any credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on a number of factors,
including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current
ability to pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole.
29
Income
Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates applicable to the years in which those differences are expected to be settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period that includes the enactment date. Any interest and penalties are recorded
as interest expense and general and administrative expense, respectively.
Other
Property and Equipment. Provisions for depreciation of office furniture and equipment are computed on the straight-line method based
on estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
Investments.
The Company accounts for investments of less than 3% of any limited liability companies at cost. The Company has no control of the
limited liability companies. The cost of the investment is recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets and when income from
the investment is received, it is immediately recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates investments
for an impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable.
Indicators of impairment may include, but are not limited to, sustained declines in market value, investee financial condition and operating
performance, industry or economic trends, and other relevant factors.
Reclassifications.
Certain amounts in prior periods’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations, retained earnings or net cash flows.
Segments.
Based on the Company’s organizational structure, the Company has one operating segment, which is crude oil and natural gas development,
exploration and production. In addition, the Company has a single, company-wide management team that allocates capital resources to maximize
profitability and measures financial performance as a single enterprise.
Leases.
The Company determines an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right-of-use asset,
operating lease liability, current, and operating lease liability, long-term on the consolidated balance sheets.
Operating
lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate,
the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value
of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate used at adoption was 9%. Significant judgement is required when determining the incremental
borrowing rate. Rent expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Topic 740 Income Taxes: Improvements to Income
Tax Disclosures, which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this
standard provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changs to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This
ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. While the adoption of this ASU will modify the company’s
disclosures, it will not have an impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
New
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Topic 220 Income Statement – Reporting
Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of the Income Statement Expenses. The amendments in this
update require disclosure in the Company’s annual and interim consolidated financial statements of specified information about
certain costs and expenses, including depletion, depreciation and amortization recognized as part of crude oil and natural gas producing
activities, and employee compensation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027. While the adoption of this ASU will modify the company’s disclosures, it will not have
an impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The
primary source of market risk for us includes fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. All of our financial instruments are
for purposes other than trading.
Credit
Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our primary
credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized. At
March 31, 2025, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was $478,863 or 43% of our total oil and gas receivables.
We have not experienced any significant credit losses.
Energy
Price Risk. Our most significant market risk is the pricing applicable to our crude oil and natural gas production. Our financial
condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil
and natural gas. Prices for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this
volatility to continue in the future.
Factors
that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign and domestic supply of oil and gas,
the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability
of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing and consuming countries.
30
For
example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) posted price for crude oil has ranged from
a low of $61.73 per bbl in September 2024 to a high of $82.89 per bbl in April 2024. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price (“Henry Hub”)
for natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.21 per MMBtu in November 2024 to a high of $9.86 per MMBtu in January 2025.
On
March 31, 2025 the WTI posted price for crude oil was $67.46 per bbl and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $4.11 per MMBtu.
See Results of Operations above for realized prices. Pipeline capacity constraints and maintenance in the Permian Basin area has contributed
to a wider difference between the WaHa Hub and the Henry Hub and at times realized prices were negative. Subsequently, on June 16, 2025,
the WTI posted price for crude oil was $67.75 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was $2.90.
Declines
in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating
results. Changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction
in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility and adversely affect
the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our acquisition, exploration
and development activities. In addition, a noncash write-down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting
rules if prices declined significantly, even if it is only for a short period of time. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
— Ceiling Test under Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that
can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price
changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance.
Similarly,
any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.
Oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. If the average oil price had increased
or decreased by ten dollars per barrel for fiscal 2025, our pretax income would have changed by $835,640. If the average gas price had
increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for fiscal 2025, pretax income would have changed by $570,012.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Our
internal control over financial reporting is supported by appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful
selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Conduct adopted by our Board, applicable to all directors, officers
and employees of Mexco.
31
Our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness our internal control over financial reporting using the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 “Internal Control - Integrated
Framework”. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2025.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information we must disclose
in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. At the end of the period covered by this
report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on such evaluation, such officers concluded that, as of March 31, 2025,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. No changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred
during the year ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mexco Energy Corporation (a Colorado corporation) and Subsidiaries (the
Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial
statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Estimation
of proved reserves impacting the recognition and valuation of depletion expense and impairment of oil and gas properties.
F-2
Critical
Accounting Matter Description
As
described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting
which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues and expenses to calculate depletion expense.
To estimate the volume of proved reserves and future revenues, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting
the production decline rate of producing properties and forecasting the timing and volume of production associated with the Company’s
development plan for proved undeveloped properties. In addition, the estimation of proved reserves is also impacted by management’s
judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with proved reserves to determine if wells are expected,
with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required in the estimation of depletion expense.
We identified the estimation of proved reserves of oil and gas properties, due to its impact on depletion expense and impairment evaluation,
as a critical audit matter.
The
principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of proved reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain
inputs and assumptions, which require a high degree of subjectivity necessary to estimate the volume and future revenues of the Company’s
proved reserves could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense or the impairment assessment. In turn, auditing
those inputs and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgment.
How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
We
obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management’s controls and our audit procedures related to the estimation
of proved reserves included the following, among others.
●We
evaluated the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company’s reservoir engineering
specialists and their relationship to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers
regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company’s proved
reserve volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company’s specialists.
●To
the extent key, sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine proved reserve volumes
and other cash flow inputs and assumptions are derived from the Company’s accounting
records, such as commodity pricing, historical pricing differentials, operating costs, estimated
capital costs and working and net revenue interests, we tested management’s process
for determining the assumptions, including examining the underlying support, on a sample
basis. Specifically, our audit procedures involved testing management’s assumptions
as follows:
-Compared
the estimated pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related
to revenue transactions recorded in the current year;
-Evaluated
the models used to estimate the operating costs at year-end compared to historical operating
costs;
-Compared
the models used to determine the future capital expenditures and compared estimated future
capital expenditures used in the reserve report to amounts expended for recently drilled
and completed wells;
-Evaluated
the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report by inspecting a sample of
ownership interests, historical pricing differentials, and operating costs to underlying
support from the Company’s accounting records.
-Evaluated
the Company’s evidence supporting the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected
in the reserve report by examining historical conversion rates and support for the Company’s
or the operator’s intent to develop the proved undeveloped properties;
-Applied
analytical procedures to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and
to the prior year reserve report.

MEXCO
ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years
Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
1.
Nature of Operations
Mexco
Energy Corporation (a Colorado corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Forman Energy Corporation (a New York corporation), Southwest
Texas Disposal Corporation (a Texas corporation) and TBO Oil & Gas, LLC (a Texas limited liability company) (collectively, the “Company”)
are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas, condensate and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”). Most of the Company’s oil and gas interests are centered in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico; however,
the Company owns producing properties and undeveloped acreage in fourteen states. All of the Company’s oil and gas interests are
operated by others.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mexco Energy Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions associated with the consolidated operations have been eliminated.
Estimates
and Assumptions. In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”), management is required to make informed judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates are used in determining proved oil and gas reserves. Although
management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The estimate
of the Company’s oil and natural gas reserves, which is used to compute depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of
oil and gas properties, is the most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect these reported results.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturities of three months or less
and money market funds to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts that may, at times, exceed federally
insured limits. At March 31, 2025, the Company had on deposit all of its cash and cash equivalents with three financial institutions.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk.
Accounts
Receivable. Accounts receivable includes trade receivables from joint interest owners and oil and gas purchasers. Credit is extended
based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and, generally, is uncollateralized. The collectibility of receivables
is assessed and an allowance is made for any credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on a number of factors,
including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current
ability to pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company has not experienced
any significant credit losses. For the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no allowance has been made for any credit losses.
Oil
and Gas Properties. The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Under this method,
all acquisition, exploration and development costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved
oil and natural gas reserves. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but
does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. The carrying amount of oil and gas
properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation (“ARO”)
when incurred. Sales of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized
costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas. This includes any sales of properties such as Term Assignments and Assignments, Bill
of Sales and Conveyances. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby
capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
F-8
Excluded
Costs. Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments
in unproved properties and major development projects. These costs are excluded until proved reserves are found or until it is determined
that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of
any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”)
pool). Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate. No costs were excluded for the years ended March 31,
2025 and 2024.
Ceiling
Test. Under the full cost method of accounting, a ceiling test is performed each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment
test to determine a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of oil and gas properties. That limit is the after-tax present value of the
future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves and using an average price over the prior first day of the month
12-month period held flat for the life of production plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized
costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit, the Company must charge the amount of the excess to earnings
as an expense reflected in additional accumulated DD&A. This is called a “ceiling limitation write-down.” This impairment
to our oil and gas properties does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce stockholders’ equity and reported
earnings.
Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization. The depreciable base for oil and gas properties includes the sum of capitalized costs, net of accumulated
DD&A, estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not accrued in oil and gas properties, less costs excluded from
amortization and salvage. The depreciable base of oil and gas properties is amortized using the unit-of-production method.
Asset
Retirement Obligations. The Company has significant obligations to plug and abandon natural gas and crude oil wells and related equipment
at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company records the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which
it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement costs included
in the carrying amount of the related asset are allocated to expense using the units of production method. In addition, increases in
the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.
Estimating
the future ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes
adequate restoration. The Company uses the present value of estimated cash flows related to the ARO to determine the fair value. Inherent
in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted
discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future
revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related
asset.
Income
Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates applicable to the years in which those differences are expected to be settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in net income in the period that includes the enactment date. Any interest and penalties are recorded
as interest expense and general and administrative expense, respectively.
Other
Property and Equipment. Provisions for depreciation
of office furniture and equipment are computed on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three3
to ten
years.
Income
Per Common Share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share assumes the exercise of all stock options having exercise prices less than the average
market price of the common stock during the period using the treasury stock method and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares (stock options) outstanding during the period. In periods where
losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes potential common shares, because their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive.
F-9
Revenue
Recognition.
Revenues from our royalty and non-operated working interest properties are recorded in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is reported net of post-production costs
when such costs are contractually deducted by the operator prior to distribution. Since the revenue checks are generally received two to three months
after the production month, the Company accrues for revenue earned but not received by estimating production volumes and product prices.
Any identified differences between its revenue estimates and actual revenue received historically have not been significant.
Stock-based
Compensation. The Company uses the Binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation expenses
at grant date. This expense is recognized as compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements over the vesting period. The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards as wages within general and administrative expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations based on a graded-vesting schedule over the vesting period.
Reclassifications.
Certain amounts in prior periods’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations, retained earnings or net cash flows.
Investments.
The
Company accounts for investments of less than 3% in limited liability companies at cost.
The Company has no control of the limited liability companies. The cost of the investment is recorded as an asset on the consolidated
balance sheets and when income from the investment is received, it is immediately recognized on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company evaluates investments for an impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an investment may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include, but are not limited to, sustained declines in market value,
investee financial condition and operating performance, industry or economic trends, and other relevant factors.
Segments.
Based on the Company’s organizational structure, the Company has one operating segment, which is crude oil and natural gas development,
exploration and production. In addition, the Company has a single, company-wide management team that allocates capital resources to maximize
profitability and measures financial performance as a single enterprise.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources. Historically, we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures from cash
generated by operating activities, bank borrowings, sales of non-core properties and issuance of common stock. Our long-term strategy
is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low-cost operations by acquiring and developing oil and
gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties and working interest, non-operated
properties in areas with significant development potential.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Topic 740 Income Taxes: Improvements to Income
Tax Disclosures, which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this
standard provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changs to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This
ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. While the adoption of this ASU will modify the company’s
disclosures, it will not have an impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
New
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Topic 220 Income Statement – Reporting
Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of the Income Statement Expenses. The amendments in this
update require disclosure in the Company’s annual and interim consolidated financial statements of specified information about
certain costs and expenses, including depletion, depreciation and amortization recognized as part of crude oil and natural gas producing
activities, and employee compensation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027. While the adoption of this ASU will modify the company’s disclosures, it will not have
an impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
3.
Long-Term Debt
On
December 28, 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Agreement”) with West Texas National Bank (“WTNB”),
which originally provided for a credit facility of $1,000,000 with a maturity date of December 28, 2021. The Agreement has no monthly
commitment reduction and a borrowing base to be evaluated annually. On February 28, 2020, the Agreement was amended to increase the credit
facility to $2,500,000, extend the maturity date to March 28, 2023 and increase the borrowing base to $1,500,000. On March 28, 2023,
the Agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to March 28, 2026.
Under
the Agreement, interest on the facility accrues at a rate equal to the prime rate as quoted in the Wall Street Journal plus one-half
of one percent (.5%) floating daily. Interest on the outstanding amount under the Agreement is payable monthly. In addition, the Company
will pay an unused commitment fee in an amount equal to one-half of one percent (.5%) times the daily average of the unadvanced amount
of the commitment. The unused commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter. As of March 31,
2025, there was $1,500,000 available for borrowing by the Company on the facility.
F-10
No
principal payments are anticipated to be required through the maturity date of the credit facility, March 28, 2026. Upon closing the
second amendment to the Agreement, the Company paid a loan origination fee of $9,000 plus legal and recording expenses totaling $12,950,
which are amortized over the life of the credit facility.
Amounts
borrowed under the Agreement are collateralized by the common stock of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries and substantially
all of the Company’s oil and gas properties.
The
Agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on change in control, disposition of
assets, mergers and reorganizations. The Company is also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the Agreement and requires
senior debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratios (Senior Debt/EBITDA) less
than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 measured with respect to the four trailing quarters and minimum interest coverage ratios (EBITDA/Interest
Expense) of 2.00 to 1.00 for each quarter.
In
addition, the Agreement prohibits the Company from paying cash dividends on its common stock without prior written permission of WTNB.
The Company obtained written permission from WTNB prior to declaring the special dividend on April 10, 2023 and the regular annual dividend
on April 30, 2024 as discussed in Note 9. The Agreement does not permit the Company to enter into hedge agreements covering crude oil

Income Taxes
In
August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA 2022”). The
IRA 2022, among other tax provisions, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of
certain large corporations (generally, corporations reporting
more than $1 billion of average adjusted pre-tax net income
on their consolidated financial statements), effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA 2022 also
establishes a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations, effective for stock repurchases after
December 31, 2022. The IRA 2022 did not impact the Company’s current year tax provision or the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

The
Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns. The amount of income taxes the Company records
requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of federal and state taxing jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the earliest
year open to examination by U.S. federal and state income tax jurisdictions is 2020.
The
income tax provision consists of the following for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

The
federal statutory rate was 21% for fiscal years ending March 31, 2025 and 2024.
For
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions.
While
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next 12 months, the Company does not expect any change to have a significant
impact on its results of operations. The recognition of the total amount of the unrecognized tax benefits would have an impact on the
effective tax rate. If these unrecognized tax benefits are disallowed, the Company will be required to pay additional taxes.

Major Customers
Currently,
the Company operates exclusively within the United States and its revenues and operating profit are derived from the oil and gas industry.
Oil and gas production is sold to various purchasers and the receivables are unsecured. Historically, the Company has not experienced
significant credit losses on its oil and gas accounts and management is of the opinion that significant credit risk does not exist. Management
is of the opinion that the loss of any one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to sell its oil
and gas production.
In
fiscal 2025, Purchaser A accounted for 58% of the total operating revenues and 43% of the total oil and natural gas accounts receivable;
Purchaser B accounted for 5% of the total operating revenues and 6% of the total oil and natural gas accounts receivable; and, Purchaser
C accounted for 4% of the total operating revenues and 11% of the total oil and natural gas accounts receivable. In fiscal 2024, Purchaser
A accounted for 59% of the total operating revenues and 48% of the total oil and natural gas accounts receivable and Purchaser B accounted
for 8% of the total operating revenues and 8% of the total oil and natural gas accounts receivable.

Stockholders’ Equity
In
April 2024, the Company’s Board (the “Board”) authorized the use of up to $1,000,000 to repurchase shares of the Company’s
common stock, par value, $0.50, for the treasury account. This program does not have an expiration date and may be modified, suspended
or terminated at any time by the Board. Under the repurchase program, share of common stock may be purchased from time to time through
open market purchases or other transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases will be subject to the availability of stock, prevailing
market conditions, the trading price of stock, our financial performance and other conditions. Repurchases may also be made from time-to-time
in connection with the settlement of our share-based compensation awards. Repurchases will be funded from cash flow.
On
August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA 2022”). The IRA 2022, among other
tax provisions, establishes a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations, effective for stock repurchases
in excess of an annual limit of $1,000,000 after December 31, 2022.
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 57,766 shares for the treasury account at an aggregate cost of $703,216, an average
price of $12.17 per share per share. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 50,101 shares for the treasury account
at an aggregate cost of $585,035, an average price of $11.68 per share.

10.
Stock-based Compensation
In
September 2019, the Company adopted the 2019 Employee Incentive Stock Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for
the award of stock options up to 200,000 shares and includes option awards as well as stock awards. Option awards are granted with the
restriction of requiring payment for the shares. Stock awards are granted without restrictions and without payment by the recipient.
Neither option awards nor stock awards may exceed 25,000 shares granted to any one individual in any fiscal year. Stock options may be
an incentive stock option or a nonqualified stock option. Options to purchase common stock under the plan are granted at the fair market
value of the common stock at the date of grant, become exercisable to the extent of 25% of the shares optioned on each of four anniversaries
of the date of grant, expire ten years from the date of grant and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates. The 2019 Plan expires
ten years from the date of adoption. According to the Company’s employee stock incentive plan, new shares will be issued upon the
exercise of stock options and the Company can repurchase shares exercised under the plan.
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, there were no stock options granted. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors approved and the Company granted 32,000 stock options.
The
plan also provides for the granting of stock awards. No stock awards were granted during fiscal 2025 and 2024.
The
Company recognized compensation expense of $205,639 and $229,799 related to vesting stock options in general and administrative expense
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The total cost related to non-vested awards not
yet recognized at March 31, 2025 totals $280,173, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of 1.54 years.
The
fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Binomial valuation model. Expected volatilities are based
on historical volatility of the Company’s stock over the contractual term of 120 months and other factors. The Company uses historical
data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is derived
from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant. No dividend yield was used in the calculation on current options outstanding because at the time of the last issuance of stock
options, either no dividend had been declared or the Company had only declared a special one-time dividend. Actual value realized, if
any, is dependent on the future performance of the Company’s common stock and overall stock market conditions. There is no assurance
the value realized by an optionee will be at or near the value estimated by the Binomial model.
Included
in the following table is a summary of the grant-date fair value of stock options granted and the related assumptions used in the Binomial
models for stock options granted in fiscal 2025 and 2024. All such amounts represent the weighted average amounts for each period.

awards. During the year ended March 31, 2025, 2,500 unvested stock options were forfeited due to the resignation of an employee. During
the year ended March 31, 2024, there were no stock options forfeited or expired.

paid on behalf of the principal stockholder. The total billed to and reimbursed by the stockholder for the years ended March 31, 2025
and 2024 were $31,506 and $23,379, respectively. The principal stockholder pays for his share of the lease amount for the shared office
space directly to the lessor. Amounts paid by the principal stockholder directly to the lessor for the year ending March 31, 2025 and

Commitments and Contingencies
From
time to time the Company is a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that the Company considers to be part of the ordinary course
of business. The Company is currently not involved in any legal proceedings that it considers probable or reasonably possible, individually
or in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
13.
Leases
The
Company leases approximately 4,160 rentable square feet of office space from an unaffiliated third party for the corporate office located
in Midland, Texas. This includes 702 square feet of office space shared with and paid by our principal shareholder. In June 2024, the
Company agreed to extend its current lease at a flat (unescalated) rate for 36 months. The amended lease now expires on July 31, 2027.
The
Company determines an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right-of-use asset, operating
lease liability, current, and operating lease liability, long-term on the consolidated balance sheet.
Operating
lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate,
the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value
of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate used at adoption was 9%. Significant judgement is required when determining the incremental
borrowing rate. Rent expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The
balance sheet classification of lease assets and liabilities was as follows:

Oil and Gas Reserve Data (Unaudited)
The
estimates of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves, which are located entirely within the United States, were prepared in accordance
with the generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The
estimates as of March 31, 2025 and 2024 were based on evaluations prepared by Russell K. Hall and Associates, Inc. The services provided
by Russell K. Hall and Associates, Inc. are not audits of our reserves but instead consist of complete engineering evaluations of the
respective properties. For more information about their evaluations performed, refer to the copy of their report filed as an exhibit
to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries
are more imprecise than those of currently producing oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change
as additional information becomes available in the future.
The
following table presents the weighted average first-day-of-the-month prices used for oil and gas reserve preparation, based upon SEC
guidelines.

Proved
developed reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells, equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves
(“PUD”) are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells
where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion within five years of the date of their initial recognition. Moreover,
the Company may be required to write down its proved undeveloped reserves if the operators do not drill on the reserves within the required
five-year timeframe. Such downward revisions are primarily attributable to reserves written off due to the five-year limitation and the
change in the timing of new development. The reserves written off were primarily in Lea County, New Mexico due to a change in the timing
of development in wells in which we own a working interest. These interests are held by production and still in place to be developed
in the future.

This figure primarily consists of a projected 72 new wells (296 MBOE) operated by others, 37 wells are planned to be drilled in fiscal
2026, 12 wells in fiscal 2027 and 23 wells in fiscal 2028. The cost of these projects would be funded, to the extent possible, from existing
cash balances, cash flow from operations and bank borrowings. The remainder may be funded through non-core asset sales and/or sales of
our common stock.
The
following table discloses the Company’s progress toward the conversion of PUDs during fiscal 2025.

Estimated
future net cash flows represent an estimate of future net revenues from the production of proved reserves using average prices for 2025
and 2024 along with estimates of the operating costs, production taxes and future development costs necessary to produce such reserves.
No deduction has been made for depreciation, depletion or any indirect costs such as general corporate overhead or interest expense.
Operating
costs and production taxes are estimated based on current costs with respect to producing oil and natural gas properties. Future development
costs including abandonment costs are based on the best estimate of such costs assuming current economic and operating conditions. The
future cash flows estimated to be spent to develop the Company’s share of proved undeveloped properties through March 31, 2028
are $4,011,975.
Income
tax expense is computed based on applying the appropriate statutory tax rate to the excess of future cash inflows less future production
and development costs over the current tax basis of the properties involved, less applicable carryforwards.
The
future net revenue information assumes no escalation of costs or prices, except for oil and natural gas sales made under terms of contracts
which include fixed and determinable escalation. Future costs and prices could significantly vary from current amounts and, accordingly,
revisions in the future could be significant.
F-19
The
current reporting rules require that year end reserve calculations and future cash inflows be based on the 12-month average market prices
for sales of oil and gas on the first calendar day of each month during the fiscal year discounted at 10% per year and assuming continuation
of existing economic conditions. The average prices used for fiscal 2025 were $73.79 per bbl of oil and $2.14 per mcf of natural gas.
The average prices used for fiscal 2024 were $76.88 per bbl of oil and $2.75 per mcf of natural gas.
The
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying the 12-month unweighted average of the first day of
the month pricing for oil and natural gas (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements)
to the estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures (based on year end costs)
to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, discounted using a rate of 10% per year to reflect the estimated timing
of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and
natural gas properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax rate to the difference.
The
basis for this table is the reserve studies prepared by an independent petroleum engineering consultant, which contain imprecise estimates
of quantities and rates of production of reserves. Revisions of previous year estimates can have a significant impact on these results.
Also, exploration costs in one year may lead to significant discoveries in later years and may significantly change previous estimates
of proved reserves and their valuation. Therefore, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is not necessarily indicative
of the fair value of proved oil and gas properties.
The
following information is based on the Company’s best estimate of the required data for the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future
Net Cash Flows as of March 31, 2025 and 2024 in accordance with ASC 932, “Extractive Activities – Oil and Gas” which
requires the use of a 10% discount rate. This information is not the fair market value, nor does it represent the expected present value
of future cash flows of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves.
