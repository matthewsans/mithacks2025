Beneficient
(the “Company”) is filing this Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 with respect to its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (the “Annual Report”). The Company has determined that it is unable to file the
Annual Report within the initially prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense.
As
previously disclosed, on June 19, 2025, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Brad Heppner, resigned, effective immediately,
following a request from the Company’s counsel, acting at the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, for Mr. Heppner to sit for a formal interview regarding, among other things, his knowledge of certain documents and information
concerning Mr. Heppner’s relationship to a related entity provided to the Company’s auditors in 2019, which request Mr. Heppner
refused. As a result, additional time is needed to (i) allow the Company to compile and analyze supporting documentation in order
to complete the Annual Report, (ii) permit the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to complete its audit of
the financial statements included in the Annual Report, and (iii) allow the Company time to identify and appoint an Interim Chief Executive
Officer and provide such person sufficient time to review the Annual Report and complete the required certifications in advance of filing
the Annual Report.
The
Company currently intends to file the Annual Report on or before July 15, 2025.
