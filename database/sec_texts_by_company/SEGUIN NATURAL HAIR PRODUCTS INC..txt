PART I
Item 1. Business
General Overview
We were incorporated on April 29, 2014, under
the laws of the State of Nevada. We originally intended to engage in the business of developing, marketing, and selling shampoo, conditioner,
and other hair care products made from natural ingredients. Initial operations included organization and incorporation, target market
identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. However, we are no longer in the business of developing
and selling shampoo, conditioner, or any other hair care products. We are presently considered a “shell company” and our current
business plan is to seek to acquire a viable ongoing business either by acquisition, merger, or other form of business combination transaction.
In accordance with our current business model, on December 28, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended January
9, 2018 (“Merger Agreement”), with Yuengling’s Ice Cream Corporation, a private Pennsylvania corporation (“Yuengling’s”).
On June 13, 2018, the Company informed Yuengling’s by written notice that the Company has terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated December 28, 2017. The reason for the termination was the failure of Yuengling’s to complete the audit of its financial statements
as required by the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Corporate Facilities
Our administrative and executive offices
located at 50 Yorkville Avenue, Unit 2803, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4W 0A3 which are provided by our Chief Executive Officer
without charge.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company”
as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”) and may take advantage of certain exemptions from
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth
companies” included but not limited to, not being required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation
and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We will remain an “emerging growth company”
until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1.235 billion; (ii) the date on which
we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in a three year period; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year following the
fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,as amended; or (iv) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliated
exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
To the extent we continue to qualify as a “smaller
reporting company”, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after we cease to qualify
as an “emerging growth company”, certain of the exemptions available to us as an “emerging growth company” may
continue to be available to us as “smaller reporting company” including (i) not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures;
and (iii) the requirement to provide only two years of audited consolidated financial statements instead of three.

Item 1A Risk Factors.
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide
the information required by this item.
Item 2. Properties
We do not own any properties at this time and
do not have presently any agreements to acquire any properties.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are not involved in any legal proceedings.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

PART II
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is not currently quoted on any interdealer quotation system, securities exchange or the OTC
Pink inter-dealer quotation service maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc., accordingly, there is presently no active public market
for our common stock.
As of the date of this report, we have 16,843,878 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding held by 17 stockholders of record.
Dividend Policy
To date, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common
stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. It is anticipated that
our future earnings will be retained to finance our continuing development. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance
the exploration and growth of our business, our Board of Directors has the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment
of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems
relevant.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we did not issue any shares of
common or preferred stock.
Item 6. Selected Financial Data.
There is no selected financial data required to be filed for
a smaller reporting company.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion provides information which management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be
read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect
our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like
believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.
You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.
Plan of Operations
At the present time, the Company has no business operations.
The Company will continue to seek other business opportunities either through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company
with ongoing business operations. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had not generated any revenues and had no income or cash flows from
operations since inception. At March 31, 2022, the Company had a sustained net loss of $11,096 and had an accumulated deficit of $306,509.
The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report
raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon these operations successfully generating cash flow for the Company, financial support from its stockholders,
its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of the target company with the Company.
Balance sheet at March 31, 2022 and 2021
Cash
At March 31, 2022 we had cash of $0 compared to $0 as of
March 31, 2021.
Prepaid Assets
At March 31, 2022 we had prepaid expenses of $3,146 compared
to $21,396 as at March 31, 2021.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at March 31, 2022 totaled $277 compared
to $7,431 as at March 31, 2021.
Accrued compensation totaled $17,500 for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 as
the liability relates to service in a prior year period.
Payable to Related Parties
From time to time, the Company has received advances from its
CEO to meet short-term working capital needs. As of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, a total of $78,270 in advances from related parties
are outstanding. These advances are unsecured, bear no interest, and do not have formal repayment terms or arrangements.
Shareholder Advances and Receivable
Shareholder advances represent expenses paid by the owners from
personal funds. The amount of advances at March 31, 2022 was $236 which was the same amount at March 31, 2021.
Income statement for the years ended March 31, 2022
and 2021
Revenues for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
The Company did not have any revenues from any sources in 2022 or 2021 and no revenues
are expected in the near term until the Company locates and completes an acquisition of an operational business.
7
Expenses for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021
Operating expenses decreased from $27,001 as of March 31, 2021
to $11,096 as of March 31, 2022. The decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in professional fees for legal and accounting
services associated with the Company’s financial and periodic reports filed obligations with the SEC.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021
We had nominal assets at both March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
As of March 31, 2022, we had $0 in cash as compared to $0 in cash at March 31, 2021. Total liabilities at March 31, 2022 were $96,283.
At March 31, 2021, liabilities totaled $103,437. Unless our officers/related stockholders continue to advance funds to the Company, of
which there can be no assurance, or the Company receives an infusion of capital, it is unlikely that the Company will continue operations.
At March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $306,509 as compared to $295,413 at March 31, 2021.
Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared
assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an
accumulated deficit at March 31, 2022, a net loss, and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate
sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may never be sufficient to commence and support its daily operations. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise
additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and on its ability to raise additional funds.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc. (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2022, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements,
the Company has an accumulated deficit, net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters.
Critical audit matters are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Note 1 - Organization
Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.
Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc. (the “Company”)
was incorporated on April 29, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Initial operations have included organization and incorporation,
target market identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. A substantial portion of the Company’s
activities has involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace. The Company has generated
no revenues since inception.
We are no longer in the business of developing and selling shampoo,
conditioner, or any other hair care products.
The Company has no operations at this time and currently does
not have any principal products or services, customers, or intellectual property. As the Company has no current operations, it also currently
is not subject to any competitive business conditions. Further, the Company is not subject to any government approvals at this time, other
than those applicable to it as a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
Note 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices
The Management of the Company is responsible for the selection
and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies
and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and require
management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects
of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed
below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Fiscal Year End
The Company elected March 31st as its fiscal year end date upon its formation.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period(s).
Critical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the
nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or
the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material.
The Company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:
(i)Assumption as a going concern: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business;
F-6
Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.
March 31, 2022 and 2021
Notes to the Financial Statements
(ii)Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets: Management assumes that the realization of the Company’s
net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (“NOL”) carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes
that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of
the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred
recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, (d) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of
a public or private offering, among other factors.
These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the
risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions
are difficult to measure or value.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources.
Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions
used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and
reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-
35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad
levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35- 37 are described
below:
Level 1Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included
in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated
by market data.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values
are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption
or input is unobservable.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs
used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets
and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of this instrument.
Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to
be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations
about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Related Parties
The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a.
affiliates of the Company (“Affiliate” means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in
and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required,
absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted
for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that
are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties
with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other
to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties
that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in
one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might
be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
The financial statements shall include disclosures of material
related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of
business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements
is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of
the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income
statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial
statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of
any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties
as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.
Commitment and Contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued,
which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company
assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company
evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought
or expected to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued
in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but
is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range
of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed
unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and,
in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing
GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the
transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision
The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management
concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date.
The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed
or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards.
The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances
as management deems necessary.
Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax
laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates
within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions
for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances
or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
Tax years that remain subject to examination by major
tax jurisdictions
The Company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions
pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share ("EPS") is the amount of earnings
attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed
pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted- average number of common
shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the
dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred
stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net
income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include
the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during
the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement,
stock options or warrants.
F-9
Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.
March 31, 2022 and 2021
Notes to the Financial Statements
Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23
Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The
dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in
diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8
through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees,
stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260–10–55–23). Anti-dilutive contracts,
such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise
of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be
assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from the exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price
during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number
of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.
There were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
Cash Flows Reporting
The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating,
investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect
method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating
activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals
of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items
that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.
Subsequent Events
The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the
date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as
an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting
(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU includes amendments that expand the existing reportable segment
disclosure requirements and requires disclosure of (i) significant expense categories and amounts by reportable segment as well as the
segment’s profit or loss measure(s) that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) to
allocate resources and assess performance; (ii) how the CODM uses each reported segment profit or loss measure to allocate resources and
assess performance; (iii) the nature of other segment balances contributing to reported segment profit or loss that are not captured within
segment revenues or expenses; and (iv) the title and position of the individual or name of the group or committee identified as the CODM.
This guidance requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
The adoption of this guidance will result in the Company being required to include enhanced disclosures relating to its reportable segments.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments
- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the impairment
model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU 2016-13 will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses
expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for
credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January
1, 2023 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements.

Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.
March 31, 2022 and 2021
Notes to the Financial Statements
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016–10 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not
change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of
Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for
those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange
for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use
the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property
(which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended to render more detailed implementation guidance with the
expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company has reviewed the provisions of this
ASU to and determined there will be no material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
The Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued
and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations
or cash flows of the Company.
Note 3 – Going Concern
The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”).
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared
assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at March
31, 2022, a net loss, and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate
sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company
believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability
to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Note 4 – Convertible Notes - Related Party
Debt:
From August 1, 2017, to June 28, 2018, the Company issued various
promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $102,145 of which $11,095 was paid directly to the holder to pay for expenses on
behalf of the Company. These borrowings were from an investor (the “Lender”) who has significant influence over the Company’s
affairs. Interest is 12% to 25% per annum and is payable on demand. For the notes issued between November 14, 2017, and December 4, 2017,
in the event of prepayment, the Borrower will pay to Lender 150% of the unpaid principal amount of the notes. For the remainder of the
notes, there is no penalty for prepayment. These promissory notes have since been modified to include conversion privileges.
Conversion Terms:
The Lender has the right at any time following the 9th anniversary
month of the date of the note, to convert the outstanding and unpaid notes principal and interest due into the Company’s common
shares. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon a conversion hereunder will be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount
by Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock as quoted by OTC Markets Group Inc. for the preceding five (5) trading days immediately
preceding the date of conversion (“Conversion Price”). In no event, however, will the Conversion Price be less than $0.35
per share.

March 31, 2022 and 2021
Notes to the Financial Statements
Conversion of Debt:
In December 2018, in a private transaction, the holder of $102,145
in debt sold these notes to an unrelated investor who subsequently converted the outstanding principal debt to common stock, thereby acquiring
control of the Company. Effective December 4, 2018, the Company issued 8,753,506 shares of its common stock (“Shares”)
upon the exercise of conversion rights under outstanding convertible promissory notes (“Notes”). The conversion price
for the shares was $0.00927 per share and the aggregate principal amount converted under the Notes was $102,145. As a result of the conversion,
the Notes were paid in full and are no longer outstanding obligations of the Company. On December 8th, 2021, the Company issued the additional
2,265,372 shares of common stock for the above conversion. The Shares were issued in compliance with the exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation S for transactions not involving a
public offering and for offers and sales outside the United States.
Note 5 – Equity
Issuance of Additional Shares for Conversion
On December 8, 2021, the Company issued 2,265,372 shares of
common stock it had recorded as Shares to be Issued related to the December 2018 Debt Conversion (See Note 4).
Note 6 – Related Party Transactions
Advances
From time to time, the Company has received advances from its
chief executive officer to meet short-term working capital needs. As of March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, a total of $78,270 in advances
from related parties are outstanding. These advances are unsecured, bear no interest, and do not have formal repayment terms or arrangements.
Free Office Space
The Company has been provided office space by its Chief Executive
Officer at no cost. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statement.
Shareholder Advances
The balance owed to shareholders as of March 31, 2022 and March
31, 2021 was $236. The advances from shareholders are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and payable on demand.
Management Compensation Payable
During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
accrued $0 in compensation to be paid to Management for services rendered. The total compensation payable as of March 31, 2022 and 2021
is $17,500.
Note 7 – Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision
Deferred Tax Assets
At March 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”)
carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes of $305,145 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2037. No tax
benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards because the Company believes that the realization of
the Company’s net deferred tax assets of approximately $64,080 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential
tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.
F-12
Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.
March 31, 2022 and 2021
Notes to the Financial Statements
Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL
carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding the
probability of its realization. The valuation allowance increased approximately $2,616  and
$5,670  for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure
There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on
accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this report.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework or COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2022. Management identified segregation of duties &
maintenance of current accounting records as material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
Management is in the continuous process of improving the internal
control over financial reporting by engaging a Certified Public Accountant as a consultant to mitigate some of the identified weaknesses.
The Company is still in its development stage and intends on bringing in necessary resources to address the weaknesses once full operations
have commenced. Management concludes that internal control over financial reporting is ineffective at March 31, 2022.
Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based
upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls
over financial reporting during its fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
its internal control over financial reporting.

PART III
Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance;
As of the date of this report, the directors and officers of the Company are as follows:
NAME
AGE
POSITIONS AND OFFICES HELD
Danny Iandoli
60
President/CEO and Director
Danny Iandoli is currently the Company’ sole officer and director. He has been
officer and director since December 6, 2018. Mr, Iandoli is the owner of Dicar Financial Incorporated located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada
which is in business of making and holding real estate mortgage loans on residential and commercial property.
Term of Office
Our director is appointed for a one-year term to hold office
until the next annual general meeting of our stockholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers, if
any, are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board. All officers and directors listed above will
remain in office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. There
are no agreements with respect to the election of Directors. We have not compensated our Directors for service on our Board of Directors,
any committee thereof, or reimbursed for expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and/or any committee of
our Board of Directors. Officers are appointed annually by our Board of Directors and each Executive Officer serves at the discretion
of our Board of Directors. We do not have any standing committees. Our Board of Directors may in the future determine to pay Directors’
fees and reimburse Directors for expenses related to their activities.
None of our officers and/or directors have filed any bankruptcy
petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving
the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past five (5) years.
Audit Committee
At the present time, we do not have a standing audit committee
of the Board of Directors. Management has determined not to establish an audit committee at present because our limited resources and
limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. We do not have a financial
expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on management’s belief that the cost of obtaining the services
of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B is beyond its limited financial resources
and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls and procedures
for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting issues raised in its consolidated financial statements
at this stage of its development. We have not formed a Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or any other
Board Committee as of the filing of this Annual Report.
Certain Legal Proceedings
No director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the
Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past five years.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
We are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”)
that applies to our officers, directors and employees including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting
Officer. A copy of the Code will be provided to any person upon request, without charge.
Item 11. Executive Compensation
The Company has not to date paid any compensation to any officer
or director. The Company intends to pay annual salaries to all its officers and will pay an annual stipend to its directors when, and
if, it completes a primary public offering for the sale of securities and/or the Company reaches profitability, experiences positive cash
flow and/or obtains additional funding. At such time, the Company anticipates offering cash and non-cash compensation to officers and
directors. In addition, although not presently offered, the Company anticipates that its officers and directors will be provided with
a group health, vision and dental insurance program at subsidizes rates, or at the sole expense of the Company, as may be determined on
a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. In addition, the Company plans to offer 401(k) matching funds as a retirement
benefit, paid vacation days and paid holidays.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence
Director Independence
Presently, our sole director, Danny Iandoli, is the Company’s
sole officer and as such we have no directors who would qualify as independent as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Our director believes
that retaining one or more additional directors who would qualify as independent would be overly costly, burdensome, and not warranted
in the circumstances given the Company’s current stage of development.
