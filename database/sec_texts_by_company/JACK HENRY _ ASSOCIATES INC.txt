4PART IITEM 1.  BUSINESS Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.® is a well-rounded financial technology company that strengthens connections between financial institutions and the people and businesses they serve. For nearly 50 years, we have provided technology solutions to help banks and credit unions innovate faster, strategically differentiate, and successfully compete while serving the evolving needs of their accountholders. We empower approximately 7,400 financial institutions and diverse corporate entities with people-inspired innovation, personal service, and insight-driven solutions. Mission StatementWe strengthen the connections between people and their financial institutions through technology and services that reduce the barriers to financial health.This mission has always been part of the foundation on which Jack Henry was built. Our founders, Jack Henry and Jerry Hall, were committed to their community and believed they could help financial institutions better serve the needs of their accountholders by using more innovative technology and services. Since our founding in 1976, much has changed, but our commitment to supporting community and regional banks and credit unions remains unwavering. We continue to be guided by our founding philosophy: do the right thing, do whatever it takes, and have fun.Who We ServeWe provide products and services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions (see "Our Industry" below):•Core bank integrated data processing systems are provided to over 950 banks. Our banking solutions support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments with functionality for core processing platforms and integrated complementary solutions.•Core credit union data processing solutions are provided to credit unions of all sizes, with a client base of approximately 715 credit unions. We offer a flagship core processing platform and integrated complementary solutions that support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments.•Non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services are also provided to banks and credit unions. We offer complementary solutions that include highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payment solutions, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile functionality. These products and services enhance the performance of traditional banks and credit unions of all asset sizes and charters, and non-traditional diverse corporate entities. In total, we serve approximately 1,670 bank and credit union core clients and over 5,710 non-core clients.Our products and services provide our clients with solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our well-rounded solutions also enable banks and credit unions to offer the high-demand products and services required by their accountholders to compete more successfully and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry.We are committed to exceeding our clients’ expectations. We measure and monitor their satisfaction using a variety of surveys, such as an annual survey on the client's anniversary date and randomly-generated online surveys initiated each day by routine support requests to ensure feedback is received throughout the year. The survey results are analyzed and provided to operational areas to ensure our service consistently exceeds our clients’ expectations. We believe this process ensures we understand the Voice of the Customer which contributes to our excellent retention rates.We are focused on establishing long-term client relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships. We do so with cross sales of additional products and services that support our clients' strategy, earning new financial and non-financial clients, and ensuring our product offerings are highly competitive.The majority of our support and services revenue is derived from our private and public cloud services for our hosted clients that are typically on a six-year contract, recurring electronic payment solutions that are generally on a contract term of six years, and our on-premise clients that are typically on a one-year contract. Less predictable software license fees, paid by clients implementing our software solutions on-premise, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources. Information regarding the classification of our business into four separate segments is set forth in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements (see Item 8).5We recognize that our associates and their collective contributions are ultimately responsible for Jack Henry's past, present, and future success. Recruiting and retaining high-quality associates is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we believe we have established an organizational culture that sustains high levels of associate engagement. For further discussion of our human capital considerations, see "Human Capital" below.Our Industry Our core banking solutions generally serve commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $55 billion and above in assets and are designed to be capable of serving institutions with up to $150 billion in assets. We complete annual, third-party testing to validate this capability each August. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), there were approximately 4,440 commercial banks and savings institutions in the $55 billion and under asset range as of December 31, 2024, and we currently support over 950 of these banks with one of our three core information processing platforms and a significant number of complementary/payment products and services.  Our core credit union solutions serve credit unions of all asset sizes. According to America's Credit Unions ("ACU") (formerly Credit Union National Association), there were 4,550 domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2024, and we currently support approximately 715 of these credit unions with one flagship core information processing platform and a significant number of complementary/payment products and services.Our non-core solutions serve banks and credit unions of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities. We support these organizations with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs.The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 13% from the end of calendar year 2019 to the end of calendar year 2024, due mainly to mergers and acquisitions. Although the number of banks continued to decline at a 3% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 5% and totaled $24.1 trillion as of December 31, 2024. There were six new bank charters issued in calendar year 2024 and six issued in the 2023 calendar year. Comparing calendar years 2024 to 2023, the number of transactions of FDIC-insured banks acquiring or merging with other banks or credit unions decreased 18%.ACU reports the number of credit unions declined 15% from the end of calendar year 2019 to the end of calendar year 2024. Although the number of credit unions declined at a 3% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 8% and totaled $2.3 trillion as of December 31, 2024.Despite continued industry consolidation, Jack Henry net core footprints increased year-over-year from calendar year 2023 to calendar year 2024 in both bank and credit union client bases. Furthermore, the average assets under management for our banking core clients grew from $1.26 billion to $1.29 billion, and the average assets under management for our credit union core clients grew from $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion.Community and regional banks and credit unions are vitally important to the communities, consumers, and businesses they serve as well as to the local economies where they operate. Bank and credit union accountholders rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the accountholders' delivery channel of choice. Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining accountholders in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near-term and long-term performance goals are often technology dependent. Banks and credit unions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:•Offer digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry.•Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information.•Provide the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry.•Foster growth and efficiency through delivering accountholders exceptional user experiences.•Expand existing accountholder relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services.•Capitalize on new revenue, and deposit and loan portfolio growth opportunities.•Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs. •Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure.•Protect accountholders with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses.•Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments.•Ensure full regulatory compliance.6Jack Henry’s extensive product and service offerings help diverse banks and credit unions meet business challenges and capitalize on opportunities. We strive to get to know our clients, understand their strategies and challenges, and provide innovative solutions that help them achieve short- and long-term success. Business Strategy Our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions. Our strategy for the next three to five years is to enable banks and credit unions to win on exceptional user experience and trust through open, innovative technology, data-driven insights, and service, resulting in greater growth and efficiency. We intend to execute this strategy by:•Providing community and regional banks and credit unions with core processing systems that provide excellent functionality and support on-premise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality.•Expanding each core client relationship by cross-selling complementary/payment products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core processing systems.•Delivering non-core highly specialized core-agnostic complementary/payment products and services to banks and credit unions, including institutions not utilizing one of our core processing systems, and diverse corporate entities.•Developing and deploying a long-term technology modernization strategy to provide public cloud-native solutions that provide clients with greater flexibility, optionality, open integration, speed to market, and other benefits.•Upholding a company-wide commitment to service that consistently exceeds our clients’ expectations and generates high levels of retention.•Carrying out a large client strategy that focuses on deep engagement with banks and credit unions to align objectives, optimize revenue streams, and foster collaborative growth and innovation through continuous engagement and commitment to excellence.•Growing our market share of services to small and medium-sized businesses offering features through banks and credit unions.•Building, maintaining, and enhancing a protected environment and tools that help our clients and Jack Henry protect accountholder data, assets, and comply with regulations.•Maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy.Technology Modernization StrategyOur public cloud-native technology modernization strategy seeks to enable our bank and credit union clients to innovate faster, differentiate themselves in the markets they serve, and meet the evolving needs of their accountholders.The Jack Henry PlatformTM is the centerpiece of this strategy and operates as a single public cloud-native, API-first platform, which we are developing into a fully functional modern alternative for existing core functions. The platform includes services like wire transfers, a centralized data hub for reporting and analysis, exception item processing, general ledger, deposit servicing, and entitlements. These services can be combined with other Jack Henry public cloud-native solutions, such as digital banking, digital payments, and fraud detection, as well as third-party provider solutions on a single, unified platform.The Jack Henry Platform leverages public cloud advantages, including high system availability, rapid processing, modern security standards, easily deployable upgrades, and scalability. Acquisition StrategyWe have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 35 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal year 1999. We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to: •Expand our suite of complementary/payment products and services.•Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core clients as well as outside our core base to new clients.•Accelerate our internal development efforts for technology modernization.•Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry. After nearly 50 years in business, we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues. In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would 7expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our Company without material distractions. We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint, and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our stockholders. While we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our stockholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our clients, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends.Our most recent acquisition was:Fiscal YearCompany or Product NameProducts and Services2023Payrailz, LLC ("Payrailz")Provider of cloud-native modern digital payment capabilities leveraging AI and machine learning features for the financial services industry.Solutions•Our core banking solutions support commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation.

These core systems are available for on-premise installation at client sites, or banks and credit unions can choose to leverage our private cloud environment for ongoing information processing.8Core banking platforms are:•SilverLake System®, a robust system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks that currently serves banks with assets ranging from $1 billion to over $55 billion. Some progressive smaller banks and de novo (start-up) banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by 520 banks, and now serves nearly 12% of the domestic banks in the $55 billion and under asset range.•CIF 20/20®, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports 260 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $6 billion.•Core Director®, a cost-efficient system with point-and-click operation that now supports over 170 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $2 billion.Core credit union platform is:  •Symitar® (formerly known as Episys®), a robust system designed specifically for credit unions. It has been implemented by approximately 715 credit unions with assets ranging from $20 million to $33 billion, and according to National Credit Union Administration ("NCUA") data, is the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other credit union core system.Clients electing to install our solutions on-premise license the proprietary software systems. The majority of these clients pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We re-market the hardware, hardware maintenance, and peripheral equipment that is required by on-premise use of our software solutions; and we perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. On-premise clients generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.Clients can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by on-premise installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by leveraging our private cloud environment for those functions. Our core private cloud services are provided through a highly resilient data center configuration across multiple physical locations. We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country. We print and mail accountholder statements for banks and credit unions from three regional printing and rendering centers. Clients electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for six years that include "per account" fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.We are dedicated to meeting the evolving business needs of our core bank and credit union clients by continuously enhancing each core system, introducing new integrated complementary products regularly, integrating practical new technologies, and adhering to regulatory compliance initiatives. Additionally, we serve as a single point of contact for each core client for support and accountability. Complementary Products and Services  We have a large number of complementary/payment products and services that are targeted to our core banks and
credit unions. Many of these are selectively sold to banks and credit unions that use other core processing systems.These complementary/payment solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving accountholder demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase efficiency, address specific operational needs, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions enable diverse banks, credit unions, and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security, mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs.We regularly introduce new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary/payment solutions from our existing core clients and based on the growing demand among banks, credit unions, and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and/or containing costs. Our Industry Research department solicits client guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. Our new complementary/payment products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.Implementation and TrainingMost of our core bank and credit union clients contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products.A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to client facilities or work remotely with clients to help 9manage the implementation process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the Jack Henry system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our clients. We have a comprehensive training program that supports new clients with basic training and longtime clients with continuing education. The training enables banks and credit unions to maximize the use of our core and complementary solutions, learn about ongoing system enhancements, and understand evolving legislative and regulatory requirements. Support and Services We serve our core clients as a single point of contact and support for the solutions we provide. Our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:•High service standards.•Trained support staff available up to 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.•Assigned account team.•Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology.•Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from competitive platforms. •Highly effective change management and control processes.•Best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience. Most on-premise clients contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for Jack Henry. These support services are typically priced at approximately 20% of the respective product’s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as client assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees typically are billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with proration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the client or Jack Henry gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration.High levels of support are provided to our private cloud clients by the same support infrastructure utilized for on-premise clients. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly private cloud fees.Hardware SystemsOur software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation, and many other hardware providers that allow Jack Henry to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our clients. We currently sell IBM Power Systems™; Lenovo®, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Cisco servers and workstations; Canon®, Digital Check, Epson®, and Panini® check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.Digital Products and ServicesJack Henry Digital provides a unified platform of digital products and services, anchored by the Banno Digital Platform™.

We enhance our core and complementary systems a minimum of once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely client-driven with recommended opportunities formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing client contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our clients and reduce related costs.Research and development expenses (in thousands) for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 were $162,771, $148,256, and $142,678, respectively. We recorded capitalized software (in thousands) in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 of $172,445, $167,175, and $166,120, respectively. Sales and MarketingWe serve established, well-defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sell opportunities.The marketing and sales initiatives within the core business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. Our non-core specialized core-agnostic niche solutions are sold to complement existing technology platforms to banks and credit unions of all asset sizes and charters.Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new clients in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing client relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports sales with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; client newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. We also host an annual national education conference, which provides opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.Jack Henry has sold select products and services outside the United States, primarily in Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada. International sales accounted for less than 1% of Jack Henry’s total revenue in each of fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.CompetitionThe market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, and greater 11financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include culture, service, innovation, strategy, and execution, along with product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility, and ease-of-use. For more than a decade, there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for banks and credit unions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future.Our core solutions compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; Corelation, Inc.; and Finastra. Our non-core specialized solutions compete with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities.Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks  Although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates, consultants, resellers, clients, and
prospects. Access to and distribution of our Company’s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology. Regulatory ComplianceJack Henry maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. Our compliance program is coordinated by a team of qualified compliance professionals with extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, knowledge and understanding of Federal consumer protection regulations, and a thorough working knowledge of Jack Henry and our solutions. These compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements, including discussions on emerging topics with the Federal Banking Agencies (“FBA”), and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations.We have processes in place to inform internal stakeholders of new and revised regulatory requirements. Upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the Company’s development teams through periodic regulatory compliance meetings and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle. We publish newsletters to keep our clients informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations. Periodically, client advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes.Internal audits of our systems, networks, operations, business recovery plans, and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems, processes, plans, and security. The FBA conducts ongoing examinations of the Company and issues Reports of Examination. The Board of Directors provides oversight of these activities through the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee.Government RegulationThe financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. All financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision. Our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our clients, including but not limited to those mandated by federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The compliance of Jack Henry’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the parameters set through the interactive design, the classification of clients, and the manner in which the client utilizes the products and services. Our clients are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we provide solutions that assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services. We cannot predict the impact these regulations, any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future.Jack Henry is not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ("OCC"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the NCUA or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions. However, operating as a service provider to banks and credit unions, Jack Henry’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions, and 12subject to periodic reviews by FBA regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews. Jack Henry is also subject to periodic examinations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which provides supervision and enforcement related to federal consumer financial laws applicable to some products and services offered by our clients.We provide private cloud services through Jack Henry Processing Services™ for banks and EASE Processing Services™ for credit unions. We provide data centers and electronic transaction processing through JHA Card Processing Solutions™, internet banking through NetTeller® and BannoTM online solutions, bill payment through our PayrailzTM Payments Platform, network security monitoring and Hosted Network Solutions ("HNS") through our Gladiator® unit, cloud services through Hosted Partner Services and Enterprise Integration Services, and business recovery services through Centurion Disaster Recovery®.Our private cloud services are subject to examination by FBA regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. These examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including system development, functionality, reliability, and security, as well as disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. Our private cloud services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities on occasion.Human CapitalOur AssociatesAs of June 30, 2025, Jack Henry had approximately 7,240 full-time and part-time associates. Our associates are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no labor-related work stoppages.Talent Attraction and EngagementOur people and culture strategy is focused on attracting, engaging, and retaining associates that are qualified and innovative with future-ready technical skills. We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to considering all qualified candidates for employment.We seek non-traditional talent streams to help identify candidates from underrepresented groups. Our internship attracts college and university students, and our apprenticeship program offers paid training and work for candidates with little to no traditional experience, such as computer coding. Both programs can lead to full-time employment.We are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive workplace where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, and we focus on ensuring all associates feel they belong at Jack Henry. Business Innovation Groups ("BIGs"), which are open to all associates, help us to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging. These groups provide input and suggestions to address business problems and offer education and training to foster inclusion and belonging. As of June 30, 2025, we had over 1,770 unique associates and nearly 2,810 combined associates participating in six active BIGs. A significant portion of the Company’s associates work remotely on either a full-time or hybrid remote/office basis. The Company remains focused on equipping all associates with the tools necessary to effectively communicate, collaborate, and build connections in a remote environment, including ensuring leaders have the skills needed to effectively lead dispersed teams.We seek to actively listen to our associates throughout the year using a defined and continuous listening strategy designed to gather regular feedback on well-being, engagement, leadership, ethics, culture and values, satisfaction, and sense of belonging, through channels such as our annual engagement survey, pulse surveys, skip-a-level interviews, and town halls. This comprehensive strategy allow us to respond to associate concerns, benefit from associate perspectives, and better design and develop processes to support our Company culture. Associates can learn about changes through our internal online news center, regular email communications, monthly Manager Forum events, quarterly associate update videos, or all-associate town hall meetings delivered by senior management.Learning and DevelopmentOur success depends not only on attracting and retaining talented associates, but also in developing our current associates and providing new opportunities for their growth. We offer our associates numerous live and on-demand courses, resources, and training programs to help them build knowledge, improve skills, and develop their career at Jack Henry. Learning opportunities include mandatory courses, as well as recommended content in areas such as leadership development, technical skills, business acumen, innovation, and change management. Jack Tracks, an annual, company-wide virtual learning event, offers associates a large selection of curated topics such as technical and operational readiness, technology trends, company solutions, and industry trends.Recognizing the importance of mentoring in career development, we host an internal mentorship marketplace, which allows prospective mentors and mentees to connect and self-initiate a mentoring relationship. Career mobility 13and personal development resources are available to all associates through dedicated intranet sites including an internal career website where associates can explore new opportunities, register their skills, and view salary ranges. We continue to strengthen our leadership capacity by providing training on effective coaching practices to leaders of the Company.We recognize and value the contribution of our associates who develop, improve, and support our technology solutions. Access to on-demand technical training libraries, customized learning plans, certification programs, and classes facilitated by external experts are available to advance their technical expertise. When there is a critical skill need or where the technology landscape is rapidly changing, we provide unique learning solutions to align associates' development with our strategic initiatives.Wellness and SafetyWe emphasize the safety and well-being of our associates as a top priority. We define wellness holistically and include mental, physical, emotional, financial, psychological, and environmental considerations. Our benefit plan offerings include supportive and dedicated campaigns that communicate directly to associates about financial wellness, mental health, healthful nutrition and exercise, and other wellness topics. Associate well-being is further supported through policies such as remote work, paid parental leave, military service leave, educational assistance, and bereavement leave policies, as well as paid time off, adoption assistance, an employee assistance program, wellness incentives, and paid community volunteer hours.Available InformationJack Henry’s website is easily accessible to the public at jackhenry.com.

RISK FACTORSThe Company's business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired.Business and Operating RisksData security breaches, failures, or other incidents could damage our reputation and business. Our business relies upon receiving, processing, storing, and transmitting sensitive information relating to our operations, associates, and clients. If we fail to maintain a sufficient digital security infrastructure, address security vulnerabilities and new threats, or deploy adequate technologies to secure our systems against attack, we may be subject to security breaches that compromise confidential information, including valuable intellectual property, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, or source code, which could lead to their theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or misappropriation. Such incidents could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, damage our reputation and business, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and expose us to liability. We rely on third parties for various business purposes, and these third parties face similar security risks. A security failure by one of these third parties could expose our data or subject our information systems to interruption of operations and security vulnerabilities. Our information systems rely on hardware, software, and other technological elements, whether developed in-house or provided by third parties, that occasionally need to be patched or updated to address existing or potential security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not remediated in a timely manner, our systems and data may be at risk of compromise or interruption. Our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet. Computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks or other cyber-attacks carried out by cyber criminals or state-sponsored actors. We are continually subject to attempts by unauthorized parties to access confidential information or to destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses, ransomware or malware, and cyber-attacks. The use of artificial intelligence increasingly enabling their sophistication and accelerating their evolution, including through automated phishing and the rapid development of new malware,
which continue to evolve and can be difficult to detect. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce associates, clients, vendors, or other authorized users of our systems through phishing schemes or other social 14engineering methods to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or that of our clients or their accountholders. Any such coordinated attacks, if successful, can lead to data loss and exfiltration, disruption to systems and services, and damage to our reputation as a secure financial technology company.We are also subject to the risk that our associates may, unintentionally or with malicious intent, intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information or that corporate-owned computers used by associates are stolen, or client data media is lost in shipment. An interception, misuse, or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Like other financial institution service providers, we continually face third-party attempts to discover and exploit system weaknesses or to circumvent our security measures. We anticipate that attempts to attack our systems, services, and infrastructure, and those of our clients, third-party service providers and other vendors, will grow in frequency and sophistication. We cannot be certain that our security controls and infrastructure will be adequate to continue to protect our systems and data and our efforts may not be sufficient to combat all current and future technological risks and threats. These risks are further heightened by the fact that a significant portion of our associates and contractors work remotely outside of Company-controlled facilities using networks and devices that are not physically controlled by the Company, potentially limiting the effectiveness of our security controls. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, the use of artificial intelligence, or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate. Security risks may result in liability to our clients or other third parties, damage to our reputation, and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products. The significant amount of capital and other resources we currently expend to protect against the threat of security breaches may prove insufficient to prevent a breach. We cannot ensure that any limitation-of-liability provisions in our client and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors, or other contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims relating to a security breach or similar matters. The insurance coverage we maintain to address data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise, and there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In the event of a security breach, we may need to spend substantial additional capital and resources alleviating problems caused by such breach. Under state, federal, and foreign laws, including those requiring consumer notification of security breaches, the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial. Addressing security problems may result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service to users, any of which could harm our business.Failure to maintain sufficient technological infrastructure or an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims, increase regulatory scrutiny, and cause us to lose clients. Our products and services require substantial investments in technological infrastructure, and we have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our technological infrastructure supports. If we fail to adequately invest in and support our technological infrastructure and processing capacity, we may not be able to support our clients’ processing needs and may be more susceptible to interruptions and delays in services. Damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in processing which could hurt our relationship with clients, damage our reputation, expose us to damage claims, and cause us to incur substantial additional expenses to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment. Events that could cause operational failures include, but are not limited to, hardware and software defects, breakdowns or malfunctions, cybersecurity incidents, human error, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our facilities are also subject to physical risks related to natural disasters or severe weather events, such as tornados, flooding, hurricanes, and heat waves. Climate change may increase the likelihood and severity of such events. Our back-up systems and procedures may prove insufficient or otherwise fail to prevent disruption, such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services. If an interruption extends for more than several hours, we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues due to such interruption. Any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue, have a negative impact on our reputation and the reputation of our clients, result in damage claims, lead our present and potential clients to choose other service providers, and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions, with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs. Implementing modifications and upgrades to our technological infrastructure subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing systems, policies, procedures, and monitoring tools. 15Failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss. The volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow. We direct the settlement of funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses, and consumers, and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks, and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payments, real-time payments through faster payment networks (such as Zelle, RTP, and FedNow), and check clearing that support consumers, financial institutions, and other businesses. If the continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions, we could suffer financial as well as reputational loss. In addition, we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services that we cannot provide ourselves. If we are unable to obtain such services in the future or if the price of such services becomes unsustainable, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may issue short-term credit to consumers, financial institutions, or other businesses as part of the funds settlement process. A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us.Failures of third-party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss. We rely on third-party service providers to support key portions of our operations. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide part, or all, of certain services we deliver to clients. As we continue to move more computing, storage, and processing services out of our data centers and facilities and into third-party hosting environments, our reliance on these providers and their systems will increase. This reliance is further concentrated as we use certain third-party vendors to provide large portions of our hosting needs. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. A failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to our clients. Such a failure could lead to damage claims, loss of clients, and reputational harm, depending on the duration and severity of the failure. Third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, hardware and software defects, breakdowns or malfunctions, cybersecurity incidents, human error, failures in internal controls, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, computer viruses or other malware, natural disasters or severe weather events, or other events. One or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. Certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. If a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products timely and cost-effectively, our clients could be negatively impacted, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business.We operate in a competitive business environment and our business will be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively. We vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all our major product lines. We compete on the basis of product quality, reliability, performance, ease of use, quality of support and services, integration with other products, and pricing. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size, product lines, greater marketing resources, or exclusive intellectual property rights. New competitors, including smaller start-ups, regularly appear with new products, services, and technology for financial institutions. If competitors offer more favorable pricing, payment or other contractual terms, warranties, or functionality, or otherwise attract our clients or prevent us from capturing new clients, we may need to lower prices or offer other terms that negatively impact our results of operations in order to successfully compete. Failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our business. Our contracts with our clients for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of six years. We will continue to experience a significant number of these contracts coming up for renewal each year. Renewal time presents our clients with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us, including reducing the services we provide or negotiating the prices paid for our services. Certain of our renewals have resulted in price compression between the former and renegotiated contracts. If that trend accelerates or becomes more pronounced, it could negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms, revenues and profit margins will suffer. We may experience increased costs for services from our third-party vendors due to inflation or other cost expansion, but because our client contracts typically have longer terms than our vendor contracts, our ability to pass on those higher costs to clients may be limited. If inflation or costs outpace our contractual ability to adjust pricing during the contractual terms of our client contracts, our revenues and profit margins could be negatively impacted.16If we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve, we could lose existing clients and be unable to attract new business. The markets for our products and services are characterized by changing client and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes. These factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services, and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services. Our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services to address the needs of our clients, or if we fail to sell the new or enhanced products and services in which we have invested, we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues, as well as lose prospective sales.The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and generative artificial intelligence into our products introduces significant and evolving risks that could lead to unintended consequences, result in reputational harm, and increased litigation. Our business currently utilizes AI and ML and we continue to evaluate and expand their use, including generative AI, to augment our products and services. While these technologies offer distinct business opportunities, they also bring evolving legal, regulatory, and operational risks. Both state and federal regulations relating to these emerging technologies are quickly and constantly evolving and may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with U.S. laws, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. From an operational standpoint, AI algorithms and training methodologies may create accuracy issues, unintended biases, factual errors, misrepresentations, offensive language, inappropriate statements, or other unexpected outcomes that could undermine product and service quality or lead to errors in our decision-making and solution development. Ineffective or inadequate AI development, testing, evaluation, deployment, content labeling, or governance may impair public acceptance or cause harm, resulting in offerings not working as intended, and we also face explainability risk from our potential inability to interpret or justify AI model decisions, which may lead to concerns about trust, regulatory compliance, and accountability. Additionally, the use of AI tools by associates—whether authorized or not—for internal functions or business operations may result in unintended or unreliable outputs, which could negatively impact the quality, accuracy, or consistency of work product and decision-making. Our failure to accurately identify and address our responsibilities and liabilities in this new environment could negatively affect any solutions we develop incorporating such technology and could subject us to reputational harm, regulatory action, or litigation, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. These same risks apply to our third-party service providers who are implementing these tools into the products or services they provide to us. Any failures to manage and mitigate these risks by these third-party service providers may negatively affect the products and services we provide our clients.Software defects or problems with installations and updates may harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability. Our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects, especially in connection with newly released products and software updates. Software defects may cause interruptions or delays to our services as we attempt to correct the problem. We may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our products on systems used by our clients. Defects in our software, installation problems or delays, or other difficulties could result in negative publicity, loss of revenues, loss of competitive position, or claims against us by clients. In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. If patches or updates are not properly tested prior to installation, or are not properly installed, our systems and data may be at risk of compromise or interruption as a result of such failures.Expansion of services to non-traditional clients could expose us to new risks. We have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional, regulated, and litigation-averse base of financial institution clients. These non-regulated clients may entail greater operational, credit, and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs.Regulatory and Compliance RisksThe software and services we provide to our clients are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business, increase costs, or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations. The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. As a supplier of software and services to financial institutions, portions of our operations are subject to ongoing supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Credit Union Association, among other regulatory agencies. These agencies regulate services we provide and the way we operate, and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable federal and state laws and regulations. We are routinely subject to the examination process with such regulators, which includes the identification of areas where we can improve our practices to better comply with the applicable regulations and guidelines. If regulators 17identify significant issues, or if we fail to meet supervisory remediation expectations, we could be subject to regulatory actions that could harm our client relationships and reputation. Failure by third parties, with whom we contract or partner, to comply with regulations or guidelines could also harm our relationships and reputation. Such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain clients and obtain new clients.In addition, existing laws, regulations, and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion. New regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel. Our clients are also regulated entities, and actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions. We will be required to apply substantial research and development and other corporate resources to adapt our products to this evolving, complex, and often unpredictable regulatory environment. Our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our clients, for which we may bear ultimate liability.Compliance with new and existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and rules may adversely impact our expenses, development, and strategy. We are subject to complex laws, rules, and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we could be subject to reputational harm, regulatory enforcement, and litigation. The use, confidentiality, and security of private client information is under increased scrutiny. Regulatory agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and foreign regulatory and governmental bodies are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined. The number of state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations has grown tremendously over the past several years, resulting in an increasingly complex and fragmented regulatory landscape. These laws often include industry-specific requirements and board consumer data protection obligations. While many of these frameworks share common principles each jurisdiction imposes unique compliance standards, definitions, and obligations that may not align with one another. This lack of uniformity, combined with frequent legislative updates and regulatory amendments, creates ongoing challenges for organizations seeking to maintain consistent and compliant data governance practices across multiple jurisdictions. Further, the FTC and state attorneys general may interpret federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. In addition, compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to our technology and our internal processes and procedures, including the way that we handle, process, and store data, which could divert company resources and negatively impact growth opportunities. We will also be affected by these regulations as a third-party provider to clients who are subject to such regulations and will seek our assistance in their compliance efforts. Failure to comply or readily address compliance and regulatory rule changes made by payment card networks could adversely affect our business. We are subject to card association and network compliance rules governing the payment networks we serve, including Visa, MasterCard, Zelle, FedNow, and The Clearing House’s RTP network, and all rules governing the Payment Card Data Security Standards. If we fail to comply with these rules and standards, we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated, which could limit our ability to service our clients and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations. Changes made by the networks, even when complied with, may result in reduction in revenues and increased costs of operations.Economic Conditions RisksNatural disasters, public health crises, wars, acts of terrorism, other armed conflict, and workforce shortages could adversely affect our results of operations. The occurrence of, or threat of, natural disasters, widespread public health crises, political unrest, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts involving the United States or foreign countries, or general workforce shortages can result in significant economic disruptions and uncertainties and could adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition. The conditions caused by such events may affect the rate of spending by our clients and their ability to pay for our products and services, delay prospective clients’ purchasing decisions, interfere with our associates’ ability to support our business function, disrupt the ability of third-party providers we rely upon to deliver services, adversely impact our ability to provide on-site services or installations to our clients, or reduce the number of transactions we process, all of which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position. We are unable to accurately predict the impact of such events on our business due to a number of uncertainties, including the duration, severity, geographic reach and governmental responses to such events, the impact on our clients’ and vendors' operations, and our ability to continue to provide products and services, including the ability of our associates
to work remotely. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.18Our business may be adversely impacted by general U.S. and global market and economic conditions or specific conditions in the financial services industry. We derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. If the general economic environment worsens, including if inflation or interest rates continue to increase or remain at higher than recent historical levels, or if conditions or regulatory requirements within the financial services industry change—such as if financial institutions are required to increase reserve amounts, become subject to new regulatory assessments, or if tariffs or other trade restrictions are imposed or increased—clients may be less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services, and we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending. Deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending, resulting in reduced transaction volumes and our related revenues.Consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Our primary market consists of approximately 4,440 commercial and savings banks and more than 4,550 credit unions. The number of commercial banks and credit unions in the United States has experienced a steady decrease over recent decades due to mergers and acquisitions and financial failures and we expect this trend to continue as more consolidation occurs. Such events may reduce the number of our current and potential clients, which could negatively impact our results of operations. A client who merges with, or is acquired by, an entity that is not our client, or a client that is closed by regulatory action, can lead to a reduction or loss of services and negatively impact our results of operation.Acquisition RisksOur growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions. We have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses, products, and services. This strategy depends on our ability to identify, negotiate, and finance suitable acquisitions. Merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions. If we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.Acquisitions subject us to risks and may be costly and difficult to integrate. Acquisitions are difficult to evaluate, and our due diligence may not identify all potential liabilities or valuation issues. We may also be subject to risks related to cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities of the acquired company and the acquired systems. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies. We may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses, including: financial control and computer system compatibility; unanticipated costs and liabilities; unanticipated quality or client problems with acquired products or services; differing regulatory and industry standards; diversion of management's attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and clients; loss of key associates; and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets. To finance future acquisitions, we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public. If we fail to integrate our acquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets.Intellectual Property RisksIf others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes. We have agreed to indemnify many of our clients against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others. We also use certain open- source software in our products, which may subject us to suits by persons claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software. Infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services. Such claims, whether with or without merit, are time-consuming, may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us. If our defense of such claims is not successful, we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications.Our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary systems and technology. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or access systems or technology that we consider proprietary. We actively take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including entering into agreements with users of our services for that purpose and maintaining security measures. However, these steps may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and misappropriation or litigation relating to such matters could have a material negative effect on our results of operation. 19General Risk FactorsA material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud. If material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.The loss of key associates and difficulties in hiring and retaining associates could adversely affect our business. We depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key associates. Our Company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals. If we lose one or more of our key associates, we could suffer a loss of managerial experience, and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. We continue to face a competitive market for hiring and retaining skilled associates. Difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled associates may restrict our ability to adequately support our business needs and/or result in increased personnel costs. These challenges are further compounded by the fact that a substantial portion of our workforce operate in hybrid or fully remote arrangements, which introduces additional complexities related to employee engagement, collaboration, training, and the preservation of corporate culture. As we navigate these dynamics, there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to maintain the Company’s strategic direction.Unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense. Our income tax positions result in a significant net deferred income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Unfavorable future tax law changes, including increasing U.S. corporate tax rates, could increase this net liability and negatively impact our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flow.The impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations. Our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets as of June 30, 2025. On an annual basis, and whenever circumstances require, we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. If the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results.
Changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs or result in decreased interest income. Although our debt borrowing levels have historically been low, we may require additional or increased borrowings in the future under existing or new debt facilities to support operations, finance acquisitions, or fund stock repurchases. Our current credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates on variable-rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Conversely, if interest rates substantially decrease, we would collect less interest income on settlement accounts.ITEM 1B.   UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C.   CYBERSECURITYCyber Risk Management and Strategy In today's interconnected environment, information is inherently exposed to a wide range of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. As a provider of products and services to financial institutions, Jack Henry integrates industry-standard frameworks, policies, and procedures to securely process and store sensitive information, prioritizing the protection of our associates, clients, and their private data in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Jack Henry’s information and cybersecurity program is a core component of our overall enterprise risk management framework. It is maintained by a team of highly skilled cybersecurity professionals and supported by investments in modern technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The program is designed to safeguard Jack Henry and client confidentiality and privacy by systematically identifying, assessing, and managing material risks and cybersecurity threats through comprehensive cyber defense, threat and vulnerability management, and cyber intelligence. It includes continuous enterprise monitoring and well-defined and regularly tested business 20resilience and incident response procedures. We also engage third-party vendors and consultants to assist in identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. Jack Henry systems and services are subject to regular reviews by the same regulatory agencies that oversee financial institutions, including the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”), FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), NCUA, and the CFPB, among others. These reviews, including those conducted by the Federal Banking Agencies (comprised of the FDIC, FRB, and the OCC) help identify potential security gaps or control deficiencies. In addition, critical services provided to our clients undergo annual System and Organization Controls (“SOC”) reviews by independent auditors.Our associates and contractors play a vital role in the safeguarding of systems and data. All are required to complete annual security awareness training to ensure they stay current on best practices and emerging cyber threats. We also conduct routine phishing exercises to help associates and contractors recognize and appropriately respond to suspicious emails. Supplemental training is provided throughout the year to individuals and teams with elevated-risk profiles.Jack Henry relies on third-party service providers to deliver certain services and products to our clients. We evaluate and seek to mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these providers through pre-engagement and periodic risk assessments to ensure our standards for security are maintained. Our strategic risk management committees review and address any identified risks. In fiscal year 2025, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats, including those arising from prior incidents, that materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. As a large financial technology provider, we continually face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our efforts to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience a material cybersecurity incident in the future or that an undetected incident has not already occurred. For further discussion of cybersecurity risks, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.CyberSecurity Governance and OversightOur Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of risk management and has delegated responsibility for enterprise and operational risks, including cybersecurity, to the Board’s Risk and Compliance Committee. This Committee oversees Jack Henry’s risk assessment and management programs and reviews risk preparedness. The Audit Committee oversees financial risks and would be informed of any material cybersecurity incident that could potentially have a material impact on our financial statements. The Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) reports quarterly to the Risk and Compliance Committee and to the full Board of Directors on information security matters. The CISO also meets with the Risk and Compliance Committee at least annually to evaluate our overall security environment and organization. While the Board of Directors, through the Risk and Compliance Committee, maintains oversight of cybersecurity risks, management is primarily responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing these risks within our broader risk management program. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee, composed of senior executives, monitors governance, risk, and compliance enterprise-wide, including cybersecurity. Management has adopted specific policies and procedures to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity threats including an incident response program, led by the CISO and staffed by professionals with diverse expertise. Incidents meeting pre-established thresholds are escalated to management for threat assessment, mitigation, remediation, and, if necessary, disclosure to clients, third-parties, and regulators.Our CISO, who reports to the Chief Operations Officer, has primary responsibility for Jack Henry’s information security strategy, policy, security engineering, operations, and cybersecurity threat detection and response. Our CISO brings more than 20 years experience in technology and cybersecurity, including senior leadership roles at major financial institutions. Under the CISO's direction, the information security team continuously monitors cybersecurity trends and implements proactive and defensive measures to protect against cybersecurity threats.ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES We own 154 acres located in Monett, Missouri on which we maintain eight office buildings, plus shipping and receiving, security, and maintenance buildings. We also own buildings in Allen, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Lenexa, Kansas; Angola, Indiana; Shawnee Mission, Kansas; and Springfield, Missouri. Our owned facilities represent approximately 795,000 square feet of office space in five states. We have 17 leased office facilities in 13 states, which total approximately 445,000 square feet. Of this total, approximately 54,700 square feet relates to our 21Elizabethtown, Kentucky leased office facility of which approximately 50,900 square feet is subleased. The remaining owned and leased office facilities are for normal business purposes.We own five aircraft. Many of our clients are located in communities that do not have an easily accessible commercial airline service. We primarily use our aircraft in connection with implementation, sales of systems and internal requirements for day-to-day operations. Transportation costs for implementation and other client services are billed to our clients. We lease property, including real estate and related facilities, at the Monett, Missouri regional airport.ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe are subject to various routine legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management, any liabilities resulting from current lawsuits are not expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case or proceeding.ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURESNone.22Table of ContentsPART IIITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESThe Company's common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “JKHY."

ITEM 6.   [RESERVED]24Table of ContentsITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides management's view of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes included elsewhere in this report. All dollar and share amounts, except per share amounts, are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2024. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.OVERVIEWJack Henry & Associates, Inc. is a well-rounded financial technology company headquartered in Monett, Missouri, that employs approximately 7,240 full-time and part-time associates nationwide, and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions. Our solutions serve approximately 7,400 clients and consist of integrated data processing systems solutions to banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets up to $55 billion, core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, and non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services that enable banks and credit unions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. Our integrated solutions are available for on-premise installation and delivery in our private and public cloud.Each of our solutions shares the fundamental commitment to provide high-quality business systems, service levels that consistently exceed client expectations, and integration of solutions and practical new technologies. The quality of our solutions, our high service standards, and the fundamental way we do business typically foster long-term client relationships, attract prospective clients, and have enabled us to capture substantial market share. Through internal product development, disciplined acquisitions, and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions, we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new cross-sales opportunities. We provide compatible computer hardware for our on-premise installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced solutions in our private and public cloud. We perform data conversions, software implementations, initial and ongoing client training, and ongoing client support services. We believe our primary competitive advantage is client service. Our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels that generate high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We consistently measure client satisfaction using a variety of surveys, such as an annual survey on the client's anniversary date and randomly-generated surveys initiated each day by routine support requests. Dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our client experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.Our two primary revenue streams are "services and support" and "processing." Services and support includes: "private and public cloud" revenues that predominantly have contract terms of six years at inception; "product delivery and services" revenues, which include revenues from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversions, consulting, and hardware; and "on-premise support" revenues, composed of maintenance fees that primarily contain annual contract terms. Processing includes: "remittance" revenues from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; "card" revenues, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and "transaction and digital" revenues, which include transaction and mobile processing revenues. We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.We have four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The respective segments include all related revenues along with the related cost of revenue.A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows.25Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSFISCAL 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2024In fiscal 2025, total revenue increased 7.2% or $159,745, compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total revenue for deconversion revenue of $33,905 in the current fiscal year and $16,554 in the prior fiscal year, results in a 6.5% increase, or $142,394. This increase was mainly driven by growth in data processing and hosting within cloud revenue as new clients were added and volumes expanded, card processing revenue primarily from expanded fraud detection and prevention risk management services and monthly service fees, digital revenue as active monthly users and volumes increased, and payment processing revenue from expanding volumes and new client revenue.Operating expenses increased 4.7%, or $80,421, in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total operating expenses for deconversion costs of $6,242 in the current fiscal year and $3,408 in the prior fiscal year and for VEDIP related costs of $16,443 in the prior fiscal year, results in a 5.5% increase, or $94,031 (The VEDIP program was a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible associates who chose to participate in the program from July through December 2023, including immaterial payments that continued into calendar 2024). The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher direct costs generally commensurate with increases in the related lines of revenue, higher personnel costs including increases in compensation costs during the trailing twelve months, and higher internal licenses and fees from price increases and more deployments in the current fiscal year.As we move into fiscal 2026 – our 50th year in business – we are excited and confident about our future, and we remain well-positioned to deliver durable, consistent growth and attractive results for our shareholders. Technology spending by financial institutions remains strong, and there is clear demand for our differentiated and innovative technology solutions. We have a very healthy sales pipeline and a proven ability to attract and win deals, especially with larger financial institutions. Our unwavering focus on culture, service, innovation, strategy, and execution continues to set us apart in the market and will enable us to drive continued industry-leading revenue growth with strong margin expansion, benefiting our associates, clients, and shareholders.A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 follows.REVENUEServices and Support RevenueYear Ended June 30,% Change 20252024Services and support$1,361,737 $1,275,954 6.7%Percentage of total revenue57%58% Services and support includes: "private and public cloud" fees, which predominantly have contract terms of six years at inception; "product delivery and services" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversion fees, consulting, and hardware; and "on-premise support" revenue, which is composed primarily of maintenance fees with annual contract terms. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, services and support revenue increased 6.7% compared to the prior fiscal year. Reducing total services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for each year, which totaled $33,905 in fiscal 2025 and $16,554 in fiscal 2024, services and support revenue grew 5.4%. This increase was primarily driven by higher data processing and hosting within cloud revenue as new clients were added and volumes expanded and increased consulting, work order, and release revenues, partially offset by the decrease in license and hardware revenues, year over year.Processing RevenueYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Processing$1,013,551 $939,589 7.9%Percentage of total revenue43%42% Processing revenue includes: "remittance" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; "card" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and "transaction and digital" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile processing fees.26Table of ContentsProcessing revenue increased 7.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This increase was driven by growth in card from expanded fraud detection and prevention risk management services and monthly service fees, digital revenue as active monthly users and volumes increased, and payment processing revenue from expanding volumes and new client revenue.OPERATING EXPENSESCost of RevenueYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Cost of revenue$1,360,747 $1,299,477 4.7%Percentage of total revenue57%59% Cost of revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 4.7% compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total cost of revenue for deconversion costs of $3,517 in the current fiscal year and $2,231 in the prior fiscal year results in a 4.6% increase. This increase was driven by higher direct costs consistent with increases in the related revenue and higher personnel costs including increases in compensation costs during the trailing twelve months. Cost of revenue decreased 2% as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.Research and DevelopmentYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Research and development$162,771 $148,256 9.8%Percentage of total revenue7%7% We devote significant effort and expense to develop new software and service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings. We believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly client driven.Research and development expenses for fiscal 2025 increased 9.8% compared to fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs including increased compensation costs and employee headcount additions in the trailing twelve months and internal license and fees expenses from price increases and more deployments in the current fiscal year. The increase in this expense category for the current fiscal year reflects our continuing commitment to the development of strategic products. Research and development expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2025 increased 1.7% compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total selling, general, and administrative expense for deconversion costs from each year, which totaled $2,725 in fiscal 2025 and $1,177 in fiscal 2024 and VEDIP program expenses of $16,443 in the prior fiscal year, results in a 7.5% increase. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs, excluding severance, including increased compensation and employee headcount additions in the trailing twelve months, increased travel expenses, and higher contract labor, partially offset by the gain on the sale of assets in the current fiscal year compared to the loss on the sale of assets last fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 1% as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.27Table of ContentsINTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSEYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Interest income$27,759 $25,012 11.0%Interest expense$(10,438)$(16,384)(36.3)%Interest income increased over the prior fiscal year due to increased interest earned on balances fiscal year over fiscal year. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2025 mainly due to the timing and amounts of borrowed and repaid balances ending the current fiscal year with no remaining debt outstanding.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Provision for income taxes$130,288 $116,203 12.1%Effective rate22.2%23.3%The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was the result of differences in the change in uncertain tax positions between the two periods as well as a favorable state law change in the current fiscal year.NET INCOMEYear Ended June 30,%Change 20252024Net income$455,748 $381,816 19.4%Diluted earnings per share$6.24 $5.23 19.3%Net income grew 19.4% to $455,748, or $6.24 per diluted share, in fiscal 2025 from $381,816, or $5.23 per diluted share, in fiscal 2024. The diluted earnings per share increase fiscal year over fiscal year was 19.3%. This increase was primarily due to organic growth in our lines of revenue and the decrease in one-time severance expenses related to VEDIP fiscal year over fiscal year, partially offset by higher operating expenses in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 .REPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONThe Company is a well-rounded financial technology company and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions.
The Company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other.
The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized accountholder information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, ACH origination and remote deposit capture processing, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms, and services, including digital/mobile banking, treasury services, online account opening, fraud/anti-money laundering ("AML") and lending/deposit solutions that can be integrated with the Company's Core solutions, and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating expenses not directly attributable to the other three segments.The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast. Only revenue and costs of revenue are considered in the evaluation for each segment. 28Table of ContentsImmaterial adjustments between segments were made in fiscal 2025 to reclassify cost of revenue that was recognized in fiscal years 2024 and 2023. These reclasses were made to be consistent with the current allocation of cost of revenue by segment. Cost of revenue reclassed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, from Complementary to Corporate and Other, was $4,922. Cost of revenue reclassed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, from Core and Complementary to Corporate and Other, was $64 and $5,206, respectively.Core 2025% Change2024Revenue$739,277 7.0%$690,738 Cost of Revenue$297,372 3.5%$287,349 In fiscal 2025, revenue in the Core segment increased 7.0% compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Core revenue by deconversion revenue from both fiscal years, which totaled $14,765 in fiscal 2025 and $7,292 in fiscal 2024, Core segment revenue increased 6.0%. This increase was primarily driven by organic increases in our data processing and hosting revenue within cloud. Cost of revenue in the Core segment increased 3.5% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Core cost of revenue by deconversion costs from both fiscal years, which totaled $2,096 in fiscal 2025 and $1,065 in fiscal 2024, Core segment cost of revenue increased 3.1%. This increase was primarily due to increased direct costs associated with the organic growth in cloud revenue. Core segment cost of revenue decreased 1% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.Payments 2025% Change2024Revenue$873,498 6.8%$817,708 Cost of Revenue$460,151 4.1%$442,084 In fiscal 2025, revenue in the Payments segment increased 6.8% compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Payments revenue by deconversion revenue from both fiscal years, which totaled $11,159 in fiscal 2025 and $5,836 in fiscal 2024, Payments segment revenue increased 6.2%. This increase was primarily driven by growth within card revenue and payment processing within remittance revenue. Cost of revenue in the Payments segment increased 4.1% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to increased direct costs related to growth in the card and remittance revenue lines, increased personnel costs including higher compensation costs in the trailing twelve months, and increased internal licenses and fees expense from more deployments and pricing in the current fiscal year. Deconversion and/or severance costs did not significantly affect the Payments segment cost of revenue fiscal year over fiscal year. Payments segment cost of revenue decreased 1% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.Complementary 2025% Change2024Revenue$675,209 9.2%$618,211 Cost of Revenue$264,823 5.5%$251,085 Revenue in the Complementary segment increased 9.2% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Complementary revenue by deconversion revenue from both fiscal years, which totaled $7,709 in fiscal 2025 and $3,217 in fiscal 2024, Complementary segment revenue increased 8.5%. This increase was primarily driven by organic increases in hosting and digital revenues within cloud and higher maintenance fee revenue. Cost of revenue in the Complementary segment increased 5.5% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Complementary cost of revenue by deconversion costs from both fiscal years, which totaled $1,119 in fiscal 2025 and $903 in fiscal 2024, Complementary segment cost of revenue increased 5.4%. This increase was primarily due to higher direct costs related to the organic growth in the digital and hosting within cloud revenue lines, increased personnel costs including higher compensation costs in the trailing twelve months, and higher amortization of capitalized software. Complementary segment cost of revenue decreased 1% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.29Table of ContentsCorporate and Other 2025% Change2024Revenue$87,304 (1.8)%$88,886 Cost of Revenue$338,401 6.1%$318,959 Revenue in the Corporate and Other segment decreased 1.8% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Reducing total Corporate and Other revenue by deconversion revenue from both fiscal years, which totaled $272 in fiscal 2025 and $209 in fiscal 2024, Corporate and Other segment revenue decreased 1.9%. This decrease was mainly due to decreased hardware revenue, partially offset by increased processing fee revenue and software usage and subscription revenues within support.Cost of revenue for the Corporate and Other segment includes operating expenses not directly attributable to any of the other three segments and increased 6.1% for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily related to higher direct costs, increased personnel costs including increased compensation costs and employee headcount additions in the trailing twelve months, and higher cloud consumption costs. Deconversion and/or severance costs did not significantly affect Corporate and Other cost of revenue fiscal year over fiscal year.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company's cash and cash equivalents increased to $101,953 at June 30, 2025, from $38,284 at June 30, 2024.

These expenditures were partially offset by $7,097 of net cash inflow related to stock-based compensation.30Table of ContentsCapital Requirements and ResourcesThe Company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaling $53,358 and $58,118 for fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2024, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. These additions were funded from cash generated by operations. At June 30, 2025, the Company had $58,182 of significant outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment. We assessed our liquidity needs throughout fiscal 2025, and determined we had adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated funding needs. We will continue to monitor and assess these needs going forward.At June 30, 2025, the Company had contractual obligations of $1,700,611, including operating lease obligations, and $1,643,789 related to off-balance sheet contractual purchase obligations. Included in off-balance sheet contractual purchase obligations was the strategic services agreement that offers full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to our customers. This agreement was signed in fiscal 2017 and amended in May 2025 to add two additional service years and $213,053 to contractual obligations, bringing the total remaining purchase commitment at June 30, 2025 to $1,022,283 over the remaining term of the contract, which now extends to January 2038, subject to certain renewal terms. Contractual obligations exclude $22,649 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.On July 4, 2025, the President of the United States signed into law legislation referred to as “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R. 1), which enacts substantial changes to the federal income tax law. The legislation includes several business-focused provisions, such as the restoration of immediate expensing for domestic research and development expenditures and the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025. The Act also permanently extends key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). As the legislation was enacted after the June 30, 2025, balance sheet date, the financial implications are not included in the current fiscal year's financial statements. The Company is in the process of assessing the impacts of the new law and plans to incorporate updates in the financial results next fiscal year beginning in the quarter ending September 30, 2025.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock.

The significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) 32Table of Contentsthe impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from data processing, transaction processing, software licensing and related services, professional services, and hardware sales.Identification of performance obligationsWe enter into contracts with clients that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception,
we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with clients and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the client a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct — that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the client can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the client.Determination of transaction priceThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the client. Our contracts with our clients frequently contain some component of variable consideration. We estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of client contracts that are long-term and include varying transactional volumes.Allocation of transaction priceThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.Contract costsWe incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with clients that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and client conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.Capitalization of software development costsWe capitalize certain costs incurred for use in our cloud-based services and to develop commercial software products. For internal use software, capitalization begins at the beginning of application development. Costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred. Significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful lifeFor software that is to be sold, significant areas of judgment include: establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized, determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.33Table of ContentsPurchase accountingWe account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as computer software and client-related intangibles. Third-party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecast revenues or profits on contract-related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired.ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to clients. We do not currently use any derivative financial instruments. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management.Based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the client base, we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our clients will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of June 30, 2025 and are therefore not currently exposed to interest rate risk.ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAIndex to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm35   Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting37   Financial Statements     Consolidated Statements of Income,  Years Ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 202338    Consolidated Balance Sheets, June 30, 2025, and 202439 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity,  Years Ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 202340    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,  Years Ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 202341    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements42Financial Statement SchedulesThere are no schedules included because they are not applicable, or the required information is shown in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.34Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.35Table of ContentsCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - estimating variable consideration As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded revenue of $2.375 billion for the year ended June 30, 2025. The Company enters into contracts with its clients that may include multiple types of goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the client. The Company’s contracts with its clients frequently contain some component of variable consideration. Management estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. At contract inception, management assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with clients and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the client a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the client can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the client. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of client contracts that are long-term and include varying transactional volumes. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the estimation of variable consideration is a critical audit matter are significant judgment by management to estimate the variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity. This in turn resulted in a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing our audit procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including the estimation of variable consideration. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for determining the variable consideration and testing the reasonableness of management’s estimation of variable consideration. Testing the estimation of variable consideration included evaluating the terms and conditions of the long-term contracts and the related significant assumptions used in the estimate of the variable consideration, principally, the use of historical transaction volumes to estimate the varying volume of transactional activity. The procedures for testing variable consideration included evaluation of the terms and conditions for a sample of contracts./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Kansas City, MissouriAugust 25, 2025We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015. 36Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGThe management of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(e). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures pertaining to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even where internal control over financial reporting is determined to be effective, it can provide only reasonable assurance. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As of June 30, 2025, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on this assessment, management has concluded the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, was effective.The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in this Item 8.37Table of ContentsJACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)NOTE 1.    NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESDESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYJack Henry & Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Jack Henry" or the "Company") is a well-rounded financial technology company. Jack Henry was founded in 1976 as a provider of core processing solutions for banks. Today, the Company’s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for approximately 7,400 banks, credit unions, and diverse corporate entities.
CONSOLIDATIONThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Jack Henry and all its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned, and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.REVENUE RECOGNITIONThe Company generates "Services and Support" revenue through software licensing and related services, private cloud core and complementary software solutions, professional services, and hardware sales. The Company generates "Processing" revenue through processing of remittance transactions, card transactions and monthly fees, and digital transactions.Identification of performance obligationsThe Company enters into contracts with clients that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with clients and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the client a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the client can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations.Determination of transaction priceThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the client. The Company’s contracts with its clients frequently contain some component of variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of client contracts that are long-term and include varying transactional volumes.Allocation of transaction priceThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTThe Company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the point at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability. Software development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product basis annually for impairment and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type of product, market characteristics, and maturity of the market for that particular product. These costs are amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product or on a straight-line basis, whichever yields greater amortization expense.42Table of ContentsThe Company capitalizes development costs for internal use software beginning at the start of application development. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life. All of the above amortization expense is included within components of operating income, primarily cost of revenue. Capitalized development costs for software to be sold and internal use software are included within computer software, net of amortization in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. CASH EQUIVALENTSThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEReceivables are recorded at the time of billing. The Company monitors trade and other receivable balances and contract assets and estimates the allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Estimates of expected credit losses are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events.The following table summarizes allowance for credit losses activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024:Year Ended June 30,20252024Allowance for credit losses - beginning balance$7,477 $7,955 Current provision for expected credit losses2,320 1,920 Write-offs charged against allowance(2,977)(2,209)Other(161)(189)Allowance for credit losses - ending balance$6,659 $7,477 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.Intangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. The amounts are amortized, with the exception of those with an indefinite life (goodwill), over an estimated economic benefit period, generally three to twenty years.The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment of value on an annual basis as of January 1 and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset might be impaired.PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTSAt June 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company had $25,750 in non-current investments. These investments were recorded at cost and are included within other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these investments have not been estimated, as estimation is not practicable due to limited investors which reduces available comparative information. There have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment and no price changes resulting from observing similar or identical investments. An impairment and/or an observable price change would be an adjustment to recorded cost. Fair values will not be estimated unless there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair values of the investments. Equity transactions are monitored quarterly to assess whether there are indicators that fair value may be below carrying value.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, equals the Company’s net income.43Table of ContentsREPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATIONIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's operations are classified as four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other (see Note 14). Substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the United States of America.COMMON STOCKThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. At June 30, 2025, there were 31,580 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3,411 additional shares of its common stock. The total cost of treasury shares at June 30, 2025, was $1,895,224.
During fiscal 2025, the Company repurchased 207 shares of its common stock for $35,051 to be held in treasury. At June 30, 2024, there were 31,373 shares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to 3,618 additional shares of its common stock.EARNINGS PER SHAREPer share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options, restricted stock units, and performance units have been included in the calculation of income per diluted share to the extent they are dilutive. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance units (see Note 11).  INCOME TAXESDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense are recognized on the full amount of unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting GuidanceIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves the disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this ASU effective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, with retrospective application of the additional segment information for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. Additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Not Adopted at Fiscal Year EndIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU requires additional disclosure related to rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and other disclosures to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.44Table of ContentsIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires more detailed disclosures of certain categories of expenses such as employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization that are components of existing expense captions presented on the face of the consolidated statements of income. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.NOTE 2.    REVENUE AND DEFERRED COSTSRevenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenue from data processing, transaction processing, software licensing and related services, professional services, and hardware sales.The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the client.The following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenue:ProcessingProcessing revenue is generated from transaction-based fees for electronic deposit and payment services, electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed.
Clients are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right.Private and public cloudPrivate and public cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Data and item processing services are typically billed monthly. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price.Product delivery and servicesProduct delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery. Software licenses, along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct, are recognized as they are delivered to the client. Hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery. Professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed. Deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification. Therefore, the Company recognizes these fees over the remaining modified contract term. On-premise supportOn-premise support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage, which includes a license and ongoing client support. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services). Software maintenance fees are typically billed to the client annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Software usage is typically billed annually in advance, with the license delivered and recognized at the outset, and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Accordingly, the Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less.45Table of ContentsTaxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. The Company includes reimbursements from clients for expenses incurred in providing services (such as for postage, travel and telecommunications costs) in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.Disaggregation of RevenueThe tables below present the Company's revenue disaggregated by type of revenue. Refer to Note 14 – Reportable Segment Information for disaggregated revenue by type and reportable segment. The majority of the Company’s revenue is earned domestically, with revenue from clients outside the United States comprising less than 1% of total revenue.Year Ended June 30,202520242023Private and Public Cloud$756,879 $682,146 $618,850 Product Delivery and Services251,730 238,723 245,687 On-Premise Support353,128 355,085 350,164 Services and Support1,361,737 1,275,954 1,214,701 Processing1,013,551 939,589 863,001 Total Revenue$2,375,288 $2,215,543 $2,077,702 Contract BalancesThe following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with clients.June 30,2025June 30,2024Receivables, net$317,977 $333,033 Contract Assets - Current36,221 33,610 Contract Assets - Non-current121,675 103,295 Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Current290,485 317,730 Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Non-current72,889 71,202 Contract assets primarily result from client discounts (contract incentives) where revenue is recognized and payment of consideration under the contract is contingent upon the transfer of services to a client over the contractual period. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from clients in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the client. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $252,710, $270,241, and $267,978, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.Amounts recognized that relate to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration.Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance ObligationsAs of June 30, 2025, estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period totaled $7,710,750. The Company expects to recognize approximately 24% over the next 12 months, 19% in 13 - 24 months, and the balance thereafter.46Table of ContentsContract CostsThe Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with clients that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and client conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized contract costs classified as current, are included within prepaid expenses and other and deferred costs in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, dependent on the nature of the capitalized costs. Capitalized contract costs classified as non-current are included within non-current deferred costs and other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balances sheets, dependent on the nature of the capitalized costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated. Capitalized contract costs as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, were as follows: June 30,2025June 30,2024Capitalized costs to obtain contracts with clients1$267,726 $244,980 Capitalized costs to fulfill contracts with clients273,988 258,172 1 Includes current and non-current capitalized costs of $82,441 and $185,285 at June 30, 2025, respectively, and $68,605 and $176,375 at June 30, 2024, respectively.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, amortization of capitalized contract costs totaled $192,439, $175,029, and $154,008, respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented.NOTE 3.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFor cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, amounts receivable or payable, and short-term borrowings, fair values approximate carrying value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The Company's estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:Level 1: inputs to the valuation are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.Level 2: inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.Level 3: valuation is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the Company's own estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset.Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:Estimated Fair Value MeasurementsTotal Fair Level 1Level 2Level 3ValueJune 30, 2025   Financial Assets:Certificates of Deposit$— $4,620 $— $4,620 June 30, 2024   Financial Assets:Certificates of Deposit$— $3,505 $— $3,505 Financial Liabilities:Credit facilities$— $150,000 $— $150,000 NOTE 4.    LEASESThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception. The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the property and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The lease term is 47Table of Contentsused to determine lease classification as an operating or finance lease and is used to calculate straight-line expense for operating leases.Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. As a practical expedient, lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes, which are comprised of real estate leases and equipment leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include prepaid lease payments and exclude lease incentives received. The Company estimates contingent lease incentives when it is probable that the Company is entitled to the incentive at lease commencement. Since the Company’s leases do not typically provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based upon the information available at commencement date for both real estate and equipment leases. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate using the Company’s current unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors such as collateralization and term to align with the terms of the lease. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. Therefore, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; instead, lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The Company leases certain office space, data centers and equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining terms of 3 months to 8 years. Certain leases contain renewal options for varying periods, which are at the Company’s sole discretion. For leases where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option, such option periods have been included in the determination of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities. Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with the leased asset. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability to the extent they are variable in nature. These variable lease costs are recognized as a variable lease expense when incurred. Certain leases include options to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term, which is assessed as a part of the Company’s lease classification determination. The depreciable life of the ROU asset and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain of a transfer of title or purchase option.At June 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company had operating lease assets of $44,761 and $53,981, respectively. At June 30, 2025, total operating lease liabilities of $51,187 were comprised of current operating lease liabilities of $9,397 and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of $41,790. At June 30, 2024, total operating lease liabilities of $59,604 were comprised of current operating lease liabilities of $8,454 and noncurrent operating lease liabilities of $51,150. Operating lease assets are included within other non-current assets and operating lease liabilities are included with accrued expenses (current portion) and other long-term liabilities (noncurrent portion) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease assets were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $41,229 and $34,306 as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. Operating lease costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $11,420, $10,598, and $11,870, respectively. Total operating lease costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, included variable lease costs of approximately $2,744, $4,087, and $3,608, respectively. Operating lease expense is included within cost of services, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense, dependent upon the nature and use of the ROU asset, in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, operating cash flows for payments on operating leases were $10,612, $9,306, and $12,127, respectively, and ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities were $7, $19,222, and $2,368, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease terms for the Company's operating leases were 69 months, 78 months, and 78 months, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rates were 2.71%, 2.70%, and 2.14%, respectively.48Table of ContentsMaturity of Lease Liabilities under ASC 842Future minimum rental payments on operating leases with initial non-cancellable lease terms in excess of one year were due as follows at June 30, 2025:Due datesFuture Minimum Rental Payments2026$11,047 202710,455 202810,106 20297,548 20306,525 Thereafter11,141 Total lease payments$56,822 Less: interest(5,635)Present value of lease liabilities - lessee$51,187 Future lease payments include $5,464 related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. At June 30, 2025, there were $2,070 material legally binding lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. The Company may sublease its facilities from time to time to third parties. Sublease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is included within revenue on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income. On September 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party to sublease a portion of its Elizabethtown, Kentucky facility. The commencement date of the sublease was October 1, 2023, and it had an initial term of 57 months. Sublease income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, was $887 and $550, respectively. On March 21, 2025, the sublessee provided notice to terminate a portion of the sublease agreement and reduce the square footage of their subleased space effective September 30, 2025, resulting in a termination fee of $332. The remaining space not terminated will continue to be subleased under the original terms of the agreement. There have been no indications of impairment related to the underlying ROU asset for the remaining portion of the sublease.Minimum Sublease PaymentsAt June 30, 2025, the future total minimum sublease payments to be received, including termination fees, were as follows:Due Dates (fiscal year)Future Minimum Sublease Receipts2026$864 2027448 2028462 Total sublease receipts - lessor$1,774 49Table of ContentsNOTE 5.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENTThe classification of property and equipment, together with their estimated useful lives is as follows: June 30,  20252024Estimated Useful LifeLand$16,357 $16,357  Land improvements24,679 24,322 5 - 20 yearsBuildings138,898 133,835 20 - 30 yearsLeasehold improvements50,376 51,432 5 - 30 years1Equipment and furniture461,826 418,853 3 - 10 yearsAircraft and equipment24,959 44,140 4 - 10 yearsConstruction in progress3,797 12,298   720,892 701,237  Less accumulated depreciation499,928 486,168  Property and equipment, net$220,964 $215,069  1 Lesser of lease term or estimated useful lifeThe change in property and equipment in accrued liabilities was an increase of $227 and $723 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.

The state net operating loss and tax credit carryover have varying expiration dates, ranging from fiscal 2026 to 2045. Based on state tax rules which restrict utilization of these losses and tax credits, the Company believes it is more likely than not that $182 of these losses and tax credits will expire unutilized. Accordingly, valuation allowances of $182 and $108 have been recorded against the state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.The Company paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $117,581, $106,966, and $145,862 in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 53Table of ContentsOn July 4, 2025, the President of the United States signed into law legislation referred to as “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R. 1), which enacts substantial changes to the federal income tax law. The legislation includes several business-focused provisions, such as the restoration of immediate expensing for domestic research and development expenditures and the reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025. The Act also permanently extends key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). As the legislation was enacted after the June 30, 2025, balance sheet date, the financial implications are not included in the current fiscal year's financial statements. The Company is in the process of assessing the impacts of the new law and plans to incorporate updates in the financial results next fiscal year beginning in the quarter ending September 30, 2025.At June 30, 2025, the Company had $21,723 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $19,526 of which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $19,077 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $17,222 of which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $4,375 and $3,351 related to uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties are recorded as other long-term liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, except for $3,449 recorded as deferred income tax liability at June 30, 2025. The income tax provision included interest expense and penalties (or benefits) on unrecognized tax benefits of $796, $1,132, and $529 in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, follows: Unrecognized Tax BenefitsBalance at July 1, 2022$8,990 Additions for current year tax positions2,570 Additions for prior year tax positions2,433 Reductions for prior year tax positions(350)Reductions related to expirations of statute of limitations(1,638)Balance at June 30, 202312,005 Additions for current year tax positions3,924 Additions for prior year tax positions4,672 Reductions related to expirations of statute of limitations(1,524)Balance at June 30, 202419,077 Additions for current year tax positions4,480 Additions for prior year tax positions834 Reductions for prior year tax positions(27)Reductions related to expirations of statute of limitations(2,641)Balance at June 30, 2025$21,723 The U.S. federal and state income tax returns for fiscal 2022 and all subsequent years remain subject to examination as of June 30, 2025, under statute of limitations rules. In addition, certain U.S. state income tax returns remain subject to examination as of June 30, 2025, under the statute of limitation rules for fiscal 2016 through 2022. The Company anticipates that potential changes due to lapsing statutes of limitations and examination closures could reduce the unrecognized tax benefits balance by $3,000 — $9,000 within twelve months of June 30, 2025.NOTE 9.    INDUSTRY AND SUPPLIER CONCENTRATIONThe Company sells its products to banks, credit unions, and financial institutions throughout the United States and generally does not require collateral. Billings to clients are typically due 30 days from date of billing. Reserves are maintained for potential credit losses. Client-related risks are moderated through the inclusion of credit mitigation clauses in the Company's contracts and through the monitoring of timely payments. In addition, some of the Company’s key solutions are dependent on technology manufactured by third parties. Termination of the Company’s relationship with one or more of these third parties could have a negative impact on the operations of the Company. 54Table of ContentsNOTE 10.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe Company's pre-tax operating income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, includes $28,392, $28,873, and $28,611, respectively, of equity-based compensation costs, of which $25,757, $26,361, and $26,427, respectively, relates to the restricted stock plans. Costs are recorded net of estimated forfeitures. The total income tax benefits from equity-based compensation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $4,479, $4,495, and $5,115, respectively. These income tax benefits from stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings included income tax net excess benefits of $283 and $1,109 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2023, respectively, and income tax net shortfalls of $184 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. On November 10, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("2015 EIP") for its associates and non-employee directors. The plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares or units, and performance shares or units. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is 3,000.Stock option awardsUnder the 2015 EIP, terms and vesting periods of the stock options are determined by the Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when granted. The options granted under this plan are exercisable beginning three years after grant at an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date. The options terminate upon surrender of the option, ninety days after termination of employment, upon the expiration of one year following notification of a deceased optionee, or 10 years after grant. During fiscal 2025, there were no options granted or forfeited, and 12 options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $87.27 per share with a total exercise intrinsic value of $991. At June 30, 2025, there were no options outstanding. During fiscal 2024, there were no options granted, forfeited, or exercised, and at June 30, 2024, 12 options were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $87.27. During fiscal 2023, there were no options granted, forfeited, or exercised, and at June 30, 2023, 12 options were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $87.27. All remaining options were granted on July 1, 2016. At June 30, 2025, there was no compensation cost yet to be recognized related to options. Restricted stock unit and performance unit awardsWith respect to awards of restricted stock units and performance units, it is the intention of the Company to settle the unit awards in shares of the Company’s stock. Restricted stock unit awards (which are unit awards that have service requirements only and are not tied to performance measures) generally vest over a period of 1 to 3 years. Performance unit awards are awards that have performance measures in addition to service requirements.The following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards as of June 30, 2025, as well as activity for the fiscal year then ended:Unit awardsSharesWeighted Average Grant Date Fair ValueAggregate Intrinsic ValueOutstanding July 1, 2022303 $166.50 Granted1136 214.78 Vested(120)159.10 Forfeited2(16)186.35 Outstanding July 1, 2023303 190.08 Granted1160 177.95 Vested(99)170.25 Forfeited2(39)194.11 Outstanding July 1, 2024325 189.68 Granted1162 171.90 Vested(122)183.64 Forfeited2(17)182.81 Outstanding June 30, 2025348 $183.88 $62,610 1 Granted includes restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with market conditions at 100% achievement.2 Forfeited includes restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards forfeited for service requirements not met and performance unit awards not settled due to underachievement of performance measures.55Table of ContentsOf the 162 unit awards granted in fiscal 2025, 115 were restricted stock unit awards and 47 were performance unit awards. The restricted stock unit awards were valued at the weighted average fair value of the non-vested units based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards. 18 of the performance unit awards granted in fiscal 2025 were valued at grant by estimating 100% payout at release and using the fair market value of the Company equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period. The payout at release of approximately half of these performance unit awards will be determined based on the Company's compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") for revenue (excluding adjustments) for the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. The performance payout at release of the other half of these performance unit awards will be determined based on the expansion of the Company's non-GAAP operating margin over the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. 26 of the performance unit awards have market conditions and were valued at grant using a Monte Carlo pricing model as of the measurement date customized to the specific provisions of the Company’s plan design. The remaining 3 performance unit awards had other performance targets. Per the Company's award vesting and settlement provisions, the performance unit awards that utilized a Monte Carlo pricing model were valued at grant on the basis of Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to the compensation peer group made up of participants approved by the Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors for fiscal years 2025 and 2024. For fiscal year 2023, TSR was in comparison to the compensation peer group comprised of the Standard & Poor's 1500 Software & Services Index ("S&P 1500 S&S Index") participant companies and other participants approved by the Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. TSR is defined as the change in the stock price through the performance period plus dividends per share paid during the performance period, all divided by the stock price at the beginning of the performance period.The Monte Carlo inputs used in the model to estimate fair value at the measurement date and resulting values for these performance unit awards are as follows:Year Ended June 30,Monte Carlo award inputs:202520242023Compensation Peer Group:1Volatility24.5 %25.6 %29.4 %Risk free interest rate3.72 %4.48 %2.96 %Annual dividend based on most recent quarterly dividend$2.20 $2.08 $1.96 Dividend yield1.3 %1.2 %0.9 %Beginning average percentile rank for TSR41 %74 %71 %1 For fiscal 2023, S&P 1500 S&S Index participants were included in the compensation peer group.At June 30, 2025, there was $18,018 of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock unit and performance unit awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 0.99 years.The fair values of restricted stock units and performance units at release totaled $22,591, $16,544, and $24,931 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 56Table of ContentsNOTE 11.    EARNINGS PER SHAREThe following table reflects the reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share.Year Ended June 30, 202520242023Net Income$455,748 $381,816 $366,646 Common share information:Weighted average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share72,874 72,867 72,918 Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance units171 158 178 Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share73,045 73,025 73,096 Basic earnings per share$6.25 $5.24 $5.03 Diluted earnings per share$6.24 $5.23 $5.02 Per share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each of the fiscal years. Stock options, restricted stock units, and performance units have been included in the calculation of earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. The two-class method for computing EPS has not been applied because no outstanding awards contain non-forfeitable rights to participate in dividends. There were 18 anti-dilutive weighted average shares excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025, 33 shares were excluded for fiscal 2024, and 10 shares were excluded for fiscal 2023. NOTE 12.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSThe Company established an employee stock purchase plan (the "Plan") in 2006. On January 1, 2024, the Plan was amended and restated, and allows substantially all associates the opportunity to directly purchase shares of the Company at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value, as defined by the Plan, of the Company's stock on the first trading day or on the last trading day of a three-month offering period, which represents an option. Prior to January 1, 2024, the Plan allowed substantially all associates the opportunity to directly purchase shares of the Company at 85% of the closing price of the Company's stock on or around the fifteenth day of each month. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, associates purchased 80, 90, and 84 shares under the Plan at average prices of $147.49, $137.78, and $146.79, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 816 shares remained available for future issuance under the Plan. The Plan is considered compensatory, and beginning January 1, 2024, compensation expense is determined based on the option's grant date fair value as estimated by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the offering period. Prior to January 1, 2024, the Company recorded the total dollar value of the stock discount given to associates under the Plan as expense. The Company has a defined contribution plan for its associates: the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1975 (“ERISA”) as amended. Under the Plan, the Company matches 100% of full-time associate contributions up to 5% of eligible compensation. Beginning July 1, 2024, in order to receive matching contributions, associates must be at least 18 years of age and be employed for at least thirty days. Prior to July 1, 2024, associates must have been 18 years of age and been employed for at least six months. The Company has the option of making a discretionary contribution; however, none has been made for any of the three most recent fiscal years. The total matching contributions for the Plan were $34,751, $31,995, and $29,308 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.57Table of ContentsNOTE 13.    BUSINESS ACQUISITIONPayrailzOn August 31, 2022, the Company acquired all of the equity interest in Payrailz. The final purchase price, following customary post-closing adjustments to the extent actual closing date working capital, cash, debt, and unpaid seller transaction expenses exceeded or were less than the amounts estimated at closing, was $230,205. Pursuant to the merger agreement for the transaction, $48,500 of the purchase price was placed in an escrow account at the closing, consisting of $2,500 for any final purchase price adjustments owed by the sellers, which amount was released to the sellers on December 15, 2022, in connection with post-closing purchase price adjustments, and $46,000 for indemnification matters under the merger agreement, which amount was released to the sellers on September 20, 2023.The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's digital financial management solutions and the purchase was originally funded by our revolving line of credit (Note 7) and cash generated from operations. Payrailz provides cloud-native, API-first, AI-enabled consumer and commercial digital payment solutions and experiences that enable money to be moved in the moment of need.Management has completed a purchase price allocation and assessment of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of August 31, 2022, and taking into account the post-closing purchase price adjustment described above, are set forth below:Current assets$1,851 Identifiable intangible assets119,868 Deferred revenue(8,104)Total other liabilities assumed(749)Total identifiable net assets112,866 Goodwill117,339 Net assets acquired$230,205 The goodwill of $117,339 arising from this acquisition consists largely of the growth potential, synergies, and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with those of Payrailz, together with the value of Payrailz's assembled workforce. The goodwill from this acquisition has been allocated to our Payments segment and $117,339 is deductible for income tax purposes.Identifiable intangible assets from this acquisition consist of customer relationships of $6,109, computer software of $112,505, and other intangible assets of $1,254. The amortization period for acquired customer relationships, computer software, and other intangible assets is over a term of 15 years, 10 years, and 15 years, respectively.Current assets were inclusive of cash acquired of $577. The fair value of current assets acquired included accounts receivable of $978, none of which were expected to be uncollectible.NOTE 14.    REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Company is a well-rounded financial technology company and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions.
The Company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other.
The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized accountholder information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, Automated Clearing House ("ACH") origination and remote deposit capture processing, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms and services, including digital/mobile banking, treasury services, online account opening, fraud/anti-money laundering ("AML") and lending/deposit solutions that can be integrated with the Company's Core solutions, and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating expenses not directly attributable to the other three segments.The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"),
regularly evaluated segment performance and made strategic decisions on the allocation of resources to them 58Table of Contentsbased on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023. The CODM used reportable segment revenue, costs of revenue, and segment income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The Company has not disclosed any additional asset information by segment, as the information is not generated for internal management reporting to the CODM.Immaterial adjustments between segments were made in fiscal 2025 to reclassify cost of revenue that was recognized in fiscal years 2024 and 2023. These reclasses were made to be consistent with the current allocation of cost of revenue by segment. Cost of revenue reclassed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, from Complementary to Corporate and Other, was $4,922. Cost of revenue reclassed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, from Core and Complementary to Corporate and Other, was $64 and $5,206, respectively.Year EndedJune 30, 2025CorePaymentsComplementaryCorporate and OtherTotalREVENUEServices and Support$697,084 $93,480 $495,326 $75,847 $1,361,737 Processing42,193 780,018 179,883 11,457 1,013,551 Total Revenue739,277 873,498 675,209 87,304 2,375,288  Cost of Revenue297,372 460,151 264,823 338,401 1,360,747 Research and Development162,771 Selling, General, and Administrative283,055 Total Expenses1,806,573 SEGMENT INCOME$441,905 $413,347 $410,386 $(251,097)OPERATING INCOME568,715 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)17,321 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES$586,036 59Table of ContentsYear EndedJune 30, 2024CorePaymentsComplementaryCorporate and OtherTotalREVENUEServices and Support$649,169 $84,655 $461,828 $80,302 $1,275,954 Processing41,569 733,053 156,383 8,584 939,589 Total Revenue690,738 817,708 618,211 88,886 2,215,543 Cost of Revenue287,349 442,084 251,085 318,959 1,299,477 Research and Development148,256 Selling, General, and Administrative278,419 Total Expenses1,726,152 SEGMENT INCOME$403,389 $375,624 $367,126 $(230,073)OPERATING INCOME489,391 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)8,628 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES$498,019 Year EndedJune 30, 2023CorePaymentsComplementaryCorporate and OtherTotalREVENUEServices and Support$608,517 $79,788 $453,541 $72,855 $1,214,701 Processing40,528 687,521 130,045 4,907 863,001 Total Revenue649,045 767,309 583,586 77,762 2,077,702 Cost of Revenue276,754 420,880 232,552 288,876 1,219,062 Research and Development142,678 Selling, General, and Administrative235,274 Total Expenses1,597,014 SEGMENT INCOME$372,291 $346,429 $351,034 $(211,114)OPERATING INCOME480,688 INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)(6,114)INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES$474,574 60Table of ContentsNOTE 15.
