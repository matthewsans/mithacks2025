Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Unless the context indicates otherwise,
as used in this Annual Report, the terms “SPEV,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company”
and “our business” refer, to Shorepower Technologies Inc. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including
estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon
which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified
by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”
“intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will
be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based
on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.
Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in
economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements.

PART I
Item 1. Business.
We are a transportation electrification
company that builds, deploys and operates plug-in stations that allow electric vehicles, trucks and refrigerated trailers to conveniently
access electric power while parked or staged, resulting in cost savings for fleets and drivers that will not have to use petroleum fuel
thus significantly reducing associated toxic emissions and greenhouse gases by replacing diesel fuel with electric power.
We currently operate the largest
heavy-duty focused network of electrified parking spaces (EPS) in North America. This network includes 60 facilities conveniently located
at travel centers with approximately 1,800 electrified parking spaces. Most of these facilities are focused on truck stop electrification
(TSE) and electric standby transport refrigeration units (eTRU), but several sites already include electric vehicle charging stations.
Shorepower originally started
business as a TSE provider. TSE provides power for hotel loads at commercial parking facilities. Trucks are required to take a rest period
for a minimum of 10 hours per day. Trucks typically run their engines to provide heating and cooling in the cab and power accessories.
Shorepower TSE allows drivers to shut down their main engine and plug into outlets that provide power for household type devices such
as heaters, air-conditioning units, coffee pots, microwaves, TVs, computers and other accessories. On average, this saves drivers and
fleets one gallon of diesel per hour. Idling (running) the engine 10 hours per day, 300 days per year could cost in excess of $10,000
per year in wasted diesel fuel. By using Shorepower, drivers can save over $7,000 annually.
Additionally, we have over 300
electric vehicle charging station connection points (plugs), sold or controlled that could be upgraded to include our latest cellular-based
control module, to make these stations revenue producing stations. Combined with upgrading the TSE stations, we have the potential to
expand to over 2,000 connection points. However, for our first phase of upgrades, we expect to convert up to six stations per facility
to level 2 and add two or more DC fast chargers to select locations.
We believe that the key value
of the existing travel center facilities is the electric infrastructure and utility service that could easily be upgraded to include electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) for heavy-duty trucks and buses. Most of these sites could also accommodate light-duty(automobile) electric
vehicle charging.
Several sites have already been
upgraded (or are in the process of being upgraded) to include level 2 charging connectors. We have secured approximately $400,000 in grants
to upgrade additional sites with total project values of over $1,000,000 (including cost share and host-site contributions) and have an
additional $1,000,000 in grant applications pending. Grants awarded as of March 2025 include approximately $71,000 for TSE equipment in
New Hampshire, $114,000 to upgrade two sites in California to include Level 2 and DC fast charging, $100,000 in Washington State to add
Level 2 charging stations at two facilities, $12,500 to install a charging station in Coos Bay, Oregon, and an additional $100,000+ for
two other projects in California . Two of the California and the New Hampshire projects are already completed, and the Washington contract
is in process. Invoicing for these projects will be processed next quarter.

Competition
We face competition from other
EV charging companies, including ChargePoint, ABB, Cyber Switching, Siemens, Tesla, EVBox, BP, Shell, Hyundai, Electrify America, EVGo,
BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis and others. To be competitive in the EV charging market, we intend
to provide the lowest build-out and operating cost, competitive end-user cost, highest cost savings and best overall feature set from
our proprietary back-office control and payment systems so that our customers achieve a faster ROI than offered by our competitors. In
addition, we believe that our success in obtaining government grants for electric transportation infrastructure will be a competitive
advantage that we have in obtaining additional non-dilutive grants to facilitate our goal of increasing the number of charging stations
in the United States and Canada, as well as our long-term relationships with essential manufacturers of commercial charging equipment.
Additionally, we will explore opportunities to expand into other South American, European and Asian countries as opportunities arise and
resources become available to invest in these regions.

There are two types of TSE systems:
on-board and off-board TSE. In off-board electrification, off-board equipment at the truck stop provides heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC). These HVAC systems are contained in a structure above ground (called a gantry) or on a pedestal beside the truck
parking spaces. A hose from the HVAC system is connected to the truck window and, in some cases, to a computer touch screen that enables
payment. These stand-alone systems are generally owned and maintained by private companies that charge an hourly fee. To accommodate the
HVAC hose, an inexpensive window template may be required in the truck. “Off-board” refers to the location of the HVAC equipment,
since it is off-board (not permanently installed on the truck). IdleAir operates an off-board TSE business.
On-board electrification, also
known as “shorepower,” requires some equipment on-board the truck. Then, trucks can plug into electrical outlets at the truck
stop. To use on-board electrification, trucks must be equipped with electric air conditioning equipment or a portable heater and an extension
cord to plug into the electrical outlet. The trucking company or driver owns and maintains the on-board equipment. Shorepower operates
on-board TSE facilities. Other than the equipment on-board the truck, these systems are generally considered more cost effective to build,
use (hourly fee), maintain and operate. In its simplest form, on-board TSE can be used by simply purchasing a portable heater and an extension
cord for as little as a $40 initial investment. This investment could be recouped during the first day/night of use.
The two types of TSE systems do
not generally serve the same customers, but we may compete for the same space at a truck stop. However, at least two facilities have both
IdleAir and Shorepower in the same parking lot. Additionally, IdleAir currently only has fewer than a dozen operational facilities. Trucks
equipped with electric appliances will generally seek Shorepower (on-board) facilities.
Financing Strategy
Under the current administration,
the future of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, that became law on November 15, 2021, is uncertain. Congress previously authorized $7.5
billion in funding specifically for charging stations. Although the new administration could end this program, there are still plenty
of state level grants, tax credits and utility programs. Shorepower has been highly successful in obtaining government contracts and incentives
to deploy electric transportation infrastructure projects. Funds from the Merger have been expended, primarily on expenses related to
being public (legal, accounting and disclosures). Future funding will come from revenues generated from the business or additional investment.
We have already been awarded approximately $400,000 in grant funding that should start to be distributed in 2025. We are also continuing
to upgrade the control system at existing sites to generate interim income until charging station upgrades generate increased revenue
and we are awarded additional government contracts and/or grants. We estimate that 20% to 50% of infrastructure build-out costs will have
to be contributed by investors and revenues generated from the business, depending on the desired speed of the build out, grant cost share
requirements and electric vehicle demand (based on number of electric vehicles produced). For example, if we are successful in securing
$10 million in grants, we may need to contribute $2 million or more in cost share. We believe that our 20 years of experience in the transportation
electrification space provide a competitive advantage in what we anticipate to be an explosive growth period in the electric vehicle industry.

Key Products and Markets
We offer a line of transportation
electrification stations that allow all types of vehicles to reduce petroleum consumptions whether for reducing engine idling or charging
electric vehicles. Our commercial products are all made with stainless steel enclosures designed to offer decades of service. We already
have some stations that have been operational for over 15 years and several hundred have been in service for more than 10 years. Depending
on the environment and climate the internal electronics are designed to last at least 5-10 years but can last much longer. All components
are serviceable, so it is not necessary to replace the entire station even if one component is damaged.
Our Shorepower Truck Stop Electrification
(TSE) pedestals provide power and entertainment services to long haul truck drivers during rest periods at truck stops, fuel depots, rest
areas, staging areas, warehouses and anywhere trucks and RVs park for extended periods. The unit’s robust design provides years
of operation in harsh environments with relatively low maintenance. These energy vending machines track, control and allow payment for
energy when tied into our back-office system. The Shorepower TSE station is an outdoor-rated unit constructed with high-grade stainless
steel. It is typically mounted to a concrete pad with the supplied base plate. Each Shorepower TSE stations can service up to four vehicles
depending on configuration.
Shorepower’s electric-standby
Transport Refrigeration Unit (eTRU) station provides easy access to higher power refrigerated trailers with electric-standby. This allows
them to run on electricity rather than diesel while stopped, staging or loading/unloading. This provides a clean efficient energy source
for refrigerated loads such as ice cream, meats, vegetables, pharmaceuticals and other frozen goods. This unit typically mounts below
the standard TSE station but is also available as a stand-alone or wall mounted station.
5
Additionally, we offer on-board
equipment to ensure our customers can utilize the TSE facilities we have in place. Accessories we offer include portable heaters, heavy-duty
extension cords and cab wiring kits. Shorepower supplies standard 110v AC and 208v power. Customers can use any off-the-shelf electric
appliance to make life on the road comfortable and convenient: heaters, coffeemakers, microwave ovens, hand-held vacuums, chargers, computers,
cell phone chargers, power tools, etc.
Locations
We have 60 TSE facilities throughout
the country along major Interstates. These sites provide a cost effective solution to reducing truck engine idling. Primary corridors
include Interstate 5 (I-5) on the West Coast, I-95 on the East Coast, I-80/I-90 in the North, I-10/I-20 in the South and other major interconnecting
Interstates and US highways in between. These same facilities will be the first candidates for upgrading to electric vehicle charging
stations. We have an established network of facilities that can easily and cost-effectively be upgraded in the short-term.
Growth Strategies
Our growth strategies to continue
to play a leadership role in EV charging are as follows:
Accelerate new product
offerings.
We intend to have a leadership
position with continued efficient investment in product development. We currently manufacture and sell TSE, eTRU and Level 2 charging
stations. We have recently launched a medium speed cost-effective DC fast charger. We recently submitted a federal proposal to help offset
the cost of developing a new DC fast charger with battery energy storage. This system will store energy from renewable energy sources
such as solar and wind. These renewable energy sources are often available when demand is low. This surplus energy can be used to charge
the battery energy storage when rates are low and can later be offloaded into an electric vehicle, thus maximizing available energy sources
at the highest margin. More information on these efforts is provided in the “research and development” section below.

Invest incrementally in
marketing and sales.
We intend to continue to attract
new customers and pursue a business model which attracts new customers to our charging stations and encourages existing customers to increase
their charging footprint over time as EV penetration increases.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.
We intend to explore potential
high-quality merger and acquisition opportunities in this dynamic marketplace both domestically and overseas. Acquisition candidates include
charging station companies, charging station management software, electrical contractors, alternative fuel equipment suppliers and truck
stop electrification (TSE) providers. An electrical contracting business, for example, would allow us to both sell charging stations and
install them without having to use subcontractors.
Manufacturing
We have established strong commercial
relationships over the decades in which we have been doing business in the transportation electrification industry. We have designed many
of the products that we use, including our comprehensive payment, monitoring and control system with web base management. The majority
of our hardware products are manufactured in Oregon and Michigan. Components are sourced from a number of global suppliers, with concentrations
in the United States and Asia. We work proactively with piece part and final assembly supply partners. We prepare factories for new products,
establish and monitor quality control points, plan ongoing production and issues purchase orders. Most of our major components are manufactured
in the U.S. which will give us strategic advantage for qualifying for grants in the United States.
Government Regulation and Incentives
State, regional and local regulations
for installation of EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements,
licensing of contractors and certifications as examples. Compliance with such regulation(s) may cause installation delays.
OSHA
We are subject to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”). OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance
of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA and various
record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation
and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. We are in full compliance with OSHA regulations.
NEMA
The National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for
the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative
and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data. Our products comply with the NEMA standards that
are applicable to such products.
NRTL Certification
Our stations are certified by
a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). A Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) is a private-sector organization
that OSHA has recognized as meeting the legal requirements in 29 CFR 1910.7 to perform testing and certification of products using consensus-based
test standards We use Intertek Testing Laboratories and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) to certify that our products are safe and use consistent
manufacturing processes. Most permitting jurisdictions require NRTL certification on products installed in their territory.
7
CAFE Standards
The regulations mandated by the
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s
fleet must achieve. Although we are not a car manufacturer and are thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, we believe such standards
may have a material effect on its business. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised the fuel economy standards of America’s
cars, light trucks and sport utility vehicles to a combined average of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020—a 10 miles per gallon
increase over 2007 levels—and required standards to be met at maximum feasible levels through 2030. Building on the success of the
first phase of the National Program, the second phase of fuel economy and global warming pollution standards for light duty vehicles covers
model years 2017–2025. These standards were finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and NHTSA
in August 2012. These standards would have required a reduction in average carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks
to 163 grams per mile (g/mi) in model year 2025. Manufacturers may choose to comply with these standards by manufacturing more EVs which
would mean that more charging stations will be needed.
However, in April 2020, EPA and
NHTSA finalized the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule, which reformulated the required reductions, establishing average carbon
dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks of 240 g/mi in model year 2026. Several states and groups have announced intentions
to sue the U.S. government over this reformulation, so the final CAFE standards cannot currently be predicted with any certainty. However,
to the extent fuel-efficiency standards are decreasing, this may result in less demand for EVs and, in turn, charging stations of the
type we manufacture. Additionally, the new administration may roll back these regulations.
Waste Handling and Disposal
We are subject to laws and regulations
regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws generally
regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict, joint and
several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance,
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, in the United States and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the
legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.
These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed
or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several
strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural
resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third-parties to act in
response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they
incur. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of ordinary operations
and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these
hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate solid wastes,
which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”)
and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation,
storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of our products are excluded from RCRA’s
hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all of the established requirements
for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, we may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which
are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or our ability to qualify
the materials it uses for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our operating expenses.
Research and Development
We have invested a significant
amount of time and expense into research and development of our charging technologies. Our ability to play a leadership position depends
in part on our ongoing research and development activities. Our research and development team is composed of several consultants who are
responsible for the design, development, manufacturing and testing of our products. We focus our efforts on developing charging hardware
and developing the technology to support our software subscriptions and support services.
Our hardware research and development
is principally conducted in Oregon and Michigan. We currently manufacture our own TSE and Level 2 charging stations. We recently launched
our own certified medium speed DC fast chargers. Our engineers are working on software, a smartphone app and a higher-speed DC fast charger
that will include internal battery energy storage. This product will have advantages over standard DC fast chargers in that it will require
much lower input power requirements and can charge vehicles even if there is a power outage, since it has its own battery energy source.
Standard DC fast chargers usually require power upgrades and new utility services which are expensive and time consuming. Our self-contained
DC fast charger could be transported to the host-site and immediately be used to charge vehicles. It could even be used at temporary venues
such as concerts and sporting events with the optional solar array. The internal battery storage can be charged at off-peak hours, then
later be used to charge vehicles during high demand periods. The internal battery storage can also be charged with excess wind energy
(or other renewables) which can help stabilized the grid and make more efficient use of unused solar and wind energy. We have submitted
two grant applications valued at over $2,000,000 to help develop this product.

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent,
trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to
establish, maintain and protect its proprietary rights. Our success depends in part upon its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary
protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others
from infringing our proprietary rights. As of January 15, 2023, we filed for one U.S. patent that was abandoned. Should we file for any
future patents that are issued to us, they may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection
and may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We enter into agreements with
our employees, contractors, customers, partners and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our technology
and other proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized
access, use, copying or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third-parties who may
use our technology or other proprietary information to develop products and services that compete with us. Moreover, others may independently
develop technologies that are competitive with us or that infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property and
proprietary rights, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement
of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful,
but these actions are costly, time-consuming and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated.
We intend to continue to regularly
assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide
a meaningful competitive advantage. However, our ability to do so may be limited until such time as it is able to generate cash flow from
operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in our intellectual property. For example, maintaining patents
in the United States and other countries requires the payment of maintenance fees which, if we are unable to pay, may result in loss of
our patent rights as previously occurred. If we are unable to do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others
from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.
Facilities
Shorepower’s headquarters
are located in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the Portland metro area, where we currently utilize shared office and shop space with a monthly lease
term. We believe this space is sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future and that any additional space we may require in
Oregon will be available on commercially reasonable terms. We also occupy a warehouse in Ferndale, Michigan near Detroit on a month-to-month
basis. This building has space to expand as needed for offices, manufacturing and assembly. We plan on updating this facility to add office
space and a light assembly area as required.
Employees
We currently have two employees,
Jeff Kim, and a technician. We currently use consultants to perform, bookkeeping, accounting, engineering and installation services. The
use of consultants and contractors has enabled us to keep overhead costs low by utilizing resources as needed. However, we expect to employ
additional personnel following receipt of sufficient funding to do so as discussed above. We will strive to offer competitive employee
compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain a skilled and diverse workforce. Since the Merger, we hired the following consultants:
a business development specialist with grant writing expertise, an engineer for R&D of new products and updates to current products
and a CPA to aid in preparing financial statements.
Legal Proceedings
We are not party to any material
legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of
business. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs,
diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
We use,
store and process data for and about our customers, employees, partners and suppliers. We have implemented a cybersecurity risk management
program that is designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats to this data, our systems and business operations.
Cyber Risk Management
and Strategy
Under
the oversight of the Board of Directors since we do not currently have an Audit Committee, we have implemented and maintain a risk management
program that includes processes for the systematic identification, assessment, management, and treatment of cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity
oversight and operational processes are integrated into our overall risk management processes, and cybersecurity is one of our designated
risk categories. We implement a risk-based approach to the management of cyber threats, supported by cybersecurity technologies, including
automated tools, designed to monitor, identify, and address cybersecurity risks. In support of this approach, our IT security team implements
processes to assess, identify, and manage security risks to the company, including in the pillar areas of security and compliance, application
security, infrastructure security, and data privacy. This process includes regular compliance and critical system access reviews. In addition,
we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments
as part of our risk management process. We also maintain an incident response plan to guide our processes in the event of an incident.
We utilize
third parties and consultants to assist in the identification and assessment of risks, including to support tabletop exercises and to
conduct security testing. We utilize well-known cloud-based technologies and service providers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Office, and
Google enterprise to provide protection against cybersecurity threats. We have a special email encryption from Google that protect against
cyberthreats.
Further,
we have processes in place to evaluate potential risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers
that will have access to our data, including a review process for such providers’ cybersecurity practices, risk assessments, contractual
requirement, and system monitoring.
We continue
to evaluate and enhance our systems, controls, and processes where possible, including in response to actual or perceived threats specific
to us or experienced by other companies.
Risks
from cybersecurity threats have to date not materially affected us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.
For more information, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, the section titled “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Company and

PART II.
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is quoted on
the OTC QB Market under the symbol “SPEV”.
Our shares are subject to Section
15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the “penny stock” rule. The rule defines
penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules may
restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to
sell their shares. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make
a special suitability determination for the purchase of the security. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals with assets
in excess of $1,000,000 (not including their personal residence) or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse,
and certain institutional investors. The rules require the broker-dealer to receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction
prior to the purchase and require the broker-dealer to deliver a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock prior to the first
transaction. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and
current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to customers disclosing recent price information for the
penny stocks.
Holders
As of March 31, 2025 there were
approximately 733 registered holders of record of our common stock, in addition to other persons who are beneficial owners of our common
stock held in street name. The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Olde Monmouth Stock Transfer, 200 Memorial Pkwy, Atlantic
Highlands, NJ 07716. Their telephone number is (732) 872-2727.
Dividends
We have not paid cash or stock
dividends and have no present plan to pay any dividends, intending instead to reinvest our earnings, if any. For the foreseeable future,
we expect to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and the payment of any cash dividends on our common
stock is unlikely.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Shorepower Technologies Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficiency, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Shorepower Technologies Inc. as of December 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company’s present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2024
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS
Shorepower Technologies Inc. (“SPEV” “Shorepower”
“the Company”) (formerly United States Basketball League, Inc)
was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 1984, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Meisenheimer Capital, Inc. (“MCI”) for the purpose
of developing and managing a professional basketball league, the United States Basketball League (the “League”).
On April 7, 2021, through a series of Stock Purchase
Agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”), the majority owners of the Company, Richard C. Meisenheimer, Daniel T. Meisenheimer,
III, James Meisenheimer, Meisenheimer Capital, Inc. and Spectrum Associates, Inc. (the “Sellers”) sold 2,704,007 common shares
which it held, to a new investor group. The Sellers also sold 1,105,644 of SPEV’s preferred stock at a per share price of $.057
per share to EROP Enterprises, LLC. As a result of the sale of common and preferred stock by the Sellers, the Company experienced a change
in control.
World Equity Markets acted in the capacity of a broker/dealer
for the Purchase Agreements and was issued 125,000 shares of common stock for its services, and Verde Capital was issued 150,000 shares
for Consulting Services. Effective April 7, 2021, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Daniel T. Meisenheimer, III as Chairman
of the Board of Directors and President of the Company. Effective April 7, 2021, Saeb Jannoun was appointed to fill the vacancy following
the resignation of Daniel T. Meisenheimer, III as Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of the Company. Mr. Michael Pruitt
also joined the Board.
The Company’s Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) with Shurepower, LLC d/b/a Shorepower Technologies under which Shorepower was merged with and into SPEV
(the “Merger”) was closed on March 22, 2023.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Jeff Kim,
the prior CEO of Shurepower, LLC and the current CEO of the Company, now owns 26,089,758 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock. 11,000,000 shares of common stock were sold under the Pre-Merger Financing that raised $660,000. Mr. Kim has received 2,000,000
shares of a Series B Preferred stock and the right to receive the following additional shares of SPEV common stock upon achieving the
following milestones: (i) an additional 2.5% of the issued and outstanding SPEV Common Stock upon the completion of either (a) the conversion
of 75 existing connection points to Level 2 or greater or the (b) installation of 75 new connection points to revenue producing stations
in the first 12 months or some combination of the two yielding 75 units, (ii) an additional 2.5% of the of the issued and outstanding
SPEV Common Stock upon (a) the application for $10M in grants and/or the (b) the award of $1.0 million in grants in the first 18 months;
(iii) an additional 2.5% of the issued and outstanding SPEV common stock outstanding upon the completion of acquisitions in the first
24 months generating no less than $3.0 million in gross revenues and (iv) an additional 500,000 shares of SPEV common stock upon acquiring
or hiring the following key personnel in the first six months after the effective date of the merger: (a) three or more qualified Board
members and (b) at least three of the following four individuals having the following qualifications: one sales/marketing person, one
grant writer/Government relations person, one technician/maintenance person and one software programmer/engineer.
We accounted
for the Merger transaction as a recapitalization resulting from the acquisition by a non-operating public company that is not a shell
company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). This accounting treatment as a recapitalization is consistent
with Commission guidance promulgated in staff speeches and the SEC Reporting Manual, Topic 12 on Reverse Acquisitions and Recapitalizations.
As such, the transaction is outside the scope of FASB ASC 805. Specifically, the Merger transaction was treated as a reverse recapitalization
in which the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is determined to be the accounting acquiree, while the entity receiving
securities (the legal acquiree) is the accounting acquirer.
Under reverse
merger accounting (i.e., recapitalization), historical financial statements of Shurepower, LLC (the
legal acquiree, accounting acquirer), are presented with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s
legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal
parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in the financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect
the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).
F-7
Effective on
the date of closing the merger, Saeb Jannoun and Michael D. Pruitt resigned as directors of the Company, and Mr. Jannoun resigned as the
CEO. Jeff Kim was appointed as the sole officer and director.
Effective June 20, 2023, the Company’s name
was changed to Shorepower Technologies Inc and its ticker symbol to SPEV.
The Company is a transportation electrification infrastructure
manufacturer and service provider of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), Truck Stop Electrification (TSE) and electric standby Transport
Refrigeration Unit (eTRU) stations. They have 60 operational TSE facilities with over 1,800 individual electrified parking spaces in 31
states. Shorepower’s stations are EPA SmartWay-Verified and CARB-Verified. The Company has headquarters in Hillsboro (Portland Area),
Oregon and an office in Detroit, Michigan metro area. Shorepower is a certified minority owned business enterprise (MBE). The Company’s
management team is comprised of a group of seasoned individuals with knowledge of technology, transportation and heavy-duty vehicles and
nearly two decades working together. Combined, the team has managed over $16 million in government contracts and grant funds to deploy
transportation electrification throughout the nation.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Effective July 10, 2024, the Company
has changed its fiscal year end from February 28 to December 31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s accounting estimates include the collectability
of receivables.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the
Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash is deposited with
major financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurable amount (“FDIC”).
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no cash in excess of the FDIC’s $250,000 coverage limit.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value
measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels
of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in
active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not
corroborated by market data.
F-8
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable represents the fair value of such instruments
as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.
Stock-based Compensation
We account for equity-based transactions with employees
and non-employees under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (“Topic
718”), which establishes that equity-based payments to employees and non-employees are recorded at the grant date the fair
value of the equity instruments the entity is obligated to issue when the employees and non-employees have rendered the requisite service
and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments. Topic 718 also states that observable
market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and, if available,
should be used as the basis for the measurement for equity and liability instruments awarded in these share-based payment transactions.
However, if observable market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments are not available, the fair value shall be
estimated by using a valuation technique or model that complies with the measurement objective, as described in Topic 718.
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant
to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares
of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares
assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s
diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive
effect due to the Company generating a loss.
Accounts Receivable
Revenues that have been recognized
but not yet received are recorded as accounts receivable. Losses on receivables will be recognized when it is more likely than not
that a receivable will not be collected.\There was no
account receivable at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Adoption
of CECL
On
January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“CECL”), using the modified retrospective
method.
The
Company maintains an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) to cover expected lifetime losses on financial assets measured at
amortized cost, including account receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, and loan receivables. The ACL represents management’s
best estimate of probable credit losses, determined using historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts.
Expected
credit losses are measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. For assets without similar risk characteristics,
the Company evaluates expected losses individually. The Company applies a discounted cash flow approach / loss-rate method / probability-of-default
model (customize based on your methodology).
For
the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that no provisions for credit losses were required.
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for
those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify
the contract (or PO) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4)
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies
a performance obligation. The Company generated revenues from selling power vending stations (charging stations) or services. The Company
considers its performance obligations satisfied upon shipment and/or delivery of the purchased products to the customer. The Company evaluates
returns from customers purchasing product on a case-by-case basis and generally will issue replacement product in the limited cases of
product returns. The Company has no policy requiring cash refunds.
Product
sales – Revenue is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and the Company satisfies its
performance obligation, which generally is at the time it ships the product to the customer or installation of the product.
Service
revenue – Revenue is recognized at the point of when a particular charging session is completed.
F-9
The
Company does not have reportable segments, and all sales occurred in the United States.
Customer
Concentration
For
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, certain customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. The following
table presents revenue from those customers as a percentage of total sales:
SCHEDULE OF CUSTOMERS CONCENTRATION
Customer
2024 % of Revenue
2023 % of Revenue
Customer A
-
27.33%
Customer B
44.93%
-
Customer C
21,50%
-
Customer
21,50%
-
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenues includes actual product cost, labor,
if any, and direct overheard, including utility (electricity) bills, which is applied on a per unit basis.
Revenue sharing arrangement
Revenue-sharing arrangements are recognized gross
when the Company has reasonable latitude in establishing the price billed to the end customer and has the primary responsibility to determine
the service specifications. The Company receives gross revenues from its customers, then pays the host-sites their revenue share on a
quarterly basis. The revenue share varies depending on the site.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
and liability method, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required
to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment
Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which will add required disclosures of significant expenses
for each reportable segment, as well as certain other disclosures to help investors understand how the CODM evaluates segment expenses
and operating results. The new standard will also allow disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability if those measures are
used to allocate resources and assess performance. The amendments will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation
of Income Statement Expenses (“DISE”), which will require additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in
the income statement in response to longstanding requests from investors for more information about an entity’s expenses. This ASU
was further clarified by ASU 2025-01, Income Statement (Topic 220): Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures,
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which was issued in December 2024. The new standards require disclosures about specific
types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling
expenses. The new standards will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective
application. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standard updates on its financial
statements.
The Company has implemented all new applicable accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit
of $2,941,047 as of December 31, 2024, with minimal revenue generated. Due to these conditions,
it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
F-10
NOTE 4 – NOTE RECEIVABLE
On November 25, 2023, the Company
entered into a Promissory Note Agreement with Convoy Solutions, LLC (“Convoy”), for up to $40,000.
The note is non-interest bearing but does incur a 1% weekly fee on the amount outstanding; however, this was not enforced.

NOTE 11 – WARRANTS
On February 17, 2023, the Company sold 11,000,000
shares of common stock through the purchase of units at a price of $0.06 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and
one warrant to purchase common stock, for total proceeds of $660,000. The Warrants are exercisable for shares of the Company’s common
stock at a price of $0.25 per share and expire two years from the date of issuance. The warrants are callable by the Company if its common
stock trades at $0.75 for at least 20 trading days and at a volume of not less than 30,000 shares per day. Using the fair value calculation,
the relative fair value for the warrants was calculated to determine the warrants recorded equity amount of $524,737, which has been accounted
for in additional paid in capital.
In accordance to ASC 815-40, an equity-linked financial
instrument can be classified in equity only if it (1) is indexed to the reporting entity’s own stock and (2) meets all other conditions
for equity classification. The warrants are classified as equity instruments because a fixed amount of cash is exchanged for a fixed amount
of equity.
The fair value of the warrants was determined using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions, the expected life of the warrants, and the
expected stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s
best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and
management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards.
The assumptions used to determine the fair value of
the Warrants as follows:
SCHEDULE OF WARRANTS FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS
Expected life (years)
2
Risk-free interest rate
4.78%
Expected volatility
224.92%
Dividend yield
0%
The expected life of the warrants was estimated using
the “simplified method,” as the Company has no historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise
patterns for its warrant grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each
grant. The expected life of awards that vest immediately use the contractual maturity since they are vested when issued.
For stock price volatility, the Company calculated
its expected volatility based on the historical closing price of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The risk-free interest rate
is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the warrant at the grant-date.

NOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method
whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred
tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% is being used.
Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components
as of December 31:

At December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating
loss carry forwards of approximately $618,000 that may be offset against future taxable income. NOLs from tax years up to 2017 can be
carried forward twenty years. Under the CARES Act, the Company carry forward NOLs indefinitely for
NOLs generated in a tax year beginning after 2017, that remain after they are carried back to tax years in the five-year carryback period.
No tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2024, financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a
valuation allowance of the same amount.
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should
a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. With few exceptions, the Company
is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Management’s Report Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
During the fourth quarter of the
year ended December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the required time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error
or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
To address the material weaknesses,
we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial statements included in this annual
report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, we engaged accounting consultants
to assist in the preparation of our financial statements. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this
report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
our principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over our financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
using the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal controls
over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2024.
We are aware of the following
material weaknesses in internal control that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data:
●
Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual transactions
●
Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place
●
Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting.
13
Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls
Internal control over financial
reporting has inherent limitations, which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance,
interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel
factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process, which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses
in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion
or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in
our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2024, that have
materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Name
Age
Position
Jeff Kim (1)
51
CEO, President and Director
(1)
Appointed March 22, 2023.
Background of Executive Officers and Directors
Mr. Kim
has been involved with truck idle-reduction technologies for more than 20 years as an engineering consultant and design specialist. In
a project sponsored by NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research & Development Authority), he performed an operational analysis of competing
off-board truck stop electrification (TSE) facilities which helped develop a comprehensive understanding of the technical issues of TSE
technologies. He then led the design of the simpler and more cost effective Shorepower TSE infrastructure system that includes power and
entertainment connections: electrical power, video, and wireless Internet. He also led the design team responsible for the engineering
and assembly of Shorepower’s comprehensive unattended automated payment and control system. Mr. Kim presented preliminary findings
for the TSE demonstrations at the Transportation Research Board’s 83rd Annual Meeting in Washington, DC in January 2004.
Mr. Kim
has been responsible for all Shorepower corporate operations and will continue to work with local, state and regional stakeholders to
develop a strong market position for electric transportation infrastructure. He will continue to recommend product improvements and establish
R&D objectives, lead product engineering, manage assimilation of data collected from electrified facilities, and oversee site construction
and deployment activities at future locations. Mr. Kim has also been intimately involved with an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
effort to develop electrical codes and standards for electric transportation power infrastructure. In February 2007 (https://www.ecmag.com/magazine/articles/article-detail/codes-standards-big-rigs-getting-good-nights-rest)
the group submitted recommended standards to the National Electric Code (NEC), which is now in the National Electrical Code Handbook,
used by the majority of jurisdictions throughout North America.
14
In 2005
Mr. Kim completed the development and demonstration of a higher power Shorepower variant to provide electrical power to electric standby
transport refrigeration units (eTRU) on trailers, to keep refrigerated loads, such as meats, ice cream and pharmaceuticals, cool while
stopped (or during loading/unloading). This technology leveraged the existing Shorepower system design, but with significantly increased
power ratings that can employ a simplified automated control system. This system was the first of its kind deployed to two warehouses
in New York but is now commonly used as a more efficient and clean alternative to running diesel TRUs.
Mr. Kim
performed an operational analysis of TSE facilities as part of the work sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and has a comprehensive
understanding of the technical attributes of these technologies. This $20 million project commissioned over 50 facilities with over 1,800
individual electrified parking spaces in 31 states. Jeff was also instrumental in the engineering and construction management of these
facilities, which includes design, cost considerations, safety, vehicle access/egress and maintenance of these facilities. This project
was conducted from 2010 through 2015 with the majority of the construction activity completed in 2012 through 2013.
Mr. Kim
was appointed by Oregon’s governor to the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Working Group which helped develop the State’s
electrification plan. in September 2008 (https://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/09/oregon-governor.html). This plan provided guidance to
jurisdictions within the state to help adopt electric vehicle (EV) friendly zoning and planning codes and standards.
Mr. Kim
also consulted for TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) in 2008, to help develop a transportation electrification plan in Japan and how
to capitalize on providing electricity to power the transportation sector.
Mr. Kim
led the engineering team that designed, manufactured and installed some of the first (SAE J1772) Level 2 charging stations in the world
in 2009, to prepare for the arrival of the first current generation of electric vehicles in 2010+. In partnership with PGE, an electric
utility company in Oregon, this program deployed over 300 charging points in and around Oregon to help prepare for the introduction of
the first electric vehicles to hit the market that included the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt.
Mr. Kim
received a Bachelor’s Degree in Renewable Energy Resources from the University of California-Berkeley in 1995 and a Masters in Mechanical
Engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park in 2003.
The Company does not have a separate
audit committee. The Board of Directors functions as the audit committee.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s executive officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered
class of its equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Forms 3, 4 and 5 they file with the
SEC. Based solely upon our review of the copies of the forms the Company has received, we believe that all such persons complied on a
timely basis with all filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during fiscal 2024.
Code of Ethics
Following the merger with Shorepower,
we have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to its principal executive officer, and principal financial officer which is available on
our website. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Code of Conduct and must approve any waivers of the Code of Conduct for employees,
executive officers and directors. Any amendments to the Code of Conduct, or any waivers of its requirements, will be disclosed on our
website.
