USE
OF MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-K includes market and industry data that we have obtained from third-party sources, including industry publications,
as well as industry data prepared by our management on the basis of its knowledge of and experience in the industries in which we operate
(including our management’s estimates and assumptions relating to such industries based on that knowledge). Management has developed
its knowledge of such industries through its experience and participation in these industries. While our management believes the third-party
sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K are reliable, neither we nor our management have independently verified any
of the data from such sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied
upon by such sources. Furthermore, internally prepared and third-party market prospective information, in particular, are estimates only
and there will usually be differences between the prospective and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. Also, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K to any publications,
reports, surveys or articles prepared by third parties should not be construed as depicting the complete findings of the entire publication,
report, survey or article. The information in any such publication, report, survey or article is not incorporated by reference in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-K.
Solely
for convenience, we refer to trademarks in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K without the ® or the ™ or symbols, but such references
are not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our own trademarks. Other
service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K, if any, are the property of their respective
owners, although for presentational convenience we may not use the ® or the ™ symbols to identify such trademarks.
OTHER
PERTINENT INFORMATION
Unless
the context otherwise indicates, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Deep Green” “we,”
“us,” “our,” the “Company” and similar terms refer to Deep Green Waste & Recycling, Inc., a Wyoming
corporation formerly known as Critic Clothing, Inc., and affiliates.
CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2024 (the “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements relate to future events (including, without limitation, the terms, timing
and closing of our proposed acquisitions or our future financial performance). We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements
by using terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,” “continue,”
“could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,”
“predict,” “should” or “will” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These
statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed,
and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report is filed to confirm these statements
to actual results, unless required by law.
You
should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report identify
important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things:
●
Our
ability to effectively execute our business plan;
●
Our
ability to manage our expansion, growth and operating expenses;
●
Our
ability to protect our brands and reputation;
3
●
Our
ability to repay our debts;
●
Our
ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics;
●
Our
ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry;
●
Our
ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior;
●
Risks
in connection with completed or potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic growth opportunities and initiatives;
●
Risks
related to the anticipated timing of the closing of any potential acquisitions;
●
Risks
related to the integration with regards to potential or completed acquisitions;
●
Various
risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-K also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market
size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give
undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties
and contained in this Quarterly Report and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do generally believe
the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of
the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not
limited to, the possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in consumer product development; that existing and potential distribution
partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or pricing terms;
that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that we may be unable maintain profitability; that we may be unable to
attract and retain key personnel; or that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships with customers;
that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those
expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Deep Green Waste &
Recycling, Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deep
Green Waste & Recycling, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ (deficiency), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Deep Green Waste & Recycling, Inc. as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Going Concern Uncertainty
The accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note N to the financial statements, the Company’s present
financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to this
matter are also described in Note N. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

On
August 24, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations
(the “Agreement”) with St. James Capital Management, LLC. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company transferred and assigned
all of the assets of the Company related to its extreme sports apparel design and manufacturing business in exchange for the assumption
of certain liabilities and cancellation of 2,000 shares (as adjusted for the September 27, 2017 reverse stock split of 1 share for 1000
shares and the June 20, 2023 reverse stock split of 1 share for 1,500 shares) of common stock of the Company.
On
August 24, 2017, the Company acquired all the membership units of Deep Green Waste and Recycling, LLC (“DGWR LLC”), a Georgia
limited liability company engaged in the waste recycling business since 2011, in exchange for 56,667 shares (as adjusted for the September
27, 2017 reverse stock split of 1 share for 1000 shares and the June 20, 2023 reverse stock split of 1 share for 1,500 shares) of the
Company’s common stock. The transaction was accounted for as a “reverse merger” where DGWR LLC was considered the accounting
acquiror and the Company was considered the accounting acquiree.
Effective
October 1, 2017, Deep Green acquired Compaction and Recycling Equipment, Inc. (CARE), a Portland, Oregon based company that sells and

NOTE
B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
This
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements.
The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently
applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
Interim
Financial Statements
The
audited condensed financial statements of the Company for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant
to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. However, such
information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for the fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 was derived from
the audited financial statements included in the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
on April 22, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Deep Green Waste & Recycling, Inc. (“Deep Green”) and Deep
Green’s wholly owned subsidiaries, DG Research, Inc., DG Treasury, Inc. and Lyell Environmental Services Inc. All inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash
Equivalents
Investments
having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash are considered to be cash equivalents. For the
periods presented, the Company had no cash equivalents.

B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Income
Taxes
In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset
and liability method. The asset and liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at
the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial
statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance
is provided when it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.
We
expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority
would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount to
be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax
positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we
had no uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative
expenses. We currently have no federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any federal or state examinations since our inception.
To date, we have not incurred any interest or tax penalties.
Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We
adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis. ASC Topic 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that requires the use of fair value
measurements that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level
1:
Observable
inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2:
Observable
market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level
3:
Unobservable
inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.
Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event
occurs. Except for the derivative liability (see NOTE J), where Level 2 inputs were used, we had no financial assets or liabilities
carried and measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the periods presented.
For
nonrecurring fair value measurements of issuances of common stock for services and in satisfaction of convertible notes payable and accrued
interest (see NOTE K), we used Level 2 inputs.
Derivative
Liabilities
We
evaluate convertible notes payable, stock options, stock warrants and other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40, Derivative
Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.

NOTE
B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The
result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and
is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability,
the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of
a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified
to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company’s long-lived assets (consisting primarily of property, equipment and intangible assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to
be generated by that asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge
is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Through September 30, 2024,
the Company has not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Routine maintenance and repairs and minor replacement
costs are charged to expense as incurred, while expenditures that extend the life of these assets are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization
are provided for in amounts sufficient to write off the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives.
The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation for both financial reporting and tax purposes. Upon the sale or retirement
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization will be removed from the accounts and the resulting
profit or loss will be reflected in the statement of operations. The estimated lives used to determine depreciation and amortization
are:

relates to the acquisition of Lyell Environmental Services, Inc. on October 19, 2021.
We
test indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative
factors in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our intangible assets or reporting units are greater
than their carrying value. If the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that the intangible asset/ reporting unit’s fair
value may be less than its carrying value, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment altogether, we are required to perform
a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the intangible asset/reporting unit and comparing the fair value with
its associated carrying value. The estimated fair value of our reporting units is determined based upon the income approach using discounted
future cash flows. In situations where the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the
shortfall.

Amortizable
Intangible Assets
Amortizable
intangible assets consist of the customer lists and covenants not to compete acquired in connection with the Lyell Environmental Services,
Inc. acquisition on October 19, 2021.
We
test amortizable intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. These
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. We established the fair value
of these amortizable intangible assets based on the income approach using discounted future cash flows.
Equity
Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services
Issuances
of our common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair
value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity
instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn
the equity instruments is reached (a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude
that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.
Although
situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time, the equity award granted to the party performing
the service may be fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a result, in this situation in which vesting periods
do not exist if the instruments are fully vested on the date of agreement, we determine such date to be the measurement date and will
record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to expense over the contract
period. When it is appropriate for us to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement
date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current fair values.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for share-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”. Under this guidance, stock compensation
expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the estimated service
period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line attribute method. Share-based awards to non-employees are accounted for in
accordance with ASC 505-50 “Equity”, wherein such awards are expensed over the period in which the related services are rendered.
Related
Parties
A
party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with us. Related parties also include our principal owners, our management, members of the immediate families
of our principal owners and our management and other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing
its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties,
or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one
or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, is also a related party.

Revenue
Recognition

Advertising
Costs
Advertising
costs, which were not significant for the periods presented, are expensed as incurred.
Loss
per Share
We
compute net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements
for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.
Basic
loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net
loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock
options, warrants and convertible securities) outstanding. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per
share are excluded from the calculation.
For
the periods presented, we have excluded the shares issuable from the convertible notes payable (see NOTE I) and the warrants (see
NOTE K) from our diluted net loss per share calculation as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Recently
Enacted Accounting Standards
In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, which has superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09
is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle
and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than was required under prior U.S.
GAAP. We adopted ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 has not had any significant effect on our financial statements for
the periods presented.
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to provide guidance on recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements, specifically differentiating between different types
of leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases. The
recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed
from previous GAAP. There continues to be a differentiation between finance leases and operating leases. However, the principal difference
from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the balance
sheet. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. We adopted ASU 2016-02 effective
January 1, 2019. ASU No. 2016-02 has not had any significant effect on our financial statements for the periods presented.

On
July 13, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-11. Among
other things, ASU 2017-11 provides guidance that eliminates the requirement to consider “down round” features when determining
whether certain financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entity’s stock and need to be classified as liabilities.
ASU 2017-11 provides for entities to recognize the effect of a down round feature only when it is triggered and then as a dividend and
a reduction to income available to common stockholders in basic earnings per share. The guidance was effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018; early adoption was permitted.
The
Company early adopted ASU 2017-11. As a result, we have not recognized the fair value of the warrants containing down round features
as liabilities. Please see NOTE K - CAPITAL STOCK for further information.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

On
October 14, 2021, the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (“NPA”) with each of
BHP Capital NY Inc. and Quick Capital, LLC (together, the “Investors”) and issued each of the Investors a Secured Convertible
Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven and NO/100 Dollars
($666,667). The Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time before maturity (October 14, 2022) at
the option of the holder at the Fixed Conversion Price that shall be the lesser of: (a) $15.00 or (b) 70% multiplied by the Market
Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 30%) (the “Fixed Conversion Price”). “Market Price”
means the average of the two lowest Closing Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day period
ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date “Trading Day” shall mean any day on which the
Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCBB, OTCQB or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on
which the Common Stock is then being quoted or traded. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Borrower’s Common Stock closes
below the par value per share, the Borrower will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the
par value of the Common Stock to the lowest value possible under law. The Borrower agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending
this adjustment. If the shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock have not been delivered within three (3) business days to the
Holder, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded by the Holder. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such
date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the
Holder for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. If at
any time the Conversion Price as determined hereunder for any conversion would be less than the par value of the Common Stock, then
at the sole discretion of the Holder, the Conversion Price hereunder may equal such par value for such conversion and the Conversion
Amount for such conversion may be increased to include Additional Principal, where “Additional Principal” means such
additional amount to be added to the Conversion Amount to the extent necessary to cause the number of conversion shares issuable
upon such conversion to equal the same number of conversion shares as would have been issued had the Conversion Price not been adjusted
by the Holder to the par value price. The Note has a term of one (1) year and bears interest at 10% annually. As part and parcel
of the foregoing transaction, each of the Investors was issued 1,533 shares of common stock as Commitment shares and a warrant (the
“Warrant”) granting the holder the right to purchase up to 44,444 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise
price of $22.50 for a term of 5-years. The transaction closed on October 19, 2021 As of September 30, 2024, $39,388 principal was

due on the BHP note due October 14, 2022. On June 16, 2023, as part of an agreement reached with the SEC, BHP Capital agreed to surrender
all conversion rights in its currently held convertible notes, surrender for cancellation all unexercised warrants that it acquired
in connection with convertible notes, and surrender for cancellation any shares it holds that were acquired by converting notes or

The
above Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) contain a variable conversion feature based on the future trading price
of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes is indeterminate.
Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of the embedded conversion feature as a derivative liability at the respective issuance
dates of the Notes and charged the applicable amounts to debt discount and the remainder to other expense. The increase (decrease) in
the fair value of the derivative liability from the respective issuance date of the Notes to the measurement date is charged (credited)
to other expense (income).
On
June 16, 2023, as part of an agreement reached with the SEC, BHP Capital agreed to surrender all conversion rights in its currently held
convertible notes, surrender for cancellation all unexercised warrants that it acquired in connection with convertible notes, and surrender
for cancellation any shares it holds that were acquired by converting notes or exercising related warrants.
The
fair value of the derivative liability was measured at the respective issuance date and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 using
the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at September 30,
2024 were (1) stock price of $0.0594 per share, (2) conversion price of $0.01911 per share, (3) term of 30 days, (4) expected volatility
of 143% and (5) risk free interest rate of 4.93%. Assumptions used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at December
31, 2023 were (1) stock price of $0.03 per share, (2) conversion price of $0.01414 per share, (3) term of 30 days, (4) expected volatility

Based
on management’s present assessment, the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset
attributable to the future utilization of the net operating loss carryforward as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 will be realized.
Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% allowance against the deferred tax asset in the financial statements at December 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate.
The
net operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2024 for the years 2004 to 2017
expires in varying amounts from year 2024 to year 2037.
Current
tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs.
Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.

N - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY
Under
ASC 205-40, we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet
our future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required
by this standard, our evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of our plans that have
not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.
In
performing the first step of this assessment, we concluded that the following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to
meet our financial obligations as they become due. We have a history of net losses: As of December 31, 2024, we had cash of $72,842,
current assets of $189,441, current liabilities of $4,643,928 and an accumulated deficit of $13,882,863 For the twelve months ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of $1,198,810 and $690,140 respectively. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until
such time as our operating segments generate sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements.
In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships,
establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities,
including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM).
There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through November 2025.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from our failure to continue as a going concern.

acquiree.

October 1, 2017, Deep Green acquired Columbia Financial Services, Inc, (CFSI), a Portland, Oregon based company that finances the purchases
of waste and recycling equipment. Deep Green purchased 100% of the common stock for $597,300. $418,110 was paid in cash at closing and
a promissory note was executed in the amount of $179,190.
On
August 7, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Subsidiaries and Assumption of Obligations
(the “Agreement”) with Mirabile Corporate Holdings, Inc. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company transferred all capital
stock of its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Compaction and Recycling Equipment, Inc. and Columbia Financial Services, Inc., to Mirabile
Corporate Holdings, Inc. in exchange for the assumption and cancellation of certain liabilities. Deep Green’s then Chief Executive
Officer owned a 7.5% equity interest in Mirabile Corporate Holdings, Inc.
On
August 7, 2018, the Company ceased its waste recycling business.
The
Company re-launched its waste and recycling services operation and has begun to re-engage with customers, waste haulers and recycling
centers, which are critical elements of its historically successful business model: designing and managing waste programs for commercial
and institutional properties for cost savings, ease of operation, and minimal administrative stress for its clients.
32
Asset
Purchase Agreement
On
February 8, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DG Research, Inc. (the “Buyer”), entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Amwaste, Inc. (the “Seller”). Under the terms of the Agreement, the
Buyer agreed to purchase from the Seller certain assets (the “Assets”) utilized in the Seller’s waste management business
located in Glynn County, Georgia. In consideration for the purchase of the Assets, the Buyer paid the seller $160,000 and issued the
Seller 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock. The Buyer remitted $50,000 at Closing and issued the Seller a
Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of $110,000, which was paid April 9, 2021. The Note was secured by the Assets
purchased through the Agreement. The transaction closed on February 11, 2021.
In
order to further grow its business, the Company plans to:
●
expand
its service offerings to provide additional sustainable waste management solutions that further minimize costs based on volume and
content of waste streams, and methods of disposal, including landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers;
●
Acquire
profitable waste and recycling services companies with similar or compatible and synergistic business models, that can help the Company
achieve these objectives;
●
Offer
innovative recycling services that significantly reduce the disposal of plastics, electronic wastes, food wastes, and hazardous wastes
in the commercial property universe;
●
Establish
partnerships with innovative universities, municipalities and companies; and
●
Attract
investment funds who will actively work with the Company to achieve these goals and help the Company grow into a leading waste and
recycling services supplier in North America.
Some
potential merger/acquisition candidates have been identified and discussions initiated. These candidates are within the Company’s
core business model, serving commercial properties, accretive to cash flow, and geographically favorable. While seeking to identify acquisition
candidates, the Company seeks to identify target entities with a similar core business model or a model which naturally integrates with
its own, and which are situated in opportunistic geographic locations.
We
have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities,
economic conditions, and other factors.
The
selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may
find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity
which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our
management’s best business judgment.
Our
activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business
and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the
consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and
our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or
GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require our most significant,
difficult and subjective judgments have an impact on revenue recognition, the determination of share-based compensation and financial
instruments. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K.

Revenues
For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated $1,081,615 and $2,682,762 revenue, respectively. In 3rd quarter
2023, we began work on the Oxford House Project at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). As a result, our 3rd quarter
2023 asbestos-related revenues were substantially greater than 3Q 2024. YTD 2024 revenues for other channels, such as Mold, Lead and
Radon channels were all up, 90%, 197% and 40% respectively.
Cost
of Sales
Our
cost of sales was $255,665 and $637,068 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This highlights our low
cost of performing remediation work and again references the significance of the Oxford House project in 2023
Gross
Profit
Full
year gross profit dropped to $825,950 from $2,045,694 the prior year. So even though our other revenue channels outperformed year-over-year,
we were not able to compensate for the considerable 2023 VUMC project.
Operating
expenses
Our
operating expenses of $1,789,346 are down from $2,305,008 year-over-year which was driven almost exclusively by 2023 non-cash stock compensation.
This was offset by intentional increases in facilities cost and a catch up for employee incentive accrual of $95K
Operating
Loss
Our
operating loss was ($963,396) and ($259,314) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We
anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in 2024 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to build out our remediation
services and identify acquisition opportunities in the waste and recycling sector.
Other
Income (Expense)
Other
Income was essentially flat at $426,718 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. This was driven by noncash derivative adjustment
and gain from disposition of Amwaste operations.
Net
Income
The
Company’s loss was $(1,390,114) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss of $(690,140) for the same period
in 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
At
December 31, 2024, we had current assets of $189,441 and current liabilities of $4,835,663 resulting in negative working capital of $4,646,222,
of which $2,901,424 was accounts payable and $131,356 was included in accrued interest. At December 31, 2024, we had total assets of
$921,5184 and total liabilities of $4,966,278 resulting in stockholders’ deficit of $(4,044,760).
At
December 31, 2023, we had current assets of $1,193,986 and current liabilities of $5,421,592 resulting in negative working capital of
$4,227,606, of which $3,028,905 was accounts payable and $102,286 was included in deferred compensation. At December 31, 2023, we had
total assets of $2,121,542 and total liabilities of $5,421,592 resulting in stockholders’ deficit of $(3,300,050).
Accounts
Payable
At
December 31, 2024, the Company had accounts payable of $2,901,424 that consisted of $487,615 in default judgments due to prior vendors,
$2,181,877 due to vendors for materials and services and $220,069 due for credit card obligations.
At
December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts payable of $3,028,905 that consisted of $487,615 in default judgments due to prior vendors,
$2,325,693 due to vendors for materials and services and $215,597 due for credit card obligations.
Debt
At
December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding secured notes and convertible notes payable of $682,768 and other debt of $467,062. Please
see NOTE H – DEBT and NOTE I - SECURED NOTES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE for further information.
At
December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding secured notes and convertible notes payable of $971,788 and other debt of $575,077. Please
see NOTE H – DEBT and NOTE I- SECURED NOTES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE for further information.
Cash
on Hand
Our
cash on hand as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $72,842 and $318,441, respectively.
Satisfaction
of Outstanding Liabilities
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company has a liability of $487,615 as a result of three (3) default judgments. The Company intends to negotiate
settlements and establish payment plans with each creditor that will satisfy these judgements. Nonetheless, some or all of the creditors
may elect to bring further litigation to protect their claims or perfect their judgments.
The
Company accrued customer deposits in the form of advance payments for waste management services that could not be delivered when the
Company suspended operations in August 2018. The Company intends to either resume waste management services with those customers or refund
the advance payments through a repayment plan.
There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds
will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to satisfy these outstanding liabilities.
The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources
would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
35
We
currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that
will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital.
We
are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for
our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the
form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees.
If
we are unable to raise the funds, we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have
not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing
in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we
are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we
fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.
Our
independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes
that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. Please see NOTE
N - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY for further information.
Debt
Our
Debt was $467,062 and $575,077 at December 31 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included within the Debt was the following at
December 31, 2024: (i) $387,535 due under Factor agreement with AEC Yield Capital, LLC and Notice of Default; (ii) $51,179 in other debt.
Please see NOTE H – DEBT for further information.
Convertible
Notes
On
October 14, 2021, the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (“NPA”) with each of BHP
Capital NY Inc. and Quick Capital, LLC (together, the “Investors”) and issued each of the Investors a Secured Convertible
Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven and NO/100 Dollars ($666,667).
The Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time before maturity (October 14, 2022) at the option of the
holder at the Fixed Conversion Price that shall be the lesser of: (a) $0.01 or (b) 70% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein)
(representing a discount rate of 30%) (the “Fixed Conversion Price”). “Market Price” means the average of the
two lowest Closing Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete
Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date “Trading Day” shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period
on the OTCBB, OTCQB or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being quoted
or traded. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Borrower’s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Borrower
will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value of the Common Stock to the lowest value
possible under law. The Borrower agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this adjustment. If the shares of the Borrower’s
Common Stock have not been delivered within three (3) business days to the Holder, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded by the Holder.
If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the
fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the Holder for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in
order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. If at any time the Conversion Price as determined hereunder for any conversion
would be less than the par value of the Common Stock, then at the sole discretion of the Holder, the Conversion Price hereunder may equal
such par value for such conversion and the Conversion Amount for such conversion may be increased to include Additional Principal, where
“Additional Principal” means such additional amount to be added to the Conversion Amount to the extent necessary to cause
the number of conversion shares issuable upon such conversion to equal the same number of conversion shares as would have been issued
had the Conversion Price not been adjusted by the Holder to the par value price. The Note has a term of one (1) year and bears interest
at 10% annually. As part and parcel of the foregoing transaction, each of the Investors was issued 1,533 shares of common stock as Commitment
shares and a warrant (the “Warrant”) granting the holder the right to purchase up to 44,444 shares of the Company’s
common stock at an exercise price of $22.50 for a term of 5-years. The transaction closed on October 19, 2021 As of June 30, 2024, $39,388
principal was due on the Quick Capital Note and $69,900 principal was due on the BHP Capital Note.
36
Cash
Flows
We
had net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $41,446 and $ 253,414,
respectively.
We
had net cash provided in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $135,213 and $51,585, respectively.
First quarter 2024 proceeds were from the sale of Amwaste rolloff operations.
We
had net cash provided (used) by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $(426,442) and $(23,174),
respectively. First quarter use of funds were used to pay back the 2023 funding that was needed for our large remediation project at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Required
Capital Over the Next Twelve Months
We
expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We believe we will have to raise an additional $500,000 to expand our operations
over the next twelve months, including roughly $50,000 to remain current in our filings with the SEC. The additional funds will be utilized
for hiring ancillary staff and key personnel, corporate website and SEO development, acquisition(s) in the waste and recycling management
sector and day-to-day operations.
Future
financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if
we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash
requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing
holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of our securities.
If
additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay or alter our business plan
based on available financing.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies”
suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting
Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s
financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant
policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and (ii) the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management expects to
make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting
the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that
our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and
assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any relationships with any organizations or financial partnerships,
such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company’s management, including the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s President concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including
the Company’s President, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On
December 31, 2022, management became aware of a Summons of Notice filed by Owen May and MD Global Partners with the State of New York
which names Lloyd T. Spencer and Deep Green Waste & Recycling. The summons claims breach of contract and other unsubstantiated accusations
seeking $350,000 in compensatory damages and $3,500,000 in punitive damages. Deep Green retained legal counsel in Manhattan, NY to refute
the claims. On 5/29/2024, a Stipulation to Discontinue with Prejudice was filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and
accepted on May 30, 2024.
Other
than the aforementioned case which has now been dismissed, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor are we aware
of any pending litigation or legal proceeding against us that would have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or
financial condition.
