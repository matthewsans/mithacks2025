(the “Company”) that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions about the Company’s business. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “sees,” “estimates” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and elsewhere in this Report as well as those discussed from time to time in the Company’s other Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report.

BUSINESS Background Xenous Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on May 20, 1980 as Dayne Weiss and Associates, Inc. under the laws of the State of Utah.  On January 4, 1990, the Company acquired Concept Technologies, Inc. (CTI) which then became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. CTI was dissolved in January 1991 and the name of Company was changed to Concept Technologies, Inc. On December 19, 2014, the Company completed a change of domiciliary merger and moved the Company’s state of incorporation to Nevada changing the name to Concept Holding Corporation. On July 21, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company elected to file Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it would enter into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, M101 Corp., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200, et seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to “M101 Corp.” The merger took effect on August 14, 2017. The Company currently has no business operations. On November 2, 2019, a majority of shareholders approved a resolution to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2019, the Company received notice that the Secretary of State of Nevada accepted the Company’s Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. Since its merger on August 14, 2017, the Company had no business operations.  Description of Business  We are currently seeking and investigating potential assets, property or businesses to acquire. We currently have no material business operations. Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected. We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor, and will be unable to do so until we determine any particular industry in which we may engage. We are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition. In our present form, we are deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company. We do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular business or industry, and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers may include all lawful businesses. We recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us may be extremely limited, and may be restricted as to acquisitions, reorganizations and mergers with businesses or entities that desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering (“IPO”) as a method of going public. The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares, the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking, state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities, along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations and federal and state agencies that implement such laws, rules and regulations.  Any target acquisition or merger candidate will become subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company following finalization of an acquisition or merger. Thus, in the event the Company successfully completes the acquisition of or merger with an operating business, that business must provide audited financial statements for at least the two most recent fiscal years or, in the event it has been in business for less than two years, audited financial statements will be required from the period of inception. This could limit the Company’s potential target business opportunities due to the fact that many private businesses either do not have audited financial statements or are unable to produce audited statements without undo time and expense. See the caption “Regulations” hereinafter. Since the termination of its prior business, Xenous has had no operations other than seeking an acquisition or merger to bring an operating entity into the Company. The Company’s officers and directors do not propose to restrict their search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business in any industry. The Company has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.  4Table of Contents The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, the Company has only limited resources and may find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to Xenous and its stockholders. The Company’s officers and directors will select any potential business opportunity based on their business judgment. The Company is not currently conducting any business, nor has it conducted any business for several years. Therefore, it does not possess products or services, distribution methods, competitive business positions, or major customers. The Company does not possess any unexpired patents or trademarks. The Company does not have any employees. Amendments to Form 8-K by the SEC regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies that require the filing of all information about an acquired company that would have been required to have been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 with the SEC, along with required audited, interim and pro forma financial statements, within four business days of the closing of any such transaction (Item 5.01(a)(8) of Form 8-K); and the amendments to Rule 144 adopted by the SEC, effective on February 15, 2008, limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one year after the filing of such information, may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of going public transactions. These types of transactions are customarily referred to as “reverse” reorganizations or mergers in which the acquired company’s shareholders become controlling shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company becomes the successor to the business operations of the acquired company. Regulations governing shell companies also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities and limit the use of this Form to a reorganized “shell company” until the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such instances, there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expense that are normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers. Amendments to Rule 144, adopted by the SEC and effective on February 15, 2008, codify the SEC’s prior position limiting the tradability of certain securities of shell companies, including those issued by us in any acquisition, reorganization or merger, and further limit the tradability of additional securities of shell companies; these proposals will further restrict the availability of opportunities for us to acquire any business or enterprise that desire to utilize us as a means of going public. Any of these types of transactions, regardless of the particular prospect, would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock and result in substantial dilution to current shareholders. Our management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor, none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success. These may include, but will not be limited to, as applicable, an analysis of the quality of the particular business or entity’s management and personnel; the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that any such business or company may have; the merits of any such business’ or company’s technological changes; the present financial condition, projected growth potential and available technical, financial and managerial resources of any such business or company; working capital, history of operations and future prospects; the nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of any such business’ or company’s management services and the depth of management; the business’ or the company’s potential for further research, development or exploration; risk factors specifically related to the business’ or company’s operations; the potential for growth, expansion and profit of the business or company; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of the company’s or the business’ products, services, trademarks and name identification; and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to properly or accurately quantify or analyze, let alone describe or identify, without referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business or company. Regardless, the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by reason of changing market strategies, plant or product expansion, changes in product emphasis, future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors. Further, in the case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and development mode, the risks will be substantial, and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business objectives. Also, a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established, and with no past track record, the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty.  5Table of Contents Our management will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded to us, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of information provided and gathered, check references of management and key personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity; however, due to time constraints of management, these activities may be limited. We are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor. We anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities, venture capital personnel and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates. In this event, such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.  Although we currently have no plans to do so, depending on the nature and extent of services rendered, we may compensate members of management in the future for services that they may perform for us. Because we currently have extremely limited resources, and we are unlikely to have any significant resources until we have determined a business or enterprise to engage in or have completed a reorganization, merger or acquisition, management expects that any such compensation would take the form of an issuance of shares of our common stock to these persons; this would have the effect of further diluting the holdings of our other stockholders. There are presently no preliminary agreements or understandings between us and members of our management respecting such compensation. Any shares issued to members of our management would be required to be resold under an effective registration statement filed with the SEC or 12 months after we file the “Form 10 Information” about the acquired company with the SEC as now required by Form 8-K. These provisions could further inhibit our ability to complete the acquisition of any business or complete any merger or reorganization with another entity, where finders or others who may be subject to these resale limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close any such transactions unless they are paid requested fees in cash or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the SEC that includes any shares that are to be issued to them, at no cost to them. These expenses could limit potential acquisition candidates, especially those in need of cash resources, and could affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain following any such transaction, by reason of the increased expense. Substantial fees are also often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a small amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. These fees are usually divided among consultants, brokers and selling shareholders, after deduction of legal, accounting and other related expenses, and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of their shares of our common stock that are owned by them or to provide an indemnification for all of our prior liabilities. Management may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their shares of common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out transaction. In the event that any such fees are paid or shares are purchased, these requirements may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us and, accordingly, may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals. We have no definitive arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities. Any of these types of fees that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale limitations embodied in the recent amendments to Rule 144. Our directors and executive officers are evaluating potential merger targets, but as of the date of this report no definitive plans for a merger are in force.  6Table of Contents Recent Developments Since the initial announcement on regarding the proposed acquisition of Dadvance Agarwood Alpha Sdn Bhd (“Dadvance”) on November 14, 2022 and even when the initial negotiation was unsuccessful, the Company has maintained an active and comprehensive evaluation process. While significant progress has been made in assessing the commercial viability and strategic fit of the acquisition, no definitive transaction has been finalized as of the date of this Annual Report. Following the completion of an independent valuation by YYC Advisors in December 2022 and preliminary legal reviews in late 2023, the Company entered into a non-binding term sheet with Dadvance to facilitate further due diligence and strategic assessment. The Company continues to closely monitor Dadvance’s operational growth, market engagement, and product acceptance in key international markets, particularly in the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Key developments of Dadvance during the ongoing evaluation include but not limited to the followings:  ·Market Penetration: Dadvance has made notable progress in expanding its presence in the European and Gulf Arab markets. This includes preliminary sales and distribution arrangements established through third-party partners. Sample shipments and product test batches have received positive feedback from potential bulk buyers in the UAE and Germany.    ·Product Quality Recognition: The Bioaromatic Research Centre of Universiti Malaysia Pahang has certified Dadvance’s agarwood oil as A+ grade, affirming its premium quality.    ·Production Scale-Up: Dadvance has commenced the phased installation of new distillation units with the objective of scaling production capacity in anticipation of increased demand. Notwithstanding, the sustained utilization of this expanded capacity is contingent upon the successful conversion of existing sales prospects into binding purchase agreements.    ·Brand & Wellness Segment Exploration: Dadvance is undertaking exploratory initiatives to develop a proprietary consumer brand aimed at the wellness and luxury aromatherapy market segment. Preliminary research and development collaborations have been established with local institutions; however, commercialization efforts have not yet commenced. While the Company remains optimistic about the long-term potential of the agarwood industry and Dadvance’s strategic positioning within the industry, a final decision on the acquisition will be contingent upon:  ·Conversion of strategic leads into long-term, revenue-generating contracts;    ·Confirmation of supply chain scalability and fulfillment capabilities;    ·Completion of comprehensive market feasibility studies, particularly in core target regions; and    ·Receipt of an independent fairness opinion confirming the acquisition’s value and fairness. The Board of Directors continues to regard Dadvance as a promising target aligned with the Company’s diversification and growth strategy. However, consistent with the Company’s prudent approach to capital allocation and risk management, no definitive agreement will be executed unless the commercial case is conclusively validated. The Company will issue further updates as the evaluation advances or upon the occurrence of any material developments. Principal Products or Services and Their Markets  None. Distribution Methods of the Products or Services  None.  7Table of Contents Status of any Publicly Announced New Product or Service  None. Competitive Business Conditions and Small or Reporting Company’s Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition  Our management believes that there are a large number of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us; many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves. Competitors also include thousands of other publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger. There is no reasonable way to assess and predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors; however, we, having limited assets and no cash reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with entities that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers  None. Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers  None. Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, including Duration  None. Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services  Since we currently have no business operations and produce no products nor provide any services, we are not presently subject to any governmental regulation in this regard. However, in the event that we complete a reorganization, merger or acquisition transaction with an entity that is engaged in business operations or provides products or services, we will become subject to all governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized, merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject. Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business  Smaller Reporting Company We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K. Sarbanes-Oxley Act We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.  8Table of Contents Exchange Act Reporting Requirements Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the our stockholders. We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Research and Development Costs During the Last Two Fiscal Years  None. Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws  We do not believe that our current or intended business operations are subject to any material environmental laws, rules or regulations that would have an adverse material effect on our business operations or financial condition or result in a material compliance cost; however, we will become subject to all such governmental requirements to which the reorganized, merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject. Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees  None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY  We are currently seeking and investigating potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and currently have no material business operations. As such, we have very limited information technology systems and infrastructure in place to assist with our search with potential assets, property or businesses to acquire. Further, we have very limited cybersecurity measures in place, such as, firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or mitigating the impact of a cyber-attack or data breach. We cannot predict the occurrence, timing, or severity of cybersecurity incidents, but we remain committed to protecting our information assets and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders.   ITEM 2. PROPERTIES  The Company uses office space at Room 1120, 11th Floor, Peninsula Centre, 67 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, East Kowloon, Hong Kong. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  There are no legal proceedings which are pending or have been threatened against us or any of our officers, directors or control persons of which management is aware. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  Not applicable.  9Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES  Market Information Xenous Holdings, Inc.’s Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol “XITO.” Xenous Holdings, Inc. has previously issued shares of common stock that constitute restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act. Subject to certain restrictions, such securities may generally be sold in limited amounts under Rule 144. As of June 20, 2025, Xenous Holdings, Inc. had 760,250,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, all of which were issued more than twelve months ago. All of these shares would generally be available for resale. Currently, Rule 144 would not be available for 707,050,000 of those shares until at least one year after a merger with an operating company or the creation of business operations by the Company and the filing of an 8-K containing certain information required in a Form 10 filing. As such timing of the availability of resale exemptions for these shares is unknown and currently they are not available for resale under Rule 144. When the shares potentially become available for resale, there could be a depressive effect of any market that may develop for the Company’s common stock given the amount of shares that would be available for resale versus the number currently available. There is currently no established trading market for shares of our common stock. Management does not expect any viable market to develop in our common stock unless and until we complete an acquisition or merger. In any event, no assurance can be given that any market for our common stock will develop or be maintained. For any market that develops for our common stock, the sale of “restricted securities” (common stock) pursuant to Rule 144 of the SEC by members of management or any other person to whom any such securities may be issued in the future may have a substantial adverse impact on any such public market.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  When used in this Annual Report, the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “continue,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act and Section 21e of the Exchange Act regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this Annual Report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed further below under “Trends and Uncertainties,” and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of operations. Plan of Operation Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected. During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing or the payment of expenses associated with legal fees, accounting fees and reviewing or investigating any potential business venture, which may be advanced by management or principal stockholders as loans to us. Because we have not determined any business or industry in which our operations will be commenced, and we have not identified any prospective venture as of the date of this Annual Report, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan. Any such loan will be on terms no less favorable to us than would be available from a commercial lender in an arm’s length transaction. No advance or loan from any affiliate will be required to be repaid as a condition to any agreement with future acquisition partners.  11Table of Contents Results of Operations  Years Ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024    Year  Year     Ended  Ended     March 31,  March 31,     2025  2024  Changes           Operating Expenses $64,456  $63,746  $710 Net Loss $(64,456) $(63,746 ) $(710) We had no operations during the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing. We had a net loss of $64,456 and $63,746 for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in professional fees incurred during the year ended March 31, 2024. Professional fees were $62,895 and $62,040 for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources   As of  As of     March 31,  March 31,     2025  2024  Changes           Current Asset $-  $-  $- Current Liabilities $903,622  $839,166  $64,456 Working Capital Deficiency $(903,622) $(839,166 ) $(64,456) We had no asset as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, our total liabilities were $903,622 and $839,166, respectively. Stockholders’ deficit was at $903,622 as of March 31, 2025 compared to deficit of $839,166 as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, we had a working capital deficit of $903,622 compared with a working capital deficit of $839,166 as of March 31, 2024. The increase in working capital deficit was primarily attributed by the increase in amount due to related party for advancement from the Company’s majority shareholder paying off vendors on behalf of the Company.   Year  Year     Ended  Ended     March 31,  March 31,     2025  2024  Changes           Net cash used in operating activities $(63,637) $(54,627 ) $(9,010)Net cash provided by financing activities $63,637  $54,627  $9,010 Net changes in cash and cash equivalents $-  $-  $-   12Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities  We have not generated any positive cash flow from operating activities.  For the year ended March 31, 2025, net cash flows used in operating activities was $63,637. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2025 was attributed by a net loss of $64,456, decreased by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $819.  For the year ended March 31, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was $54,627. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was attributed by a net loss of $63,746, decreased by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $9,119. Cash Flow from Financing Activities We have financed our operations primarily from advances and loans from related party.  For the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, net cash from financing activities was $63,637 and $54,627 for advancement from Smartex Investment Ltd., the majority shareholder of the Company, respectively. Going Concern Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit issued in connection with the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025, relative to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company, which has not generated any revenues, has incurred net losses, has nominal assets and a stockholders’ deficit. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty The Company is dependent on advances from its principal shareholders or other affiliated parties for continued funding. There are no commitments or guarantees from any third party to provide such funding nor is there any guarantee that the Company will be able to access the funding it requires to continue its operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). ITEM 8.

(the Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt About the Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $64,456 for the year ended March 31, 2025 and has negative working capital of $903,622 and as of March 31, 2025, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,241,422. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical matters.  /s/ JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT (PCAOB: 6723) We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.

(the “Company”) was incorporated on May 20, 1980 as Dayne Weiss and Associates, Inc. under the laws of the State of Utah. On December 19, 2014, the Company completed a change of domicile merger with Concept Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation, which became the surviving entity. On July 21, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company elected to file Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it would enter into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, M101 Corp., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200, et seq. The effect of such merger is the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to “M101 Corp.” The merger took effect on August 14, 2017. On November 2, 2019, a majority of shareholders approved a resolution to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2019, the Company received notice that the Secretary of State of Nevada accepted the Company’s Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. The Company currently has no business operations. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) of the United States. Use of Estimates The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with “GAAP,” which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. These tiers include: Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; andLevel 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of accounts payable and debts. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260, ”Earnings per Share,”(“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  F-7Table of Contents As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not have any potentially dilutive securities. Related Parties We follow ASC 850,“Related Party Disclosures” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. (see Note 4). Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Pursuant to ASC 740 deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. ASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. At March 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. (see Note 6) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which require public companies disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. We do not believe that this accounting pronouncement will have any material impact on our financial statements or disclosures upon adoption.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN The Company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has an operating loss and net loss of $64,456 for the year ended March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the Company has accumulated deficit of $1,214,422, negative operating cash flow of $63,637 and negative working capital of $903,622. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its operation plan to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its major shareholder or other sources, as may be required. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.  F-8Table of Contents The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Due to Related Party During the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, Smartex Investment Ltd., the majority shareholder of the Company which is holding 82% of the Company’s common shares, advanced $63,637 and $54,627, respectively, to the Company for operating expenses. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, total amount due to Smartex Investment Ltd. was $879,718 and $816,081 respectively. The loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand. NOTE 5 – SHARE CAPITAL Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, no preferred shares have been issued. Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. There were no stock issuances during the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the Company had 760,250,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. NOTE 6 – INCOME TAX The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. The components of the Company’s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, are as follows:   March 31,  March 31,   2025  2024 Net operating loss carryforward $(869,485) $(805,029)Tax Rate  21%  21%Deferred tax asset  (182,592)  (169,056)Less: Valuation allowance  182,592   169,056 Deferred tax asset $-  $-   F-9Table of Contents  As of March 31, 2025, the Company had approximately $870,000 of the U.S. net operating losses (the “U.S. NOLs”), which begin to expire between 2035 and 2040. NOLs generated in tax years prior to March 31, 2018, can be carried forward for twenty years, whereas NOLs generated after March 31, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. In accordance with Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the usage of the Company’s net operating loss carry forwards is subject to annual limitations following greater than 50% ownership changes. Tax returns for the years ended 2014 through 2025 are subject to review by the tax authorities. NOTE 7 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to March 31, 2025 to the date these financial statements were issued and has determined that it does not have other material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements except as stated below: In November 2022, the Company announced that it was conducting a full financial and legal due diligence of a Malaysia-based company involving the plantations, inoculations, cultivations, manufacturing, marketing, trading and conducting research and development of agricultural commodities in relation to Aquilaria trees and its related products. The preliminary due diligence for its target acquisition company has been successfully completed. This critical first phase has yielded a positive outcome, confirming our confidence in the potential value of the target company. The Company is now progressing with further due diligence, specifically focusing on the intangible assets and the valuation of these assets. This thorough assessment is essential to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the acquisition target. The due diligence process is expected to be completed by the first half of calendar year 2025. Following the successful conclusion of this final phase, the acquisition will proceed formally, in line with our previous announcements. The Company remains committed to transparency and will continue to keep stakeholders informed of any significant developments. We appreciate the ongoing support from our investors, partners, and customers as we move forward with this strategic acquisition.  F-10Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, consisting of officers and directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the President and Secretary/Treasurer, concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Security and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B.
