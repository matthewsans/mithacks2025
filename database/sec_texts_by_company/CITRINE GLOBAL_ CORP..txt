rates observed in studies conducted with elderly people demonstrating that oral cavity-related symptoms are linked to different factors,

in the oral cavity. Saliva contains calcium and phosphorous which protects teeth, helps the digestive system, prevents bad smell through
balancing the acidity that comes from food and bacteria, has enzymes that help break down food, washes food scraps and bacteria, and
helps speech as pronunciation of movements and syllables is done with saliva and tongue.

The
Health & Wellness Industries Global Market Size and Potential:
The
global health and wellness market is expected to reach USD 7.6 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2021 to 2030. The hectic,
unbalanced lifestyle has resulted in the prevalence of lack of proper diet and sleep, stress, depression, anxiety, cancer, diabetes,
and various other health related issues. Lack of proper diet has resulted in the reduced intake of essential nutrients and minerals required
for the healthy and active functioning of the human body. Precedence research identifies growth opportunities to the health and wellness
market players across the globe in the adoption of smart technologies and innovative ways in manufacturing various health and wellness
products, nutritional supplements, healthy snacks and beverages, the growing biopharmaceutical industry and development of botanical
drugs11.
The
Plant-Based Global Market Size and Potential:

natural superfoods, beverages, cosmetics and the evolving market for botanical and plant-derived drugs.
The
Global Nutritional Supplements Market12
The
global nutritional supplements market is expected to reach USD 624.7 billion by 2030 and is expanding growth at a CAGR of 7.1% over the
forecast period 2021 to 2030 with plant-based supplements containing natural ingredients and extracts of plants and mushrooms that have
a beneficial biological effect. The global superfoods market is expected to reach USD 214.95 billion by 2027 with superfoods
being foods that have a very high nutritional density. This means they provide a substantial amount of nutrients and very few calories.
They contain a high volume of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.
Growth
in the nutritional supplements’ market is driven by growing awareness of health and safety in the traditional pharma, food, and beverage industries
as well as higher healthcare costs. Authentic consumption has become a major food and beverage trend as consumers increasingly seek natural
ingredients. Products such as ginseng, echinacea, ginkgo biloba, and garlic, the top selling botanical products, are considered natural
remedies for inflammation and infections. This is also driving growth of vitamins and minerals and moving towards natural colorant-based
plant juice products, since they provide better and long-lasting protection from viruses and bacteria. In addition, botanicals and nutritional
supplements are widely used by people who suffer from diseases related to weight management, clinical nutrition, digestive health (gut
health problems), immunity, diabetes, and cardio fitness, either as treatment or prevention13.

The
Botanical and Plant-derived Drug Market14
The
global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is anticipated to grow to $53 billion by 2026 driven by growing applications in diseases,
technological developments in manufacturing processes and a growing focus and demand for naturally sourced medicines.
Botanical
drugs are derived from natural sources, plants and mushrooms, and are considered to have fewer side-effects as compared to synthetic
drugs while showing high efficacy in helping to treat different medical conditions and chronic diseases.
The
important driver for growth in the global botanical and plant-derivative drug market is its growing applications in diseases. Botanical
drugs are derivative of medicinal plants and may contain algae and vegetable substances, along with macroscopic fungi. These may assist
in the treatment of various diseases, such as central nervous system disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory
diseases. Botanical and plant derivative drugs are available in various forms, such as pills, tablets, and injections.
The
Botanical and plant-derivative drug market is primarily driven by the following factors
●
Growing
applications in diseases

●
Rising
demand for traditional medicines
●
Growing
focus on natural source medicines
The
Global Natural Cosmetics Market15
The
global natural cosmetics market is projected to reach USD 24.86 billion by 2028 driven mainly by increasing demand for harmful chemical-free
cosmetics, rising awareness against the use of animal derivatives and growing social media movements endorsing naturally derived products.
The
cosmetic and personal care segment of botanicals is also on the rise with companies increasingly discovering novel herbal ingredients
as consumers are seeking more natural products with ingredients that are of plant origin: extracts or oils obtained from raw plant materials.
Natural cosmetics are cosmetics that have ingredients of plant origin. The absence of chemical compounds and animal-by products are specifically
suited to sensitive skin people. The natural cosmetic products are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Many companies in the
field focus on the production of natural cosmetics that are cruelty-free as these products have increasing demand.
Regulatory
Environment
In
every jurisdiction in which we plan to operate, we will be subject to extensive governmental regulations on the formulation, manufacturing,
packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, shipping, and selling our products, may they be nutritional supplements,
cosmetics, foods, or any other category.
Prior
to commencing operations and/or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license, or
certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or another responsible agency. Prior to entering a new market, we
plan to work with local authorities, either directly or via our local partner, to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process
usually requires us to present each product and product ingredients and, in some cases, arrange for testing of products by local technicians
for ingredient analysis.

We
or our local partners would need to obtain various regulatory approvals and licenses for our different product lines and activities,
including production of botanicals, nutritional supplements, natural snacks and beverages, and natural cosmetics. We intend to obtain
all regulatory approvals required for different product categories in the different countries in which we will operate either directly
or through our local partners.
Regulatory
Environment for the Products16
While
the number of people using nutritional supplements and herbal medicine products continues to increase in many countries, the regulations
for these products vary by territory. In some countries supplement use is limited to general health and well-being while in other countries
they are permitted for use as medicinal products. To date, there is little consensus from country to country on the scope, requirements,
definition, or even the terminology in which the nutritional supplement and herbal medicines categories could be classified.
Our
products are regulated in Israel as nutritional supplements and meet all regulatory compliance requirements for nutritional supplements
in Israel. iBOT Israel Botanicals, our manufacturing facility for our products, is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health and is
GMP-certified.
Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards.
GMP covers all aspects of production from the starting materials, premises, and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff.
Detailed written procedures are essential for each process that could affect the quality of the finished product. There must be systems
to provide documented proof that correct procedures are consistently followed at each step in the manufacturing process - every time
a product is manufactured. The National Food Service (NFS) is the regulatory body at the Israeli Ministry of Health, that is responsible for
food and nutritional supplements approval. The NFS strictly examines the safety and quality of each nutritional supplement product that
is about to be registered and marketed in Israel.
We
currently expect to launch our products in the US in the first half of 2024. We will obtain all relevant regulatory approvals for the
products before launching them in other territories
As of this time, the current war in Gaza has significantly affected the Israeli economy,
which has directly impacted our ability to launch our products in the US at this time. We shall revise and disclose our business plans
in the future given the local situation on the ground.
The
Israeli Ministry of Health maintains a comprehensive list of authorized nutritional supplements for marketing. This list includes over
a thousand different vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs including their extracts. Items under this list can be legally marketed,
however, no medical claims can be made without adequate supporting information. The final products can be in various forms such as powders,
tablets, hard or soft capsules, liquids, including oils and tinctures. Each product must be manufactured under GMP conditions and be
approved by the Ministry of Health prior to selling.

Our
Corporate History
We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 26, 2010 under the name “TechCare Corp.”.
On
January 6, 2020, our predecessor company, TechCare Corp., a Delaware corporation (“TechCare”), and Citrine S A L Investment
& Holdings Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a major shareholder of our company (“Citrine S A L”), and a group of related
persons and entities (the “Citrine S A L Group”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Citrine S A L
Group Agreement”), which was later amended and restated on February 23, 2020 (the “AR Citrine S A L Group Agreement”).
Pursuant to the AR Citrine Agreement, TechCare agreed to sell Citrine S A L Group and its group of business partners, up to an aggregate
of 893,699,276 shares of TechCare’s common stock, representing approximately 95% of TechCare’s fully diluted capital, in
two tranches, with the initial tranche of up to 452,063,196 shares of the TechCare’s common stock to be sold conditioned upon (i)
the resignation of the then members of its board of directors, (ii) the appointment of the current members of the Board, and (iii) the
transfer of the TechCare’s signatory rights to all Company bank accounts in the name of Citrine S A L Group’s nominee. In
addition, the AR Citrine S A L Group Agreement provides for the second tranche of up to the remaining number of shares of common stock
that will result in Citrine S A L Group, owning 95% of the TechCare’s fully diluted capital stock, to be sold conditioned upon
the filing of the Company’s previously approved amendment to its First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the Company’s authorized capital. Shares of the Company were issued and sold in accordance with this amended agreement to Citrine
S A L Group on February 27, 2020, March 5, 2020, and, after the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized
share capital, on November 11, 2020.
ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
You
should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could
be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.
Risks
Related to our Financial position
We
have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in continuing to grow our business, then we may have to scale back or even
cease our ongoing business operations.
We
have been operating in our current business since March 2020. Accordingly, our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the
establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. As of December
31, 2023, we have not generated revenues and there can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable. If our business plan is not successful,
and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company.
We
expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the implementation of our business plan. If we fail to generate revenue
and eventually become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, our shareholders could lose all or a substantial
part of their investment.
Until
we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to finance
our cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or through the establishment of possible strategic
alliances. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure
additional equity funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate, development programs or future commercialization
initiatives.
In
addition, any additional equity funding that we do obtain will dilute the ownership held by our existing security holders. Any debt
financing that we obtain in the future could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek a pledge of some
or all of our assets. We have not identified potential sources for such financing that we will require, and we do not have commitments
from any third parties to provide any future debt financing. If we fail to obtain funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale
back operations, and our results, financial condition and stock price would be adversely affected.
We
may never achieve profitability.
We
are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of future revenue or expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability.
We have financed our operations primarily through issuance and sale of equity and equity linked securities. The size of our future net
losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth or contraction of our expenses and the level and rate of growth, if any, of our revenues.
We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on, among other things:
●
sales
and marketing, including expanding our indirect sales organization and marketing programs;
●
planning
and conducting clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval/clearance for the commercialization of our products;
●
expansion
of our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally; and
●
general
administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company.
If
we are unable to successfully commercialize our products or if revenue from any of our products that receives marketing approval is insufficient,
we will not achieve profitability. Furthermore, even if we successfully commercialize our products, our planned investments may not result
in increased revenue or growth of our business. We may not be able to generate net revenues sufficiently to offset our expected cost increases
and planned investments in our business. As a result, we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able
to achieve and sustain profitability. If we fail to achieve and sustain profitability, then we may not be able to achieve our business
plan, fund our business or continue as a going concern.
13
Currency
exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.
We
incur expenses in U.S. Dollars and in NIS, but our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. However, a significant portion of our headcount-related expenses, consisting principally of personnel expenses as well as R&D consulting services, leases and certain other operating
expenses, are denominated in NIS. This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of
the U.S. dollar against the NIS. Furthermore, we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in
NIS.
In
addition, increased international sales in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign
currency risk. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected. which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry and Regulatory Process
Our
failure to manage growth effectively could impair our business.
Our
business strategy envisions a period of rapid growth that may put a strain on our administrative and operational resources and funding
requirements. Our ability to effectively manage growth will require us to continue to expand the capabilities of our operational and
management systems and to attract, train, manage, and retain qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do
so, particularly if losses continue and we are unable to obtain sufficient financing. If we are unable to successfully manage growth,
our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our
plans are dependent upon key individuals and the ability to attract qualified personnel.
In
order to execute our business plan, we will be dependent on Ora Elharar Soffer, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. The loss of
Ms. Elharar Soffer could have a material adverse effect upon our business prospects. Moreover, our success continues to depend to a significant
extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel.

for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training,
and retaining such personnel in the future. If we are unable to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel in the future, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may also depend on third party contractors and
other partners to assist with the execution of our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in either attracting
and retaining qualified personnel or creating arrangements with such third parties. The failure to succeed in these endeavors would
have a material adverse effect on our ability to consummate our business plans.
Failure
in the Company’s information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly
disrupt its operations.
Our
operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems are
potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. Failure of our information technology
systems could adversely affect our business, profitability, and financial condition. Although we have information technology security
systems, a successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation and/or loss of confidential
or personal information, create system interruptions, or deploy malicious software that attacks our systems. It is possible that we do not notice a cybersecurity attack for some period. The occurrence of a cybersecurity attack or incident could result in business interruptions
from the disruption of the Company’s information technology systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with
its shareholders and other stakeholders and/or increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition,
the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information could expose the Company
or other third parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation, and potential liability, or otherwise harm its business.
We
may grow through mergers or acquisitions, which strategy may not be successful or, if successful, may produce risks in successfully integrating
and managing the merged companies or acquisition and may dilute our stockholders.
As
part of our growth strategy, we may pursue mergers and acquisitions of entities and/or assets that we believe will have synergistic and/or
other value to us. We currently have no agreements or understanding to merge with or acquire any entity and/or assets, and may not find
suitable merger or acquisition opportunities. Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business,
including, without limitation:
●
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target and realizing
the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses.
●
difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of the target company.
●
diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations.
●
the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated
the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity.
●
entering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience.
●
potential loss of key associates and customers from either our business or the target’s business.
●
assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities of the target; and
●
the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.
14
Mergers
and acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments
in the future and that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity
securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our common shares. As a result, if we fail
to properly evaluate mergers, acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such merger or acquisition,
and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments
or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
may be subject to product liability claims which may have a material adverse effect on our business
Through
our subsidiary Cannovation Center Israel, we developed product line containing natural and herbal formulas based on researched and
science-based plants, herbal extracts, mushrooms and other natural ingredients. The product lines are manufactured in Israel in iBOT
Israel Botanicals Ltd, iBOT being a related party with which we have manufacturing and strategic cooperation agreements, under a
GMP-certified manufacturing facility approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health. In the future we plan to develop additional
products which may be subject to different regulations for manufacturing, depending on country and product. As these products are
designed to be ingested by humans, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and
litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. A product liability claim or regulatory action
against us could result in increased costs, could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and consumers generally, and
could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results of the Company. There can be no
assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage
against potential liabilities. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect
against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products.
Product
recalls may harm our reputation.
Manufacturers
and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product
defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate
or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of our products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, we could
be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We
may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product
recall may require significant management attention. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing finished products, there
can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls,
regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by the Company were subject to recall, the image of that
product and the Company could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for products produced
by the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. Additionally,
product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of the operations of the Company by any applicable regulatory agencies, requiring further
management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.
Our
officers and directors may be subject to conflict of interest.
The
Company may be subject to various potential conflicts of interest because of the fact that some of its officers and directors may be
engaged in a range of business activities. In addition, the Company’s executive officers and directors may devote time to their
outside business interests, so long as such activities do not materially or adversely interfere with their duties to the Company. In
some cases, the Company’s executive officers and directors may have fiduciary obligations associated with these business interests
that interfere with their ability to devote time to the Company’s business and affairs and that could adversely affect the Company’s
operations. These business interests could require significant time and attention of the Company’s executive officers and directors.
In
addition, the Company may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of certain directors and the officers
who may from time-to-time deal with people, firms, institutions or companies with which the Company may be dealing, or which may be
seeking investments similar to those desired by it. The interests of these people could conflict with those of the Company. In addition,
from time to time, these people may be competing with the Company for available investment opportunities. Conflicts of interest, if
any, will be subject to the procedures and remedies provided under applicable laws. In particular, in the event that such a conflict
of interest arises at a meeting of the Company’s directors, a director who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or
against the approval of such participation or such terms. In accordance with applicable laws, the directors of the Company are required
to act honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.
We
face significant competition in the market.
We
face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing
experience than the Company. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the
business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company
We
may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage and in the case of liability the lack of adequate insurance may have a material
adverse effect on our business.
We
have insurance to protect our assets, operations and employees. While we believe our insurance coverage addresses all material risks
to which we may be exposed and is adequate and customary in our current state of operations, such insurance is subject to coverage limits
and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which the Company is exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given
that such insurance will be adequate to cover the Company’s liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available,
that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If the Company were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered
by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if the Company were to incur such liability at a time when it is not able to obtain
liability insurance, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
15
Research
and development and product obsolescence may impair our ability to compete in our target market.
Rapidly
changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products characterize our business. The introduction
of new products, embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render
our planned product offerings obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing our planned products is complex
and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments The Company’s failure to develop new
technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
operating results. The Company’s success will depend, in part, on its ability to continue to enhance its existing technologies,
develop new technology that addresses the increasing sophistication and varied needs of the market, and respond to technological advances
and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of the Company’s proprietary
technology entails significant technical and business risks. The Company may not be successful in using its new technologies or exploiting
its niche markets effectively or adapting its businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging industry
standards.
It
may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a U.S. court against us and our executive officers and directors in Israel or the United States,
to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or to serve process on our executive officers and directors.
While
we were incorporated in Delaware, all of our executive officers and directors reside outside of the United States, and all of our assets
and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us, or any of
these persons, including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible
in the United States and may not be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these
persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Additionally, it may be
difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with respect to U.S. securities laws in Israel. Israeli
courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate
forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law
and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proven
as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by
Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated
with enforcing a judgment against us in Israel, you may not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.
We
intend to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials (if needed). If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise
conduct the trials as required, our clinical trials programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory
approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.
We
may conduct clinical trials on our products. We do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our clinical trials ourselves. We may
rely upon medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract research organizations, or CROs, and consultants to conduct these
trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. Our future CROs, investigators and other third parties play a significant role in the
conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.
There
is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of clinical trials
will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet
expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be
extended, delayed or terminated. If any of these clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up
information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another
qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for any clinical trials we conduct may serve as scientific advisors
or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships
and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable
clinical trial site may be jeopardized.
We
will be subject to regulation of plant-based nutritional supplements, botanicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Our
products, solutions and Green Vision Center activities are subject to rules and regulations pertaining to plant-based nutritional supplements,
botanicals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, as applicable. The company cannot predict the time required to secure all appropriate
regulatory approvals or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by government authorities. Any delays in obtaining,
or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals would significantly delay the development of markets and products and could have a material
adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.
Risks
Related to our Intellectual Property
If
we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product offerings, or if the scope of the intellectual
property protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical
to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products may be impaired.
Our
ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, preserve
our trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents
on our products and other technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, and
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may not be able
to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patents or patent applications at a reasonable cost or in
a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions, or at all, or may choose not to do any of the foregoing.
16
Moreover,
while we have applied for a patent that protect aspects of our products in the United States but our products are not covered by any
patent protection, and we cannot assure you that our intellectual property position, will not be challenged or that all patents for which
we have applied will be issued on a timely basis or at all, or that such patents will protect our technology, in whole or in part, or
be issued in a form that will provide us with meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide
us with any competitive advantage. Although patents are presumed valid and enforceable upon issuance, a patent may be challenged as to
its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability.
Patent
applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases
not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the invention claimed in our pending patent application,
or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability,
and commercial value of our patent rights are uncertain. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory
review of new products, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized. As a
result, any patent portfolio we develop may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar
or identical to ours.
We
may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
There
is often litigation between competing companies relying on their respective technologies based on allegations of infringement or other
violations of intellectual property rights. Our future success depends, in part, on not infringing the intellectual property rights of
others. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology. Any such claims
or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial
damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering some portion of our products, or require that we comply with other unfavorable
terms. We may also be obliged to indemnify our customers or channel partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses
or modify our products, which could further exhaust our resources. Patent infringement, trademark infringement, trade secret misappropriation
and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could harm our brand, business,
results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against
us or any adverse settlement could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, litigation
can involve significant management time and attention and be expensive, regardless of the outcome. During the course of litigation, there
may be announcements of the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments related to the litigation. If securities analysts
or investors regard these announcements as negative, the trading price of our common stock may decline.
We
may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.
If
we attempt enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be subject or party to claims, negotiations or complex,
protracted litigation. These claims and any resulting lawsuits, if resolved adversely to us, could subject us to significant liability
for damages, impose temporary or permanent injunctions against our solutions or business operations, or invalidate or render unenforceable
our intellectual property
Intellectual
property disputes and litigation, regardless of merit, can be costly and disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention
and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Such litigation, regardless of
its success, could seriously harm our reputation with our channel partners, business partners and patients and in the industry at large.
Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent or intellectual property litigation more effectively than
we can because they have substantially greater resources. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating results.
Risks
Relating to Our Israel Operations
Our
company is headquartered in Israel and, therefore, our results may be adversely affected by economic restrictions imposed on, and political
and current military events.
The
Company’s entire executive leadership, strategic management, and core operations are based in Israel, operating through its wholly
owned subsidiary CTGL Citrine Global Israel Ltd. and its majority-owned subsidiary Cannovation Center Israel Ltd.
On
October 7, 2023, a large-scale war broke out in Israel, resulting in a sustained period of national crisis. The war caused widespread
uncertainty and instability in the country, disrupted the Israeli economy, and affected the Company’s operations The ongoing war
in Israel, which began in October 2023, has created a complex and volatile geopolitical and security environment. This conflict involving
sustained hostilities in multiple regions, including the southern and northern borders poses several risks to the Company’s current
and planned operations in Israel, including:
●
Operational Disruption: Armed conflict and heightened security measures may disrupt infrastructure, workforce availability, and supply
chains, particularly in areas where the Company’s facilities or partners operate.
●
Construction and Project Delays: The Company is in the process of establishing an advanced manufacturing and innovation center in southern
Israel. Ongoing hostilities and regional instability may result in delays in construction timelines, regulatory approvals, and deployment
of key resources.
●
Insurance, Costs, and Logistics: Heightened risk may result in increased insurance premiums, higher costs for security and logistics,
and limited access to certain suppliers or service providers operating in affected regions.
●
Physical Security and Force Majeure: Prolonged conflict increases the risk of damage to physical assets or interruptions to normal operations
due to force majeure events, including missile attacks or military activity in proximity to the Company’s facilities.
Despite
these risks, the Company maintains contingency plans, maintains close coordination with governmental authorities, and is strategically
aligned with national defense priorities — factors which are expected to mitigate long-term adverse effects.
Risks
Related Ownership of Our Securities
A
certain group of the Company’s stockholders may exert significant influence over its affairs, including the outcome of matters
requiring stockholder approval.
Currently,
a certain group of stockholders, including our Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, Ora Elharar Soffer (directly and through Beezhome Technologies Ltd and Citrine S A L Investment & Holdings Ltd) and others, collectively own a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company. As a result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of the Company’s
directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of the Company, (ii) a
sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (iii) amendments to its certificate of incorporation. This concentration of voting
power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to
the Company’s other stockholders and be disadvantageous to the Company’s stockholders with interests different from those
individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over the Company’s business, policies and affairs as officers
or directors of the Company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over the Company.
17
As of the date of this filing, our executive officers and
directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 35.3% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this filing. As
a result, these people, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant
corporate transactions.
You
may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.
Our
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of a maximum 1,500,000 shares of common stock. Any additional financing
effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage
of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. In addition, we have reserved 180,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of such additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into common stock, may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, if all or a substantial portion of these shares
are resold into the public markets then the trading price of our common stock may decline.
If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price
and trading volume could decline.
We
currently do not have and may never obtain research coverage from securities analysts. If no securities analysts commence coverage of our
company, or if industry analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be materially and adversely impacted.
In the event we obtain securities analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate
or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may be materially and adversely impacted. If one or more of these analysts
cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our
stock price and trading volume to decline.
If
the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.
Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC, under the symbol “CTGL,” and, to date, has traded on a limited basis. We have applied
to list our common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol “CTGL.” We cannot assure you that an active public market will continue
for our common stock. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common
stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock, the market price
for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would
be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may
be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment
in us. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could
fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including, but not limited to:
●
our
quarterly or annual operating results;
●
changes
in our earnings estimates or failure to accurately forecast and appropriately plan our expenses;
●
failure
to achieve our growth expectations;
●
failure
to attract new customers or retain existing customers;
●
the
effect of increased or variable competition on our business;
●
additions
or departures of key or qualified personnel;
●
failure
to adequately protect our intellectual property;
●
costs
associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims and related judgments or settlements;
●
changes
in governmental or other regulations affecting our business;
●
our
compliance with governmental or other regulations affecting our business; and
●
changes
in global or regional industry, general market, or economic conditions.
The
stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices
of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes may not be possible to predict and often appear
to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have
little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.
Delaware
law contains provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company, prevent attempts to replace or remove
current management and reduce the market price of its common stock.
Provisions
in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving the
Company that its stockholders may consider favorable. For example, the Company is subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” the
Company may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval, which could
discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. An “interested
stockholder” is, generally, a stockholder who owns 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock or an affiliate
of the Company who has owned 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain
exceptions as described in the DGCL.
18
We
do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock nor are we under any obligation to declare or pay such cash dividends.
We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and the development and growth of our business, and we do not
expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be
limited by any future debt instruments or preferred securities. As a result, investors may only receive a return on their investment
in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases to a price above the price paid for them and then sell such shares.

Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
We
have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our risk management activities
are overseen by senior management and are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management framework. As part of this process,
management identifies and assesses internal and external cybersecurity risks and the potential impact of such risks on our business.
We
utilize external information technology consultants to provide technical support for our systems and to advise on security matters. Risks
associated with third-party service providers who have access to our data are evaluated during the vendor selection process.
To
date, we have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations,
or financial condition. However, we face a variety of cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect our company
in the future, which are further described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Cybersecurity
Governance
1.
Board of Directors’ Oversight
Our
Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. As the Company does not have a separately constituted
audit committee, the entire Board of Directors fulfills this function. The Board receives reports from management on an as-needed basis
regarding information technology and security matters, allowing it to monitor the Company’s risk management processes.
2.
Management’s Role
Our
senior management is responsible for the day-to-day assessment and management of our cybersecurity risks. This function is led by our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who have overall responsibility for the Company’s risk management.
While
our executive officers are not cybersecurity experts, they have extensive experience in business management and corporate governance.
For specific technical expertise, management leverages and consults with our external information technology consultants to advise on
threat identification, prevention, and other cybersecurity matters. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, management would be responsible
for implementing response procedures and reporting the matter to the Board of Directors.

On
January 12, 2023, the Company issued 9,259,250 shares of its common stock to acquire a 10% equity stake in MyPlant Bio Ltd., based on
a $4.45 million valuation. The Company held options to acquire up to an additional 45% of MyPlant’s equity, which were extended
on September 28, 2023 to expire on December 31, 2023. The consideration for these options was to be paid in Company shares and/or cash,
subject to adjustments based on third-party valuation. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not exercise the options, and they expired
unexercised.
On
November 19, 2023, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent (the “Agreement”) with iBOT Israel Botanicals
Ltd. (“iBOT”) pursuant to which the Company will receive an 19% equity stake in iBOT on a fully diluted basis in
consideration for which the Company will issue to iBOT 70,370,370 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Agreement also
granted the Company an option for an additional six months, exercisable through June 30, 2024 to increase the Company’s shareholdings in iBOT to a total of 51% of iBOT’s equity on a fully diluted basis.
The consideration for the increased equity position would be paid by a combination of shares and cash, as agreed by the Company and
iBOT, provided that such consideration shall include a cash component that will be sufficient to cover iBOT’s operating budget
for a 24 month period. iBOT is authorized to determine whether the Company’s exercise of the option, if any, will be through
the issuance by iBOT of new shares to the Company or through the purchase by the Company of the requisite number of shares from
existing iBOT shareholders.
It
was determined that the purchase price for the iBOT equity was based on the discounted pre-company valuation of iBOT prepared by an independent
third party valuator commissioned by the Company of $10,000,000. It was also agreed that all share issuances by the Company to iBOT would
be calculated a per share price of $0.027, representing then the highest closing price of the Company’s common stock during the
30-day period preceding the authorization of the Company’s board of directors of the transaction.
On
December 31, 2023, the Company executed and consummated a Share Purchase and Option Agreement with iBOT and its shareholders. Under
the agreement, Citrine Global will issue 70,370,370 shares of common stock in exchange for a 19% fully diluted equity interest in
iBOT.

agreement included an option exercisable through June 30, 2024, to increase the Company’s stake to 51%, subject to additional consideration
in the form of shares and cash to cover iBOT’s pre-approved 24-month operating budget. The agreement also contained a no-shop clause
and standard representations, warranties, and indemnification provisions.
In

has since expired, leaving the Company with its current 19% holding in iBOT.

from the due date until the same is paid. As of December 31, 2024, the Company repaid the entire outstanding amounts on the note.
On
February 22, 2024, Mr. Doron Birger resigned from his position as a director on the Board of the Company.
On
August 2, 2024, the Company and X Group Fund of Funds Limited Partnership formed under the laws of Michigan (“X Group”) entered
into a term sheet agreement-in-principle pursuant to which the X Group agreed to purchase, and Citrine Global agreed to sell, units of
Citrine Global’s securities where each unit (each a “Unit”) is comprised of (i) one (1) share of common stock and (ii)
a warrant, exercisable through the earlier of December 31, 2024 or such time as Citrine Global is cleared for listing on a U.S. National
exchange, to purchase an additional one share of common stock at a per share exercise price of $0.01. The purchase price per Unit is

As the X Group did not remit the agreed amount within the approved timeframes, the agreement lapsed.
On
September 15, 2024, Mr. Ilan Ben Ishay resigned from his position as a director on the Board of subsidiary CTGL Citrine Global Israel
Ltd. On October 1, 2024, Mr. Ilan Ben Ishay resigned from his position as a director on the Board of subsidiary Cannovation Center Israel
Ltd.
On
November 2024, the Company’s subsidiary, Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. (“Cannovation”), filed a debt claim in the
insolvency proceedings of Golden Holdings Neto Ltd. (“Golden Holdings”). At the relevant time, Golden Holdings held approximately
20% of Cannovation’s shares.
Pursuant
to agreements between the parties and as a shareholder, Golden Holdings had committed to support Cannovation, including by signing guarantees
on behalf of the company and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Ilan Ben Ishay, and by providing financial assistance. Upon Golden Holdings
entering insolvency proceedings, such support ceased. Accordingly, Cannovation filed an official debt claim with the trustee of Golden
Holdings in the amount of NIS 1,512,983 (approximately USD 420,000), for amounts it claims are due to it under prior agreements and commitments.
The claim was submitted as part of the proceedings before the Haifa District Court and is currently under review by the relevant authorities.
During a meeting of Cannovation’s board of directors, it was explained that additional shareholder support was required, including
signing guarantees for a loan from S.R. Accord as well as a guaranteed letter for a deposit related to a government grant received by
Cannovation for the SkyTech project, in addition to other company commitments. The board resolved to request that all Cannovation shareholders
support the company, including by signing corporate and personal guarantees. To that end, a mechanism was established whereby shareholders
who provided such support, including signing personal guarantees, would be entitled to receive additional share allocations, whereas
shareholders who did not provide such support would not receive any new share allocations. In January 2025, during a shareholders’
meeting, Cannovation addressed all shareholders, including Golden Holdings, requesting such support and the signing of personal guarantees.
As Golden Holdings did not provide such commitments, new shares were allocated to the existing shareholders CTGL Citrine Global Israel
Ltd., a subsidiary of Citrine Global Corp., and Beezhome Technologies Ltd., resulting in Golden Holdings’ ownership in Cannovation
being reduced to approximately 1%.
On
September 1, 2024, Lior Asher and or Deer Light Ltd entered into consulting agreements with the Company and its subsidiaries. On September

all payments under these agreements are deferred until the earlier of: (i) the listing of Citrine Global Corp on a recognized U.S. stock
exchange; (ii) successful fundraising of at least USD2.5 million from external sources; or (iii) the Company achieving positive operational
cash flow, confirmed by the board of directors (“Payment Event”).In addition to cash compensation, the Company may award
equity-based compensation under future equity incentive plans, subject to board approval. One such equity grant will approve by company,
granting options to purchase 41,762,976 common shares, with a two-year vesting schedule and 50% acceleration upon uplisting. As of this
report, the options have not been issued yet.

the Company, its Israeli subsidiary CTGL – Citrine Global Israel Ltd., and Beezhome Technologies Ltd., a private company wholly
owned by Ms. Ora Elharar Soffer, signed the agreement. While Netto Holdings Ltd. and Mr. Ilan Ben Ishay had originally undertaken to
provide personal guarantees, they had not executed such guarantees as of that date. All collateral under the Credit Facility remained
in place, including a first-priority lien over the Company’s rights and the 125,000 sq. ft. (11,687 sq. meters) industrial parcel
in Yerucham, Israel, as well as additional collateral intended to secure repayment of the loan and to cover any damage, debt, or obligation
arising from the Credit Facility. The Company, together with CTGL – Citrine Global Israel Ltd. and Cannovation Center Israel Ltd.
(now SkyTech Orion Ltd.), undertook to fully indemnify both Ms. Elharar Soffer and Mr. Lior Asher for any liability, damage, or loss
that may result from their personal guarantees. On March 31, 2025, the total amount of the Credit Facility was increased to NIS 1,000,000

Components

following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial
statements.
Revenues
We
have not generated any revenues from product sales as of December 31, 2023.
Research
and Development Expenses
The
process of researching and developing our products is lengthy, unpredictable, and subject to many risks. We expect to continue incurring
expenses for the next several years for research and development as we continue to develop products and innovative solutions. We are
unable, with any certainty, to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those expenses will be incurred. Our current development
plans focus on the development of plant-based solutions including.
Our
research and development costs include costs are composed of:
●
internal recurring costs, such as personnel-related and consultants costs (salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other
costs), materials and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs attributable to research and development functions; and
●
fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as preclinical testing, manufacturing and related testing and
activities.
Marketing
Marketing
expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other personnel-related costs associated with executive
and other support staff. Other significant marketing expenses include the costs associated with professional fees to develop our marketing
strategy.
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other personnel-related costs
associated with executive, administrative and other support staff. Other significant general and administrative expenses include the
costs associated with professional fees for accounting, auditing, insurance costs, consulting and legal services, along with facility
and maintenance costs attributable to general and administrative functions.
Financial

expenses consist primarily of the impact of exchange rate derived from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar
currencies. Other financial expenses include bank fees and interest on long term loans.

Our
research and development (R&D) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $96,000, a slight decrease from $120,000 in the
prior year. These expenses consist primarily of fees for compensation to officers involved in R&D activities.
Our
marketing, general and administrative (G&A) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $2,202,000, an increase from $1,866,000
in 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to non-cash share-based compensation expenses related to consulting and investor relations
services, as well as costs associated with amendments to executive consulting agreements made in March 2023.
Our
financing expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $807,000, compared to $659,000 in 2022. The increase was primarily
due to a non-cash expense of $291,000 recognized upon the expiration of the Company’s option to acquire additional shares in MyPlant
Bio Ltd., which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to convertible loan terms.
As
a result of the foregoing, our net loss increased to $3,105,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, from a net loss of $2,645,000 in
2022.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of $7,000 and a working capital deficiency of $2,461,000. This compares to a cash balance
of $77,000 and a working capital deficiency of $1,620,000 as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in our working capital was primarily
due to an increase in accrued compensation and other liabilities.
Net
cash used in operating activities was $199,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $567,000 in the prior year. The decrease
in cash used, despite a larger net loss, was primarily due to significant non-cash expenses (such as share-based compensation and the
MyPlant option expense) and an increase in accrued liabilities to related parties.
The
following table provides a summary of operating, investing, and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively:

As of September 2024, the Company
renewed its short term loan with S.R. Accord Ltd. in the amount of approximately NIS 660,000 (approximately $176,000). As part of the
renewal, Mr. Lior Asher signed as a personal guarantor, joining Ms. Ora Elharar Soffer as guarantor. In addition, the Company, its Israeli
subsidiary CTGL – Citrine Global Israel Ltd., and Beezhome Technologies Ltd., a private company wholly owned by Ms. Ora Elharar
Soffer, signed the agreement. While Netto Holdings Ltd. and Mr. Ilan Ben Ishay had originally undertaken to provide personal guarantees,
they had not executed such guarantees as of that date. All collateral under the Credit Facility remained in place, including a first-priority
lien over the Company’s rights and the 125,000 sq. ft. (11,687 sq. meters) industrial parcel in Yerucham, Israel, as well as additional
collateral intended to secure repayment of the loan and to cover any damage, debt, or obligation arising from the Credit Facility. The
Company, together with CTGL – Citrine Global Israel Ltd. and Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. (now SkyTech Orion Ltd.), undertook
to fully indemnify both Ms. Elharar Soffer and Mr. Lior Asher for any liability, damage, or loss that may result from their personal guarantees.
On March 31, 2025, the total amount of the short term loan was increased to NIS 1,000,000 (approximately $280,000), with all guarantees
and collateral remaining in place.
On
August 2025, SR Accord extended the credit facility agreement with Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. (renamed SkyTech Orion Ltd.) until
March 31, 2027. The facility is supported by guarantees of CTGL Citrine Global Israel Ltd. and Citrine Global Corp., as well as personal
guarantees signed by Ora Elharar-Soffer, the Company’s CEO, and Lior Asher, a director of SkyTech Orion Ltd. With respect to the
personal guarantees of Ora Elharar-Soffer and Lior Asher, the companies Cannovation Center Israel Ltd.(renamed SkyTech Orion Ltd.) CTGL
Citrine Global Israel Ltd., and Citrine Global Corp. have confirmed, in line with prior Board resolutions, their undertaking to provide
indemnification and comprehensive protections to the guarantors.
Based
on the Company’s current cash balances and the access to the Credit Facility described above, the Company believes that it has
sufficient funds for its plans for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. As the Company is embarking
on its activities as detailed herein, it is incurring losses. It cannot determine with reasonable certainty when and if it will have
sustainable profits.

Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements are described in the notes to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
and which included within Item 8 in this annual report. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical
to our financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Share-Based
Compensation: We measure and recognize compensation expenses for all stock option grants to employees, directors, and consultants based
on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which
requires management to make significant assumptions regarding volatility, the expected life of the option, and the risk-free interest
rate. These assumptions are based on historical data and management’s judgment, and changes to these assumptions could have a material
impact on the amount of share-based compensation expense recorded.
Investments
Valued Under the Measurement Alternative: Our long-term investments in privately held companies, such as Nanomedic Technologies Ltd.,
MyPlant Bio Ltd., and iBOT Israel Botanicals Ltd., are carried at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes. Due
to the absence of a readily determinable fair value for these investments, we periodically perform a qualitative assessment to identify
any impairment. This assessment requires significant management judgment regarding the financial health and business prospects of these
companies.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Citrine Global Corp
Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citrine Global Corp and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023
and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ deficit, and cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit
matters.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
1 – GENERAL
Citrine
Global, Corp. (“Citrine Global” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
May 26, 2010. The Company’s common stock is traded in the United States on the OTC market under the ticker symbol “CTGL.”
On
June 3, 2020 the Company established a wholly owned new Israeli subsidiary: CTGL – Citrine Global Israel Ltd, (the “Israeli
Subsidiary”).
On
August 20, 2020, the Israeli Subsidiary, Beezhome Technologies Ltd., a company owned and controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Golden Holdings Neto Ltd., a company in which Ilan Ben-Ishay, a former director of the Company, holds shares, incorporated
Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. (“Cannovation”). Israeli Subsidiary holds 60% of Cannovation’s shares, while each of
Beezhome Technologies Ltd. and Golden Holdings Neto Ltd. holds 20% of its shares.
Financial
support
On
March 6, 2023 Cannovation and S.R. Accord Ltd., an Israeli company (“Lender”), entered into an 18-month credit facility agreement
(the “Credit Facility”) pursuant to which Lender has committed to fund Cannovation in an aggregate amount of NIS 3,000,000
(approximately $857,000), as needed. At the time of each draw down, Cannovation and Lender will determine the maturity date of the loan.
All amounts drawn under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a monthly rate of 1.7%. Cannovation has the right to pre-pay the entire
amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at any time. As security for any loans under the Credit Facility, Cannovation granted the
Lender a first priority lien on its rights to the 125,000 sq ft (11,687 sq meters) of industrial land in Yerucham (see note 4(1) below).
The lien will become effective only if Cannovation utilizes the Credit Facility. If the market value of the Premises is less than the
amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, then Lender will be entitled to additional security including additional shares of Citrine
Global common stock, on such terms and conditions as the parties may agree. As additional security for any payments due to Lender, (i)
Israeli Subsidiary, (ii) Beezhome and (iii) Netto Holdings, an unaffiliated entity under the partial control of Ilan Ben Ishay, a director
on the board of Cannovation, as well as each of Ms. Elharar Soffer and Mr. Ben Ishay in their personal capacities, have provided guarantees
for the repayment of any amounts that may be owing to Lender under the Credit Facility. Cannovation has agreed to indemnify Ms. Elharar
Soffer and Mr. Ben Ishay for any losses they incur as a result of the guarantee.
On
March 7, 2023, the Company issued to the Lender 2,154,677 shares of the Company’s common stock a commitment fee in respect of the
provision of the Credit Facility.
As
of the date of this report, Cannovation utilized NIS1,000,000
( $280,000)
of the credit line.
On
August 2025, SR Accord extended the credit facility agreement with Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. (renamed SkyTech Orion Ltd.) until
March 31, 2027. The facility is supported by guarantees of CTGL Citrine Global Israel Ltd. and Citrine Global Corp., as well as personal
guarantees signed by Ora Elharar-Soffer, the Company’s CEO, and Lior Asher, a director of SkyTech Orion Ltd. With respect to the
personal guarantees of Ora Elharar-Soffer and Lior Asher, the companies Cannovation Center Israel Ltd.(renamed SkyTech Orion Ltd ) CTGL
Citrine Global Israel Ltd., and Citrine Global Corp. have confirmed, in line with prior Board resolutions, their undertaking to provide
indemnification and comprehensive protections to the guarantors. See also Note 5 and 12D below.
The
Company has no significant firm commitments that require it to remit cash and can control the level of expenses it incurs. Based on the
Company’s current cash balances, and the access to the Credit Facility noted above, the Company believes it will have sufficient
funds for its plans for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. As the Company is embarking on its business
plan, it is incurring losses. It cannot determine with reasonable certainty when and if it will have sustainable profits.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Citrine Global and its Israeli Subsidiaries, CTGL - Citrine Global
Israel Ltd and Cannovation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include share-based compensation and fair value
measurements of the convertible notes and MY PLANT and IBOT options. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Functional
Currency and Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions.
The
currency of the primary economic environment in which the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are conducted is the U.S. dollar.
Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of
the transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net loss
for the year.
Cash,
cash equivalents and restricted cash
Cash
equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments which include short term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit),
that are not restricted as to withdrawals or use that are readily convertible to cash with maturities of three months or less as of the
date acquired.
Property,

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. When an asset is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition is reflected in the Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)
Warrant on the company’s shares
When the Company becomes a party to
freestanding convertible instruments, the Company first analyzes the provisions of ASC 480 in order to determine whether the
instrument should be classified as a liability, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in
each period. Warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares are not within the scope of ASC 480, and as such the Company further analyzes the
provisions of ASC 815-40 in order to determine whether the contract should be classified within equity or classified as a
liability, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in each period.
Under ASC 815-40, contracts that are
not indexed to the Company’s own stock are classified as liabilities recorded at fair value, The Company applies similar
guidance to embedded conversion options that meet the definition of a derivative per ASC 815.
The Company reassesses the classification of a contract over
its own equity under the guidance above at each balance sheet date. If classification changes as a result of events during the reporting
period, the Company reclassifies the contract as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. When a contract over own equity
is reclassified from a liability to equity, gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that
the contract was classified as a liability are not reversed, and the contract is marked to fair value immediately before the reclassification.
Investments
valued under the measurement alternative
The
Company’s investments as described in Note 3 include equity securities in other companies for which the Company does not have significant
influence or control, and fair value is not readily determinable. Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 requires equity
securities to be recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period. However, the guidance allows for a measurement
alternative, which is to record investments at cost, less impairment, if any, and subsequently adjust for observable price changes of
identical or similar investments of the same issuer.
Due
to the lack of readily determinable fair values for such investments, the Company accounts for these investments under the measurement
alternative at cost, less impairment.
The
Company periodically performs qualitative impairment assessments on its investments recorded under the measurement alternative.
Impairment
of long-lived assets
The
Group’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment”,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets
to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. No indicators of impairment have been identified as of December 31, 2023,
and 2022.
Derivatives
Derivative
instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of financial
expenses, net in the statements of operation.
Once
determined, derivative liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.
Income
taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”. Accordingly, deferred taxes assets and
liabilities are determined utilizing the asset and liability method based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between
the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under the applicable tax law. Deferred tax balances
are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances in respect of
deferred tax assets are provided for, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized.
The
Company accounts for uncertainty in income tax in accordance with ASC Topic 740, which prescribes detailed guidance for the financial
statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of tax positions. According to ASC Topic 740, tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold. Recognized tax positions are measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized.
The Company’s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties relating to income taxes under income taxes; however the
Company did not recognize such items in its fiscal 2023 and 2022 financial statements and did not record any unrecognized tax benefits.

Basic
and diluted loss per ordinary share
Basic
loss per share of Common Stock is computed by dividing the loss for the period applicable to holders of shares of Common Stock, by the
weighed average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.
In
computing diluted loss per share, basic loss per share is adjusted to reflect the potential dilution that could occur upon the exercise
of potential shares. Accordingly, in periods of net loss, no potential shares are considered due to their anti-dilutive effect on loss
per share.
Stock-based
compensation
The
Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all equity-based payments based on their estimated fair values in accordance
with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation”. Share-based payments including grants of stock options are recognized in
the statement of operation as an operating expense based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. The fair value of stock
options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has expensed compensation costs, applying the
accelerated vesting method, over the requisite service period or over the implicit service period.
The company’s accounting policy is to recognize forfeitures when they occur.
Fair
value
Fair
value of certain of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
convertible notes and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports
fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,”
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair
value, as defined by ASC 820, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants,
principal (or most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect
the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company’s credit risk.
Valuation
techniques are generally classified into three categories: (i) the market approach; (ii) the income approach; and (iii) the cost approach.
The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the
characteristics of the asset or liability, and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides fair value
hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:
Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
F-11
CITRINE
GLOBAL CORP.
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)
Level
2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant to the
fair values.
Fair
value measurements are required to be disclosed by the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in
their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded
disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period
attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), (ii) segregating those gains or losses
included in earnings, and (iii) a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of operations.

Concentrations
of credit risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents as well
as certain other current assets that do not amount to a significant amount. Cash and cash equivalents, which are primarily held in Dollars
and New Israeli Shekels, are deposited with major banks in Israel and United States. Management believes that such financial institutions
are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial instruments. The Company does not
have any significant off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign
hedging arrangements.
Contingencies
The
Company records accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation and other sources when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional
information becomes available. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
Loan
Issuance costs
As
mentioned in Note 5, the Company has received a credit line from a lender. The Company has issued to the lender and a consultant shares
of the Company’s common stock as a commitment fee in respect of the provision of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee is recognized
as a prepaid expense. Upon each utilization of the credit line, the Company recognizes a proportionate part of the commitment fee and
records that part as financial expenses.
Accounting
Standards Not Yet Adopted
Segment
Reporting: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
requires incremental disclosures related to an entity’s reportable segments, including (i) significant segment expense categories
and amounts for each reportable segment that are provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), (ii) an aggregate
amount and description of other segment items included in each reported measure, (iii) all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s
profit or loss and assets required by Topic 280 to be disclosed in interim periods, (iv) the title and position of the individual or
the name of the group identified as the CODM and (v) an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss
to assess performance and allocate resources to the segment. The standard improves transparency by providing disaggregated expense information
about an entity’s reportable segments. The standard does not change the definition of a segment, the method for determining segments
or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the ASU and it
did not have a material impact on its financial statement.
Income
Taxes: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments
in this ASU add specific requirements for income tax disclosures to improve transparency and decision usefulness. The guidance in ASU
2023-09 requires that public business entities disclose specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional
qualitative information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2023-09 require
that all entities disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and disaggregated by individual
jurisdictions. The ASU also includes other disclosure amendments related to the disaggregation of income tax expense between federal,
state and foreign taxes. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.
The amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis and retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company’s disclosures.

period an entity will, inter alia, disclose amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and amortization included
in each relevant expense caption (such as cost of sales, SG&A and research and development). Amounts remaining in relevant expense
captions that are not separately disclosed will be described qualitatively. Certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed
under currently effective U.S GAAP will be included in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements. The amendments also

On
June 22, 2020, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Nanomedic Technologies Ltd., an Israeli private company and
a related party as further described below (“Nanomedic”) as part of an A-1 funding round open only to existing Nanomedic
shareholders and their affiliates. Nanomedic developed SpinCare™, a system that integrates electrospinning technology into a
portable, bedside device, offering immediate wound and burn care treatment. The Company paid $450 thousand for A-1 preferred shares
of Nanomedic and also received warrants to purchase A-1 preferred shares. Such investment represents a holding of approximately 3.3%
in Nanomedic. The round raised approximately $2.2 million in total.
The Company accounts for the investment in Nanomedic in accordance with the provisions of ASC 321, “Investments - Equity
Securities”, and elected to use the measurement alternative therein. The investment will be re-measured upon future observable
price change(s) in orderly transaction(s) or upon impairment, if any. No such observable price changes have occurred during 2023 and
2022. See note 12M below.

On
December 30, 2022, the Company, MyPlant Bio Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of Israel (“MyPlant”), Cannasoul
Analytics Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of Israel (“Cannasoul”), and PurPlant Inc., a company duly incorporated
under the laws of Canada (“PurPlant”) (Cannasoul and PurPlant are collectively referred to as the “Shareholders”),
and Professor Dedi Meiri, an Israeli individual (“Prof Meiri”) entered into the Share Purchase and Option Agreement (the
“Share Purchase and Option Agreement”) for the purchase by the Company of up to 55% of MyPlant’s issued and outstanding
share capital on a fully diluted basis
The
Company purchased from the Shareholders an aggregate of 15,211 ordinary shares of MyPlant (the “MyPlant
Shares”) representing, on a fully diluted basis, 10% of the outstanding MyPlant Shares, in consideration
for the payment of $444,444 by the issuance by the Company to the selling Shareholders of an aggregate
of 9,259,250 shares of the Company’s common stock. On January 12, 2023 the company issued the shares
above.
In
addition, under the Share Purchase and Option Agreement, the Company was granted an option by the MyPlant
shareholders to purchase an additional 35% of MyPlant Shares, on a fully diluted basis (the “Shareholders
Option”), in consideration of $1,555,556 payable by the issuance of up to 32,407,417 shares of the
Company’s common stock to the MyPlant shareholders, and a separate option by MyPlant to purchase an additional
10% of the MyPlant Shares, on a fully diluted basis (the “MyPlant Option”), in consideration of $444,444,
which is payable, in the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or in the issuance to MyPlant of up to 9,259,250
shares of our common stock.
Said
options are exercisable through September 30, 2023 (the “Option Expiry Date”). If both the shareholders Option and the
Company Options are exercised, the Company will hold 55% of MyPlant Shares, on a fully diluted basis. Under the Share Purchase and
Option Agreement, the Company is authorized to continue its due diligence through the Option Expiry Date. The number of shares is
subject to adjustment in respect of any stock split or other recapitalization of the Company.
The
transactions under the Share Purchase and Option Agreement are based on a MyPlant company valuation of approximately $4.45 million.
The Company is authorized at any time on or before the Option Expiry Date to obtain an independent third-party valuation of MyPlant.
If it is determined by such third party valuation that MyPlant’s valuation is less than $4.45 million, the consideration payable
in respect of the exercise price of the options will be accordingly adjusted, provided however that in any case MyPlant’s valuation
in the transaction shall not be below US$1,000,000.
On
September 28, 2023, the Company and MyPlant entered into an amendment of the Share Purchase and Option Agreement to extend to December
31, 2023 the Option Expiry Date available to the Company to purchase an additional 45% of MyPlant’s share equity, on a fully
diluted basis. All other terms and conditions of the Share Purchase and Option Agreement remain in full force and effect. The Option
expired on December 31, 2023, unexercised.
The
options to purchase MyPlant shares were also accounted using the measurement alternative. Since the options’ value are subject
to the changes in Citrine shares’ value, there are indicators to a change in the options’ value at each reporting date,
and therefore the following valuation method was implemented.

November 2, 2023, the Board of Directors the
Company determined to seek an agreement with iBOT Israel Botanicals Ltd. (“iBOT”) pursuant to which the Company, would
purchase, on an initial basis, a 19% equity stake in iBOT with an option to increase the Company’s equity holdings to 51% (the “Shareholders option”), on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Company and iBOT. It was determined that the offered purchase price would be based on the
discounted pre-company valuation of iBOT prepared by an independent third-party valuator commissioned by the Company of $10,000,000.
It was also determined by the Board that consideration for the initial 19% equity stake would be by way of a share exchange with
iBOT and the balance of the consideration would be by way of combination of shares and cash as agreed to by the Company and iBOT. It
was also agreed that all Company share issuance to iBOT would be calculated a per share price of $0.027, representing then the
highest closing price of the Company’s common stock during the preceding 30 day period.
As

July 13, 2021, the Ministry of Economy of the Israeli government recommended to the Israel Land Authority (“ILA”) that it
approve a grant of 11,687 square meters of industrial parcel of land in Yerucham, Israel (the “Land”) for Cannovation to build
the Cannovation Center, at a subsidized price and exempt from a tender procedures typically required under Israeli law, to include factories,
laboratories, logistics and a distribution center for the medical botanicals industries. As noted, Citrine Global owns
60%  of the share capital of Cannovation, through the Israeli Subsidiary. Cannovation is in process of receiving the required building
permits and approvals to start the construction and is in process with several financing entities in the area of real-estate financing.
During
December 2021, Cannovation remitted to the Israeli Ministry of the Economy and the ILA the aggregate amount of NIS 688 thousand ($196
thousand on the date of payment) to obtain the rights to the Land. The discounted amount paid is part of the grant by the Israeli government
under government programs to encourage industrial development in Southern Israel. The amount remitted represents the sum total amount
that Cannovation is required to pay as the purchase price for the Land.
Under
the Agreement, Cannovation committed to build and develop an Operational Production and Innovation Center in accordance with the time frames, terms and conditions
of the Agreement. Typically, the initial time frame for completing the development is four (4) years, subject to extensions that the
ILA may approve. Upon completion of the development within the time frames and other requirements specified in the Agreement, Cannovation
will be entitled, subject to Israeli law, to long term lease agreement (49 years) to the Land (equivalent to ownership rights as most
of the land in Israel is government owned and when marketed usually the developers are granted with development/long lease rights).
The
Company has also capitalized $24 thousand of related expenses as land costs.
On
February 8, 2022, Cannovation received from the ILA a counter-signed development agreement to purchase rights for long term lease to
11,687 square meters of Land for purposes of building the Operational Production and Innovation Center l, which is intended to
include factories, laboratories, logistics and a distribution center for the botanicals industries.

All amounts drawn under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a monthly rate of 1.7%. Cannovation has the right to pre-pay the entire
amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at any time. As security for any loans under the Credit Facility, Cannovation granted the
Lender a first priority lien on its rights to the 125,000 sq ft (11,687 sq meters) of industrial land in Yerucham (“the Premises”).
The lien will become effective only if Cannovation utilizes the Credit Facility. If the market value of the Premises is less than the
amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, then Lender will be entitled to additional security including additional shares of Citrine
Global common stock, on such terms and conditions as the parties may agree. As additional security for any payments due to Lender, (i)
the Israeli Subsidiary, (ii) Beezhome and (iii) Netto Holdings, an unaffiliated entity under the partial control of Ilan Ben Ishay,
a director on the board of Cannovation, as well as each of Ms. Elharar Soffer and Mr. Ben Ishay have, in their personal capacities, provided
guarantees for the repayment of any amounts that may be owing to Lender under the Credit Facility. The Company, CTGL – Citrine
Global Israel Ltd. and Cannovation have agreed to indemnify Ms. Elharar Soffer and Mr. Ben Ishay for any losses they incur as a result
of the personal guarantees.
On
March 7, 2023, the Company issued to the Lender and a consultant 3,232,016 shares of the Company’s common stock as a commitment
fee in respect of the provision of the Credit Facility (valuated at $123 thousand). As of December 2023, Cannovation utilized NIS660,000
( $182,000) of the credit line.

January 5, 2022, the Company and the related entities who are the signatory lenders (hereinafter
the “Buyers”) under the Convertible Loan Agreement dated as of April 1, 2020
(the “CL Agreement”) with the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the
CL Agreement pursuant to which the following was agreed to:
(i)The
principal and accrued interest on all outstanding loans in the aggregate principal amount
of $1,800,000 are to be repaid in New Israeli Shekels (NIS) at the conversion rate in effect
on the date on which the loan was advanced;
(ii)The
conversion price on all outstanding notes under the CL Agreement was adjusted to a conversion
price of $0.05 per share
(iii)The
exercise price on all outstanding warrants issued in connection with advances made under
the CL Agreement was adjusted to an exercise price of $0.05 per share.
The
Company concluded that the change in terms does not give rise to a troubled debt restructuring, as no concession was given to the Company.
Therefore,
the Company went on to assess whether the terms of the modified note are substantially different. The Company concluded that the
change in terms should be accounted for as a debt extinguishment.
In
accordance with ASC 815-15-35-4, since the embedded conversion option in the convertible debt meets the bifurcation criteria, the fair
value of the conversion component calculated as of January 5, 2022, in the amount of $162 thousand, was reclassified from shareholders

interest) such that such terms shall be adjusted on a pro-rata basis, to those terms applicable to the Company’s convertible
notes then outstanding under the Convertible Note Agreement (as detailed in note 6 A above).

where the Series A and B warrants are exercisable through August 9, 2027, at an exercise price of $0.05 per share.
The
Company concluded that the change in term does not constitute a troubled debt restructuring. Thereafter, the Company applied the guidance

In
accordance with ASC 815-15-25 the conversion feature was considered a liability classified embedded derivative instrument and is to
be recorded at its fair value separately from the convertible notes, within non-current liabilities in the Company’s balance sheet.
The conversion component is then remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with the resulting gains or losses shown in the statements

The
fair value of the convertible component was estimated by third party appraiser as weighted average of the two possible scenarios of the
total convertible notes amount conversion (20% probability for scenario 1 and 80% probability for scenario 2):
The
scenario in which the convertible loan would be converted prior to its maturity (scenario 1) was estimated by the appraiser using the

(the “Agreement”) pursuant to which they have agreed to extend the maturity date
on all outstanding convertible loans in the principal amount of $1,800,000 under the CL Agreement
to May 31, 2024.
In
addition, under the Agreement the Company and the Lending LPs have also agreed that if the Company’s common stock is listed on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, then the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine to convert, in whole or in part, the outstanding amount
of the above mentioned notes to shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the price paid by the public
investors for the common stock in the offering accompanying the listing.
The
Company concluded that the above-mentioned change in terms constitutes a troubled debt restructuring, due to its financial condition
and the concession that the above mentioned changes provided.
Therefore,
the Company concluded that the change in terms should be accounted for as a modification. A new effective interest rate was established
based on the carrying value of the debt and the revised cash flows.

price of the offering accompanying such listing is less than the then current exercise price of the Warrants, then the Warrant exercise

“Land”) to build the Cannovation Center, at a subsidized price and exempt from a tender procedure typically required under
Israeli law, to include factories, laboratories, logistics and a distribution center for the botanicals industries.
On
January 12, 2025, Cannovation Center Israel Ltd. the Israeli subsidiary received official notification from the Israeli Ministry of
Economy and Industry that it had been awarded a government grant in the amount of NIS 12.5
million (approximately USD 3.4
million). The grant, in the amount of NIS 12.5 million (approximately USD 3.4 million), is structured as reimbursements of

connection with the establishment of the SkyTech Innovation and Production Center. The grant was awarded as part of a national strategic program supporting the defense
sector. The funds are designated for the establishment of the SkyTech Innovation and Production Center in the city of Yerucham,
Israel, on land that had previously been allocated to the subsidiary by the State of Israel as part of a prior grant for the
construction of an Operational Innovation Center. This
new grant is in addition to the prior allocation and supports the construction of approximately 5,000 square meters of facilities on
the 11.7 dunam (about 2.89 acres) plot. The Center will include assembly lines, R&D laboratories, testing facilities, and an
advanced production system focused on developing and manufacturing defense-grade UAV and drone solutions.

per share, and an equal number of warrants to purchase common stock were issued under the same terms. The warrants are exercisable
by December 31, 2025, or upon uplisting to a national stock exchange, whichever comes first. Further to Note 6K above, the

subsidiary of Citrine Global Corp.), Beezhome Technologies Ltd. (owned by Ms. Ora Elharar Soffer, the Company’s CEO), holding 20%,
and Golden Holdings Finance, holding 20%. All shareholders were given the opportunity to support the Company, including by providing personal
guarantees for existing loans as well as for obligations under the government grant. CTGL Citrine Global Israel Ltd. expressed its support,
and Beezhome Technologies Ltd., through its owner and the Company’s CEO, Ms. Ora Elharar Soffer, personally signed guarantees in
connection with the existing loans and the government grant commitments, thereby providing the direct backing required to advance the
Company’s activities.
On May 29, 2025, after the period
granted to Golden Holdings Finance had passed, and since it did not provide any support or personal guarantees, the Company executed the
resolution. Pursuant to this resolution, new shares were allocated to CTGL Citrine Global Israel Ltd., increasing its holdings to 69.5%,
and to Beezhome Technologies Ltd., increasing its holdings to 29.5%. As a result, the holdings of Golden Holdings Finance in Cannovation
were diluted to approximately 1%.

Bank Mizrahi. The guarantee is backed by an unlimited personal guarantee from Ms. Ora Elharar Soffer and a limited personal guarantee
from Mr. Meir Aharon, who, through his consulting and construction company, has been engaged to build the SkyTech Center in Yerucham.

round of approximately 3 million. Based on this financing round the Company recorded an impairment loss of approximately $431,000 during
the period. Following the impairment, the carrying amount of the investment as of June, 30, 2025 is approximately $18,000.
N.

shares was restricted, and there is currently no active market for the Company’s securities. Due to the lack of an active market,
the Company determined that the shares underlying the conversion option in its notes are no longer readily convertible to cash. Therefore,
the embedded conversion features no longer meets the definition of a derivative per ASC 815 and were classified as equity

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and chairperson
of the Board, and the Company’s principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company’s management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and the Company’s management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.
Based
on the Company’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer , to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting. In order to evaluate
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company’s
management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer conducted an assessment,
using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tredway Commission
(“COSO”) (2013). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness
of controls, and a conclusion on this evaluation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Based
on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2023 as it identified no control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is not a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
