All other marks mentioned herein are the property of their respective holders.We are a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas such as nanoscale manufacturing enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering, and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, cloud and enterprise servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices. Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) that make products such as non-volatile memory (“NVM”), dynamic random-access memory (“DRAM”), and logic devices. Their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits (“ICs”) on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires a sequence of highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from cloud computing (the “Cloud”), artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things (“IoT”), and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional (“3D”) architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition, etch, and clean markets to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners, including our close-to-customer focus; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.We also address processes for back-end wafer-level packaging (“WLP”), which is an alternative to traditional wire bonding and can offer a smaller form factor, increased interconnect speed and bandwidth, and lower power consumption, among other benefits. We offer advanced packaging solutions that support fan-out panel-level packaging, a process in which chips or chiplets are cut from a large format substrate sheet several times the size of a traditional silicon wafer, which increases yield and reduces waste and solutions that meet the need for 3D stacking of high bandwidth memory (“HBM”). In addition, our products are well-suited for related markets that rely on semiconductor processes and require production-proven manufacturing capability, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensors (“CIS”) and micro-electromechanical systems (“MEMS”).Our Customer Support Business Group (“CSBG”) provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency. We offer a broad range of services to deliver value throughout the lifecycle of our equipment, including customer service, spares, upgrades, and new and refurbished non-leading edge products in our deposition, etch, and clean markets. Many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest products are also available as upgrades, which provide customers with a cost-effective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of their existing wafer fabrication lines. Service offerings include fleet level Equipment Intelligence® solutions to maximize the productivity of our customers through system uptime or availability optimization, throughput improvements, and defect reduction. Our spares product line offers running cost optimization programs and focuses on product life extension to help customers increase the return on their capital purchases. Additionally, within CSBG, our Reliant® product line offers new and refurbished non-leading edge products in deposition, etch and clean markets for those applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability.

Depending on the type of material and structure being made, different techniques are employed. Electrochemical deposition creates the copper wiring (interconnect) that links devices in an integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”). Plating of copper and other metals is also used for TSV and WLP applications. Tiny molybdenum or tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time. Plasma-enhanced CVD, high-density plasma CVD, and ALD are used to form the critical insulating layers that isolate and protect all of these electrical structures. Lastly, post-deposition treatments such as ultraviolet thermal processing are used to improve dielectric film properties.ALTUS® Product FamilyTungsten and/or molybdenum deposition is used to form conductive features such as contacts, vias, and wordlines on a chip. These features are small, often narrow, and use only a small amount of metal, so minimizing resistance and achieving complete fill can be difficult. At these nanoscale dimensions, even slight imperfections can impact device performance or cause a chip to fail. Our ALTUS® systems combine CVD and ALD technologies to deposit the highly conformal or selective films as needed for advanced tungsten or molybdenum metallization (ALTUS® Halo) applications in both logic and memory. The Multi-Station Sequential Deposition architecture enables nucleation layer formation and bulk CVD/ALD fill to be performed in the same chamber (“in situ”). Our ALD technologies are used in the deposition of barrier films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness at lower temperatures relative to a conventional process.SABRE® Product FamilyCopper deposition lays down the electrical wiring for most semiconductor devices. Even the smallest defect - say, a microscopic pinhole or dust particle - in these conductive structures can impact device performance, from loss of speed to complete failure. The SABRE® ECD product family, which helped pioneer the copper interconnect transition, offers the precision needed for copper damascene manufacturing in logic and memory. System capabilities include cobalt deposition for logic applications and copper deposition directly on various liner materials, which is important for next-generation metallization schemes. For advanced packaging applications, such as forming conductive bumps, redistribution layers, TSV filing, and wafer level bonding, the SABRE® 3D family combines Lam’s SABRE Electrofill® technology with additional innovation to deliver the high-quality films needed at high productivity. The modular architecture can be configured with multiple plating and pre/post-treatment cells, providing flexibility to address a variety of packaging applications, including HBM.SPEED® Product FamilyDielectric gapfill processes deposit critical insulation layers between conductive and/or active areas by filling openings of various aspect ratios between conducting lines and between devices. With advanced devices, the structures being filled can be very tall and narrow. As a result, high-quality dielectric films are especially important due to the ever-increasing possibility of cross-talk and device failure. Our SPEED® HDP-CVD products provide a multiple dielectric film solution for high-quality gapfill with industry-leading throughput and reliability. SPEED® products have excellent particle performance, and their design allows large batch sizes between cleans and faster cleans.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 5Table of ContentsStriker® Product FamilyThe latest memory, logic, and imaging devices require extremely thin, highly conformal dielectric films for continued device performance improvement and scaling. For example, ALD films are critical for low-k spacers for device power consumption/speed, dielectric gapfills in high aspect ratio features for isolation and device performance, as well as for spacer-based multiple patterning schemes where the spacers help define critical dimensions. These applications have little tolerance for voids and even the smallest defect. The Striker® single-wafer ALD products provide dielectric film solutions for these challenging requirements through application-specific material, process and hardware options that deliver film technology and defect performance. VECTOR® Product FamilyDielectric film deposition processes are used to form some of the most difficult-to-produce insulating layers in a semiconductor device, including those used in the latest transistors and 3D structures. In some applications, these films require dielectric films to be exceptionally uniform and defect free since slight imperfections are multiplied greatly in subsequent layers. Our VECTOR® PECVD products are designed to provide the performance and flexibility needed to create these enabling structures within a wide range of challenging device applications. As a result of its design, VECTOR® produces superior thin film quality, along with exceptional within-wafer and wafer-to-wafer uniformity. Etch Processes and Product FamiliesEtch processes create chip features by selectively removing dielectric, metal, silicon and poly silicon materials, including films that have been added during deposition. Reactive ion etch processing enables device-critical formation steps to enable transistor performance, create storage capacitors, and memory cells. Low temperature, cryogenic etching enables the use of new, novel chemistries to deliver increased high aspect ratio etch capability.Flex® Product FamilyDielectric etch carves patterns in insulating materials to create barriers between the electrically conductive parts of a semiconductor device. For advanced devices, these structures can be extremely tall and thin and involve complex, sensitive materials. Slight deviations from the target feature profile - even at the atomic level - can negatively affect electrical properties of the device. To precisely create these challenging structures, our Flex® product family offers differentiated technologies and application-focused capabilities for critical dielectric etch applications. Uniformity, repeatability, and tunability are enabled by a unique multi-frequency, small-volume, confined plasma design. Flex® offers in situ multi-step etch and continuous plasma capability that delivers high productivity with low defectivity.Vantex® Product FamilyDielectric etch processes remove non-conductive materials during the manufacturing of a semiconductor device. Leading-edge memory devices have especially challenging structures, such as extremely deep holes and trenches, that must be manufactured with tight tolerances. Our latest dielectric etch system, Vantex® creates high aspect ratio device features while maintaining critical dimension (“CD”) uniformity and selectivity. Vantex® is part of our Sense.i® platform and offers advanced RF technology and repeatable wafer-to-wafer performance enabled by Equipment Intelligence® solutions to meet the needs of advanced memory manufacturing, primarily in 3D NAND high aspect ratio hole, trench, contact, and capacitor cell applications.Kiyo® Product FamilyConductor etch helps shape the electrically active materials used in the parts of a semiconductor device. Even a slight variation in these miniature structures can degrade device performance. In fact, these structures are so tiny and sensitive that etch processes push the boundaries of the basic laws of physics and chemistry. Our Kiyo® product family delivers the high-performance capabilities needed to precisely and consistently form these features precisely and with high productivity. Proprietary Hydra technology in Kiyo® products improves CD uniformity by correcting for incoming pattern variability, and atomic-scale variability control with production-worthy throughput.Syndion® Product Family Plasma etch processes used to remove silicon and other materials deep into the wafer are collectively referred to as deep silicon etch. These may be deep trenches for CMOS image sensors, trenches for power and other devices, TSVs for HBM and advanced packaging, and other high aspect ratio features. These are created by etching through multiple materials sequentially, where each new material involves a change in the etch process. The Syndion® etch product family is optimized for deep silicon etch, providing the fast process switching with depth and cross-wafer uniformity control required to achieve precision etch results. The systems support both conventional single-step etch and rapidly alternating process, which minimizes damage and delivers precise depth uniformity.Versys® Metal Product FamilyMetal etch processes play a key role in connecting the individual components that form an IC, such as forming wires and electrical connections. These processes can also be used to drill through metal hardmasks that are used to form the wiring for advanced devices. To enable these critical etch steps, the Versys® Metal product family provides high-productivity capability on a flexible Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 6Table of Contentsplatform. Superior CD, profile uniformity, and uniformity control are enabled by a symmetrical chamber design with independent process tuning features.Clean Processes and Product FamiliesClean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to clear away particles, contaminants, residues and other unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing. Wet processing technologies can be used for wafer cleaning and etch applications. Plasma bevel cleaning is used to enhance die yield by removing unwanted materials from the wafer’s edge that could impact the device area. Coronus® Product FamilyBevel cleaning removes unwanted masks, residues, and films from the edge of a wafer between manufacturing steps. If not cleaned, these materials become defect sources. For instance, they can flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent processes. Even a single particle that lands on a critical part of a device can ruin the entire chip. By inserting bevel clean processes at strategic points, these potential defect sources can be eliminated and more functional chips produced. By combining the precise control and flexibility of plasma with technology that protects the active die area, the Coronus® bevel clean family cleans the wafer’s edge to enhance die yield. The systems provide active die area protection by using plasma processing with proprietary confinement technology. Applications include post-etch, pre- and post-deposition, pre-lithography, and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps.DV-Prime®, Da Vinci®, EOS®, and SP Series Product FamiliesWafer cleaning is performed repeatedly during semiconductor device manufacturing and is a critical process that affects product yield and reliability. Unwanted microscopic materials - some no bigger than the tiny structures themselves - need to be cleaned effectively. At the same time, these processes must selectively remove residues that are chemically similar to the device films. For advanced WLP, the wet clean steps used between processes that form the package and external wiring have surprisingly complex requirements. These processes are called on to completely remove specific materials and leave other fragile structures undisturbed. In IoT products that include power devices, MEMS and image sensors, there is a unique requirement for wafer backside wet etch to uniformly thin the silicon wafer while protecting the device side of the wafer.Based on our pioneering single-wafer spin technology, the DV-Prime® and Da Vinci® products provide the process flexibility needed with high productivity to address a wide range of wafer cleaning steps throughout the manufacturing process flow. As the latest of Lam’s wet clean products, EOS® delivers exceptionally low on-wafer defectivity and high throughput to address progressively demanding wafer cleaning applications. With a broad range of process capability, our SP Series products deliver cost-efficient, production-proven wet clean and silicon wet etch solutions for challenging WLP and IoT applications.

Refer to Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K, for the attribution of revenue by geographic region. Long-lived AssetsRefer to Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K, for information concerning the geographic locations of long-lived assets.CustomersOur customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers continue to establish joint ventures, alliances, and licensing arrangements which have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunities. Refer to Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for information concerning customer concentrations. Our most significant customers during the fiscal years ending June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023 included Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.A material reduction in orders from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses, in turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated market demand for ICs, and the availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.ManufacturingOur manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of our customers. The assembly and testing of our products is conducted predominately in cleanroom environments. We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. These outsourcing contracts may provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for further information concerning our outsourcing commitments, reported as a component of purchase obligations.Certain components and sub-assemblies that we include in our products may only be obtained from a single supplier.

Our Global Impact Report for calendar year 2024 details, among other items, a number of ESG goals. One such goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which we are working to achieve in part by meeting a number of interim targets related to our environmental impact. There have been no material impacts to capital expenditures or our results of operations associated with this goal, and there are no material cash commitments associated with the goal as of the fiscal year ended June 29, 2025.Information contained on our website or in our annual Global Impact Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.CompetitionThe semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial resources targeted to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment suppliers in many areas, including but not limited to process performance, productivity, defect control, customer support, and overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, and similar factors. Our ability to succeed in the marketplace depends upon our ability to manufacture and ship products on a timeline that meets our customers’ needs, maintain existing products, and introduce product enhancements and new products that meet customer requirements on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of competition from third-party spare parts providers.We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Our primary competitor in the dielectric and metals deposition market is Applied Materials, Inc. For ALD and PECVD, we also compete against ASM International and Wonik IPS. In the etch market, our primary competitors are Applied Materials, Inc.; Hitachi, Ltd.; and Tokyo Electron, Ltd., and our primary competitors in the wet clean market are Screen Holding Co., Ltd.; Semes Co., Ltd.; and Tokyo Electron, Ltd.We face competition from a number of established and emerging equipment companies in the industry. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes, to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance characteristics, and to provide more comprehensive offerings of products. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. Government and other initiatives to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain in countries outside of the U.S., including China, could increase competition from domestic equipment and spare parts manufacturers in those countries. Additionally, the U.S. Government has enacted a number of export controls regulating the sales of certain technologies to customers in China, including entity listings of Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 9Table of Contentsmultiple customers, thus restricting the sales of equipment and spare parts by U.S. equipment suppliers. This provides an advantage to our international competitors that are not subject to these restrictions. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Patents and LicensesOur policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications covering various aspects of our products and processes. Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately one to twenty years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they alone will not determine our success. Our success depends principally upon our research and development, engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes and may be more limited in our ability to exclude competitors than would otherwise be the case. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this report.Human Capital We endeavor to be a great place to work globally by investing in a multi-faceted strategy that is rooted in building an inclusive workplace. To support our employees, we tailor our programs to meet the unique cultural needs and priorities within different regions around the world.As of August 7, 2025, we had approximately 19,000 regular full-time employees, of which over 29% were engaged in research and development. Approximately 43% of our regular full-time employees are located in the United States, 50% in Asia, and 7% in Europe. Employment, Recruitment and Development Our talented people are what makes our success possible. Many of our recruitment efforts are carried out through partnerships with key universities. In fact, many of our senior executives began their careers with us right out of college, demonstrating that programs that recruit university students have the potential to contribute to our leadership pipeline. To tap into the best and brightest students, we prioritize core initiatives including an internship program, campus events, and thesis awards and scholarships. Through the spirit of continuous improvement, we accelerate skill building and development, create career opportunities, and expand professional networks for employees. We provide a wide range of opportunities globally to support our commitment to developing the best talent. Our mentorship, coaching, and professional development programs support this commitment along with our self-directed online learning platform that intelligently aligns content with skill building needs. Additionally, our leadership development programs are designed to scale leadership across our business, empowering leaders to motivate, inspire, and lead employees through change, ultimately accelerating business outcomes. Employee Engagement Employee engagement (i.e. satisfaction) and voice are critical to Lam’s culture. We conduct a global survey at a regular cadence to gather input from employees on culture, career opportunity, and manager effectiveness. We also solicit employee feedback through in-person and online employee forums, engagement sessions, all-employee meetings, conversations with managers, and our Human Resource Support and Employee Relations programs.Total Rewards Our Total Rewards program incorporates a comprehensive compensation and benefits package aimed at supporting employees and their families with financial, physical, and mental well-being programs that meet their needs. We conduct an annual review of salaries and benefits packages using third-party benchmarking surveys to ensure that our offerings are aligned with the marketplace and attractive to top talent. We offer our employees a competitive 401(k) benefit, an employee stock purchase plan, tuition reimbursement, and annual cash bonuses. Stock awards are offered to executives and select employees. We recognize the importance of time away from work, so we offer annual paid holidays and time off to relax and recharge or take care of personal business. Additionally, we offer paid parental leave benefits for parents welcoming a new child to the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Employee Health and SafetyPrioritizing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is critical to our ongoing success. We invest in education, awareness, monitoring, and prevention programs to help recognize and control safety hazards. Our goal is to apply our environmental health and safety (“EHS”) policies, programs, and response plans to anywhere we operate and to extend them to anyone who works on our sites with the intent to provide a safe environment during both routine and extraordinary circumstances. People managers in field support, manufacturing, R&D, warehouse, and logistics operations undergo formal safety leadership training biannually to enhance their skills in safety management and communication. We screen contractors’ safety performance and require contractor compliance with specified safety standards. Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 10Table of ContentsWe monitor our safety performance at the enterprise, regional, and site levels. By using our global incident tracking system, our corporate EHS team can assess and monitor safety trends to report to business units and executive leadership as a part of quarterly reviews. We maintain multi-site certifications for ISO 45001, the globally recognized standard for occupational health and safety management systems.

As a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER RISKSWe Depend on Creating New Products and Processes and Enhancing Existing Products and Processes for Our Success; Consequently, We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological ChangeRapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. In addition, the emergence of “big data” and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”) that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers and equipment manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit those tools to advance technology development. In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customers’ requirements. Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 12Table of ContentsIn order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of products and technologies, to invest in or acquire businesses or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us. We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities that do not have the same benefits as acquisitions. Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition may pose substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both. Moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next-generation devices. This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.We Face a Challenging and Complex Competitive EnvironmentWe face significant competition from multiple competitors, and our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to identify those future customer requirements, to devote appropriate resources to developing products to address those requirements, or to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.With increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures. Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers’ needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D. Technological changes and developing technologies have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments. Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. In addition, we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do, who are able to sell products for certain applications at certain customers that we are prohibited from selling to under applicable export controls, allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match and potentially contributing to the strengthening of such companies’ ability to compete with us. In many cases, speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives. For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to That CustomerSemiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment for the same product line application.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 13Table of ContentsThe Semiconductor Capital Equipment Industry Is Subject to Variability and Periods of Rapid Growth or Decline; We Therefore Face Risks Related to Our Strategic Resource Allocation DecisionsThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. Variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. The variability in our customers’ investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including, but not limited to, electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities, which can be made more challenging due to the multi-year nature of investments made in certain technology programs and other initiatives.During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.Future Declines in the Semiconductor Industry, and the Overall World Economic Conditions on Which It Is Significantly Dependent, Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOur business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. The economic, regulatory, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and services and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty, our customers’ budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, changing economic, regulatory, political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition, including, but not limited to: •a decline in demand for our products and/or services;•an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us;•an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;•valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;•restructuring charges;•asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;•a decline in the value of our investments;•exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition; and•challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in R&D and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.We Have a Limited Number of Key CustomersSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall shipments, revenue, cash flows and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict. In addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us and limitations on our ability to share technology with others. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 14Table of ContentsStrategic Alliances and Customer Consolidation May Have Negative Effects on Our BusinessSemiconductor manufacturing companies from time to time enter into strategic alliances or consolidate with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. The outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. In addition, the outcomes of consolidation can potentially lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers’ operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors’ products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. Even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights, that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKSOur Revenues and Operating Results Are VariableOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:•legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including, but not limited to, changes in import/export regulations and tariffs, such as regulations imposed by the U.S. government restricting exports to China, or potential additional tariffs on imports, and tariffs imposed by other countries) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;•macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including those caused by war, conflict in the Middle East, bank failures; uncertainty regarding economic and other policies and priorities; and geopolitical issues;•the impact of reductions in government spending;•changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;•economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;•the size and timing of orders from customers;•changes in our deferred revenue balance, including as a result of factors such as volume purchase agreements, multi-year service contracts, back orders, and down payments toward purchases;•consolidation of the customer base, which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services;•procurement shortages;•the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;•manufacturing difficulties;•customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, customer payments, and/or customer acceptances;•the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;•our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new, enhanced, and competitive products in a timely manner;•our competitors’ introduction of new products;•legal or technical challenges to our products and technologies;•transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, international conflict, widespread outbreak of illness, or natural or man-made disasters (including disasters resulting from climate change), including earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and heat waves;•management of supply chain risks;•effects of inflation or interest rates; and•changes in our estimated effective tax rate.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 15Table of ContentsOur Business Relies on Technology, Data, Intellectual Property and Other Sensitive Information That is Susceptible to Cybersecurity and Other Threats or IncidentsOur business is dependent upon the use and protection of technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, which may be owned by, or licensed to, us or third parties, such as our customers and vendors. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the creation, transmission, use and storage of much of this information, and for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include, but are not limited to, telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications, and email. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and Cloud providers. In addition, we make use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers, or third-party networks and servers, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the Internet for their function. The technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect are subject to loss, release, misappropriation or misuse, and the information systems containing or transmitting such technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information are subject to disruption, breach or failure, in each case as a result of various possible causes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. Such causes may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment, in each case with respect to us or the third-party product and service providers upon which we rely. Such causes may also include the use of techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. In addition, to the extent AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, they may be used to identify vulnerabilities and to implement increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. Further, the use of AI by us, our customers, suppliers, and third-party providers, among others, may also introduce unique vulnerabilities whose existence or exploitation could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations.We experience cybersecurity and other threats and incidents in the course of our operations. Although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents in the future. Cybersecurity or other incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such adverse effects might include:•loss of (or inability to access, e.g. through ransomware) confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems;•the disruption of the proper function of our products, services and/or operations;•the failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes;•errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work;•the loss or public exposure of the personal or other confidential information of our employees, customers or other parties;•the public release of customer financial and business plans, customer orders and operational results;•exposure to claims from our employees or third parties who are adversely impacted by such incidents; •misappropriation or theft of our or a customer’s, supplier’s or other party’s assets or resources, including technology, data, intellectual property or other sensitive information and costs associated therewith;•reputational damage;•diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; or•our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations, such as the timely publication or filing of financial statements, tax information, and other required communications.While we have implemented International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on and to the technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information we seek to protect, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe, and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen. In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our Future Success Depends Heavily on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations Non-U.S. sales, as reflected in Part II Item 7. Results of Operations of this 2025 Form 10-K, accounted for approximately 93%, 93%, and 91% of total revenue in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 16Table of ContentsWe are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:•domestic and international trade regulations, policies, practices, relations, disputes and issues;•domestic and international tariffs, export controls and other barriers;•developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources;•global or national economic and political conditions;•changes in currency controls;•differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;•our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;•changes in and compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including U.S. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, international data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-boycott, environmental, tax, and labor laws;•fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;•the need for technical support resources in different locations; and•our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the world’s major trading nations, that political, diplomatic and national security influences can lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This can adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact, and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.Tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers, sanctions, the termination or modification of trade agreements, trade zones, and other duty mitigation initiatives, and any reciprocal retaliatory actions, can increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, disrupt our supply chain operations, or inhibit our ability to sell products or provide services, which has had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. Certain of our international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments, and our inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, has limited and could in the future further limit the market for our products and has had and could in the future have an adverse impact on our revenues. As is discussed below under the heading “Our Sales to Customers in China, a Significant Region for Us, Have Been Impacted, and are Likely to Be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and China,” the U.S. government has in recent years imposed new controls, including expanded export license requirements and restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities that significantly impact trade with China. In addition, the U.S. government has an ongoing process of assessing technologies that may be subject to new or additional export controls, and it is possible that such additional controls, if and when imposed, could further adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. The implementation by the U.S. government of broad export controls restricting access to our technology (such as recent controls limiting exports to China) may cause customers with international operations to reconsider their use of and reliance on our products, which could adversely impact our future revenue and profits and strengthen competitors who are not subject to such restrictions. Furthermore, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, take retaliatory actions; insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our ability to compete as well as our revenues and margins.Our customers (and their customers and other downstream parties) may also be adversely affected by the tariffs, export controls and other trade issues described above. Additionally, certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. The supplies, equipment, raw materials and other inputs necessary for the businesses of our customers and other downstream parties could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, reduced availability of labor, transit disruptions, consolidation in their supply chain, export controls, sanctions, trade restrictions, tariffs, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, conflict, or political conditions. If the ability of downstream parties to source the inputs needed to produce their products is impaired, then demand for our products may be adversely impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. Currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in Japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, and Indian rupee. In addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. We believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 17Table of Contentspurposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. Therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.The magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. Certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. Since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.Disruptions to Our Supply Chain and Outsource Providers Could Impact Our Ability to Meet Demand, Increase Our Costs, and Adversely Impact Our Revenue and Operating ResultsOur supply chain has played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support. Our business depends on our timely supply of products and services to meet the demand from our customers, which depends in significant part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from our direct suppliers to us, and to our direct suppliers by other companies. In addition, outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role both in the manufacturing and customer-focused operations described above, and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or perform services or to recognize revenue, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, materials or services, including increased costs due to tariffs, rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in certain countries;•shipment delays and increased costs of shipment due to transportation interruptions, capacity constraints, or fuel shortages;•shortages of semiconductor or other components or materials as a result of increases in demand or decreases in supply, including as a result of export restrictions on particular parts or materials used by us or our direct or indirect suppliers;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•transportation or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, international conflict, widespread outbreak of illness, or natural or man-made disasters (including disasters resulting from climate change), including earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and heat waves.Demand for electronic products and other factors, have resulted in, and may in the future result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture, deliver and install our products, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions. Such shortages, delays and unpredictability have adversely impacted, and may in the future impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand. In addition, difficulties in obtaining parts, materials or services necessary to deliver or install products or perform services have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our ability to recognize revenue, our gross margins on the revenue we recognize, and our other operating results. Although we are endeavoring to pass along some of the impact of increased costs to our customers to counteract adverse impacts to our gross margins and other operating results, such measures could be unsuccessful, or could have the effect of reducing demand, which would adversely impact our revenue.Further, increased restrictions imposed on a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), which are widely used in a large number of products, including parts and materials that are incorporated into our products, may negatively impact our supply chain due to the potentially decreased availability, or non-availability, of PFAS-containing products. Proposed regulations under consideration could require that we transition away from the usage of PFAS-containing products, which could adversely impact our business, operations, revenue, costs, and competitive position. There is no assurance that suitable replacements for PFAS-containing parts and materials will be available at similar costs, or at all. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In some cases, the requirements Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 18Table of Contentsof our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where we conduct our manufacturing. There is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.We May Not Achieve the Expected Benefits of Our Restructuring Plans and Business Transformation Initiatives, and These Efforts Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Operations, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Competitive PositionIn January 2023, we announced that we were implementing a restructuring plan consisting of a workforce reduction, and that we anticipated undertaking, and may in the future undertake, additional business restructuring, realignment and transformation initiatives. While the restructuring plan was intended to better align our cost structure with the current economic environment and future business opportunities, and our anticipated transformation initiatives have the goal of strengthening our operations and achieving operational efficiencies, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these plans and initiatives. Implementation of such plans and initiatives may be costly and disruptive to our business, we may not be able to complete them at the cost or within the time frame contemplated, and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated benefits within the projected timing or at all. Restructuring and transformation may adversely affect our internal programs and our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, may result in a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods, may require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and may be distracting to employees and management, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Additionally, reductions in our workforce may cause a reduction in our production output capabilities which could impact our ability to manufacture or ship products to customers within a mutually beneficial timeline. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. For more information about our restructuring plan, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K.We Face Risks Related to the Disruption of Our Primary Manufacturing and R&D FacilitiesWhile we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing and R&D facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations. These locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters (including disasters resulting from climate change), including earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and heat waves, widespread outbreaks of illness, war, terrorist activities, political or governmental unrest or instability, disruptions of our information technology resources, utility interruptions, international conflict, or other events beyond our control. Such disruptions may cause delays in developing or shipping our products, in engaging with customers on new product applications, or in supporting customers, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.Epidemics, Pandemics or Outbreaks of Diseases May Adversely Impact Our Business, Operations, and Financial ResultsEpidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of diseases may arise at any time and may have significant business, operational, and financial impacts. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has in the past and additional global heath crises may in the future result in efforts by national, state and local governments worldwide to control the applicable disease’s spread. Such governmental efforts may result in measures aimed at containing the applicable disease such as quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns, and shelter in place or “stay at home” orders, which collectively have the potential to significantly restrict the ability of businesses to operate. In addition, restrictions resulting from global health crises and related measures aimed at containing the applicable disease, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, in connection with a pandemic or disease outbreak, may affect our business and operations by, among other things, causing facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; disrupting production by our supply chain; disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that impede manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by portions of our workforce. These impacts may cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations, which may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. Global health crises may also have significant macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty. This may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers, and our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.
Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 19Table of ContentsWe Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue DiversificationWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. Our products are priced up to the tens of millions of dollars per system. As a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:•a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;•a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;•export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets;•an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate;•increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;•increased pressure from regional competitors;•technological changes that we are unable to address with our products;•slower than anticipated development of various target markets that utilize new technologies; or•a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of “big data” or other new technologies such as machine learning and AI. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. Our business is affected by our customers’ use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.We May Fail to Protect Our Critical Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our BusinessOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. Protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. As part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. However, we may fail to apply for or obtain sufficient patent protection for our technology, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the U.S. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties’ intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. Additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the United States or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. The rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, copyrights, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. Moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Motivate Key Employees Is Critical to Our SuccessOur ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. This has been and may continue to be an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. Our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Businesses, Product Lines, and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial PerformanceAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management’s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 20Table of Contentstechnologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.In addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our Common Stock.LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKSIncreasing and Evolving Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating ResultsWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, sale, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and the regulatory environment is dynamic. Failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations (such as future regulations imposed on the use or sale of PFAS or PFAS-containing products) could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. These regulations could require us to alter or discontinue our current operations in certain jurisdictions, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. Compliance obligations, as well as any failure to comply with current or future regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances (including, but not limited to, PFAS) could subject us to future costs and liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.Our Sales to Customers in China, a Significant Region for Us, Have Been Impacted, and are Likely to Be Materially and Adversely Affected by Export License Requirements and Other Regulatory Changes, or Other Governmental Actions in the Course of the Trade Relationship Between the U.S. and ChinaChina represents a large and fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore is important to our business. Revenue in China, which includes global customers and domestic Chinese customers with manufacturing facilities in China, represented approximately 34%, 42%, and 26% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The U.S. and China have historically had a complex relationship that has included actions that have impacted trade between the two countries. In recent years, these actions have included an expansion of export license requirements imposed by the U.S. government, which have limited the market for our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition, and could potentially do so to an even greater extent in the future. Additionally, the U.S. government has enacted new rules aimed at restricting China’s ability to manufacture advanced semiconductors, which include restrictions on exports, reexports or transfers to, or shipping, transmitting, transferring, or facilitating such movement to, or performing services at, customer facilities in China engaged in certain technology end-uses, without appropriate authorizations obtained from U.S. authorities. The U.S. Department of Commerce has also enacted rules that have expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses; has added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list and unverified list under suspicion of military-civil fusion, support of Russia, or other factors associated with a broadening scope of national security concerns; and has expanded an existing rule (referred to as the foreign direct product rule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items produced with many of our products to be subject to U.S. licensing requirements if Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”) or its affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. These rules have required and may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to customers in China, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our customers (including, but not limited to, Chinese customers) may require U.S. export licenses for the use of our products in order to manufacture products, including semiconductor wafers and integrated circuits, for those of their customers (i.e. Huawei and its affiliates) that are subject to the expanded foreign direct product rule, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. The U.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or unverified list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue. The implementation, interpretation, and impact on our business of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and these rules, other regulatory actions or changes, and other actions taken by the governments of either the U.S. or China, or both, that have occurred and may occur in the future could weaken our competitive position and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Intellectual Property, Indemnity, and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and We Could Lose Significant Rights That Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and ProfitabilityThird parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. From time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 21Table of Contentsissues. We also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. In addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our Board of Directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. Moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.We Are Exposed to Various Risks from Our Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-boycott compliance, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, antitrust regulations, and laws or regulations relating to carbon emissions such as the recent reporting requirements imposed by the State of California that will require corporations to provide climate-related disclosures, as well as other laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns, among others. Each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management’s attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we do not fully comply.To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced operating income, and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to Additional Tax LiabilitiesWe are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. The amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. Changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, in material audit assessments, or in expirations of agreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States.Recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 (“BEPS 2.0”) project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries, including the implementation of a global minimum tax. Several countries around the world have enacted or proposed changes to their existing tax laws based on these recommendations. As each country in which we operate evaluates their alignment with the recommendations and enacts minimum tax rules, the ultimate impact of any such changes on our effective tax rate remains uncertain. When fully enacted, such changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. We will continue to monitor the progress of the BEPS 2.0 implementation.Our Bylaws Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Judicial Forum for Certain Legal Actions Between the Company and its Stockholders, Which May Discourage Lawsuits with Respect to Such Claims Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent otherwise, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for lawsuits asserting certain stockholder claims (including claims asserted derivatively for our benefit), such as claims against directors and officers for breach of a fiduciary duty, claims arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This is a general summary of the bylaw provision; you should refer to the language of the bylaws for details. While the forum provision does not generally apply to direct claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, derivative lawsuits that assert legal claims arising under these statutes could fall within the provision, as recent court decisions have held. Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 22Table of ContentsAs a Delaware corporation, Delaware law controls issues of our internal affairs, including duties that our directors, officers, employees, and others owe to the Company and its stockholders. We believe that our exclusive forum provision benefits us, and our stockholders, by permitting relatively prompt resolution of lawsuits concerning our internal affairs, promoting consistent application of Delaware law in these lawsuits, and reducing the possibility of duplicative, costly, multi-jurisdictional litigation with the potential for inconsistent outcomes. However, the forum provision limits a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes may be more favorable than Delaware, and this could discourage the filing of such lawsuits.FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKSThe Market for Our Common Stock Is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions or May Subject Our Business to Additional CostsThe market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:•general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;•economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions such as uncertainty regarding economic and other policies and priorities;•macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, including those caused by war, conflict in the Middle East or elsewhere, or bank failures; and geopolitical issues;•the impact of reductions in government spending;•variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;•variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;•margin trading, short sales, hedging and derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;•government regulations;•developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;•technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•commercial success or failure of our new and existing products; or•disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers.In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. These and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our Common Stock.We May Incur Impairments to Goodwill or Long-lived AssetsWe review our goodwill identified in business combinations for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed the fair value. We review all other long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets requires judgment. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our Common Stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. When evaluating goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. When evaluating other long-lived assets, if we conclude that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. Additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 23Table of ContentsOur Leverage and Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Earnings per ShareWe have $4.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding (the “Senior Notes”). Additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.5 billion commercial paper program and our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $750.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.75 billion. We may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.In addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. We could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:•risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;•a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and•impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. Furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. As a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.Our Credit Agreements Contain Covenant Restrictions That May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our BusinessWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;•create liens;•enter into transactions with our affiliates;•change the nature of our business;•sell certain assets; and•merge or consolidate with any person.Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Declare Cash Dividends or Repurchase Our Shares at All or in Any Particular AmountsOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since April 2014. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock.If One or More of Our Counterparty Financial Institutions Default on Their Obligations To Us or Fail, We May Incur Significant LossesAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions both in and out of the United States. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions, which may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 24Table of Contentsbecome insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C.    CybersecurityWe recognize the significant role of information security in safeguarding our valuable intellectual property along with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data of our customers, employees, and suppliers.

During fiscal year 2025, our quarterly dividend declared was $0.23 per share. Repurchases of Company SharesIn May 2024, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $10.0 billion of Common Stock; this authorization supplements the remaining balance from any prior authorization. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn April 30, 2025, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (the "April 2025 ASRs") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 5.2 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on April 30, 2025. The total number of shares received under the April 2025 ASRs will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the April 2025 ASRs will occur no later than September 8, 2025.Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchased AveragePrice Paidper Share (1,2)Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plansor ProgramsAmountAvailableUnderRepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 30, 2024$10,824,660 Quarter ended September 29, 202411,952 $83.97 11,952 9,821,006 Quarter ended December 29, 20248,336 $78.03 8,336 9,170,561 Quarter ended March 30, 20254,448 $77.91 4,448 8,824,012 March 31, 2025 - April 27, 20254,289 (3)$67.06 4,289 (3)8,536,414 April 28, 2025 - May 25, 20258,891 $77.23 8,891 7,749,275 May 26, 2025 - June 29, 20252,583 $89.85 2,583 7,517,184 Total 40,499 $76.18 (4)40,499 $7,517,184 (1)Average price paid per share excludes the effect of accelerated share repurchase activities.

We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale manufacturing enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, cloud and enterprise servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.Our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as NVM, DRAM, and logic devices. Their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer.Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires a sequence of highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.Demand from cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. We believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition, etch, and clean markets to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency. Several factors create opportunities for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners, including our close-to-customer focus; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.Wafer fabrication equipment spending levels were strong in the 2025 fiscal year driven by an increase in both the memory and non-memory market segments. In the short term, volatility in the semiconductor industry environment from trade restrictions, tariffs, as well as other direct and indirect risks and uncertainties, have had, and in the future may have, a negative impact on our revenue and operating margin. Over the longer term, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors, combined with technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will drive sustainable growth and lead to an increase in the served available market for our products and services in the deposition, etch, and clean businesses.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 29Table of ContentsOn October 2, 2024, the Company effected a ten-for-one stock split of its common stock and a proportional increase in the number of authorized shares.

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 largely due to improved factory efficiencies and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased transformational charges. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 was driven by higher employee-related costs primarily as a result of increased headcount, increased spending on transformational activities, and higher outside service expense. Fiscal year 2024 revenue decreased 14.5% compared to fiscal year 2023. Systems and customer-support related revenues declined in fiscal year 2024 primarily from weakness in the non-volatile memory market, partially offset by strength in DRAM as well as increased revenue generation from our China regional customers. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 largely due to a more favorable customer mix, lower spending on material costs, and higher field resource utilization, partially offset by lower factory efficiencies. The increase in operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by higher employee-related costs primarily as a result of increased research and development-related headcount, increased spending on transformational activities, higher deferred compensation plan-related costs, and increased spending on supplies. We aim to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, as well as performance to our operational and financial objectives. As a result, from time to time, we exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries of products, which has impacted, including in the current fiscal year, and may in the future impact, the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products.Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances totaled approximately $6.4 billion as of June 29, 2025, compared to $5.9 billion as of June 30, 2024. Cash flows provided from operating activities were $6.2 billion for fiscal year 2025 compared to $4.7 billion for fiscal year 2024. Cash flows provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2025 were primarily used for $3.4 billion in treasury stock purchases, including net share settlement of employee stock-based compensation; $1.1 billion in dividends paid to our stockholders; $759 million of capital expenditures; and $507 million of principal payment on debt instruments and debt issuance costs.

Under the plan, we terminated approximately 1,760 employees, incurring expenses related to employee severance and separation costs. Employee severance and separation costs are primarily related to severance, non-cash severance, including equity award compensation expense, pension and other termination benefits. Additionally, we made a strategic decision to relocate certain manufacturing activities to pre-existing facilities. The restructuring plan was substantially complete as of June 30, 2024. Restructuring charges decreased during fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily due to lower employee severance and separation costs.

Interest income increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily because of higher yields and higher cash balances.Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 primarily due to the maturity of $500 million of the Company’s senior notes in March 2025. Interest expense was flat in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 32Table of ContentsThe gains on deferred compensation plan related assets, net were driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of the underlying funds for all periods presented.Foreign exchange fluctuations were primarily due to currency movements against portions of our unhedged balance sheet exposures for all periods presented.The variation in other, net for the fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was primarily driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of equity investments. Income Tax Expense Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: Year EndedChangeJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023FY25 vs. FY24FY24 vs. FY23 (in thousands, except percentages and basis points)Income tax expense$599,912 $532,450 $598,279 $67,462 12.7 %$(65,829)(11.0)%Effective tax rate10.1 %12.2 %11.7 %- 210 bps+ 50 bpsThe decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits from lapses of statutes of limitation in fiscal year 2025 and the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions.The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions.International revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the United States. International pre-tax income is taxable in the United States at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. Please refer to Note 7: Income Taxes of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K.On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ("OBBBA") was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. The impact on income taxes due to change in legislation is required, under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted, which is during our fiscal year 2026. In general, the OBBBA introduces changes to U.S. taxation, including changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income. We are currently assessing the potential implications of these changes to our fiscal year 2026 Consolidated Financial Statements.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. Our gross deferred tax assets were $1,897 million and $1,516 million at the end of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $197 million and $218 million and a valuation allowance primarily representing our entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California of $424 million and $389 million at the end of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The change in gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2025 and 2024 is primarily due to increases in gross deferred tax assets for outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries.We evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.Uncertain Tax Positions We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 33Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates include:•the recognition and valuation of revenue;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our accounting policies.Revenue Recognition: We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. The transaction price for our contracts with customers is allocated among the identified performance obligations and consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services as provided. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement and obsolete inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of net realizable value include but are not limited to customer demand, management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The assessment of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets includes estimation and judgement with respect to future operating results and market conditions. We have an accounting policy election to record deferred taxes related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”).We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We have a policy to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources Total gross cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances were $6.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2025 compared to $5.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program, dividends paid, capital expenditures, and principal payments on debt instruments.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 34Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $6.2 billion during fiscal year 2025 consisted of (in thousands):Net income$5,358,217 Non-cash charges:Depreciation and amortization386,277 Deferred income taxes(363,247)Equity-based compensation expense343,371 Changes in operating asset and liability accounts441,801 Other6,845 $6,173,264 Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: increases in deferred gross profit of $1.1 billion, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $328 million, and accounts payable of $212 million. These sources of cash are offset by the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $859 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $207 million, and inventory of $181 million.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2025 was $708 million, primarily consisting of $759 million in capital expenditures.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2025 was $4,937 million, primarily consisting of $3,422 million in Common Stock repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; $1,150 million of dividends paid; and $507 million of principal payments on debt instrument and debt issuance costs, partially offset by $143 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.LiquidityGiven that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash and cash equivalents as of June 29, 2025, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. However, factors outside of our control, including uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, are currently, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.In March 2025, $500 million principal value of our 2025 Notes were settled upon maturity using available cash on hand. In January 2025, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment increased the unsecured revolving credit facility commitment from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion and extended the maturity of the facility from June 2026 to January 2030. The facility provides for an expansion option that will allow us, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $750 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.75 billion. Please refer to Note 14, “Long-term Debt and Other Borrowings" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K for additional information.In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, domestic and global macroeconomic and political conditions could cause disruptions to the capital markets and otherwise make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 35Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Certain obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with GAAP include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases; refer to Notes 14 and 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K for further discussion. Our off-balance sheet arrangements and our transition tax liability are presented as purchase obligations, refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K for further discussion. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we issue purchase orders based on estimates of our production needs, many times well in advance of delivery dates. The commitments under these open purchase orders are not included in the off-balance sheet commitments disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as we generally have the option to cancel the purchase orders at our convenience, reschedule, and/or adjust quantities based on our business needs. As of June 29, 2025, we expect to fulfill approximately $387 million within one year related to these arrangements.Item 7A.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskLong-Term DebtAs of June 29, 2025, we had $4.5 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate long-term debt outstanding, with a fair value of $3.9 billion. The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes.Foreign Currency Exchange (“FX”) RiskWe conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. In addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. To protect against adverse movements in value of anticipated non-U.S. dollar transactions or cash flows, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that generally expire within 12 months and no later than 24 months. The option contracts include collars, an option strategy that is comprised of a combination of a purchased put option and a written call option with the same expiration dates and notional amounts but with different strike prices. These foreign currency hedge contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value, with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue and/or expense is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain non-U.S.-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily cash, third-party accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany receivables and payables. The change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income (expense), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities also recorded in other income (expense), net, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the hedged items. The unrealized gain of our outstanding forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, as of June 29, 2025, and the change in fair value of these cash flow hedges assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent are not significant.The unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges, as of June 29, 2025, and the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges, assuming a hypothetical foreign currency exchange rate movement of plus or minus 10 percent and plus or minus 15 percent are not significant. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net, by corresponding changes in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 36Table of ContentsItem 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThere were no

FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 29, 2025 Note 1: Company and Industry InformationThe Company designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Semiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.The Company sells its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan.The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns, such as electronics demand, memory pricing, and foundry utilization rates, may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company’s equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, economic conditions; supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors; customer capacity requirements; and the Company’s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, the Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.Common Stock Split: On October 2, 2024, the Company effected a ten-for-one stock split of its common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares. All share and per share amounts throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The par value per share remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the stock split. Reclassification: Certain amounts for the fiscal year 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheet and notes to the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2025 presentation.Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be applicable and evaluates them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.Revenue Recognition: The Company generally considers documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. The transaction price for contracts with customers is allocated among the identified performance obligations and consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. The Company generally invoices customers at shipment and for professional services as provided. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. The Company’s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year. Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement and obsolete inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of net realizable value include but are not limited to management’s forecasts related to customer demand, the Company’s future manufacturing schedules, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company’s projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which the revision is made.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 44Table of ContentsWarranty: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company provides standard warranties for its systems. The Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when it recognizes revenue. The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. All actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Plans: The Company recognizes the fair value of equity-based compensation expense. The Company determines the fair value of its service-based restricted stock units based upon the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends, and estimates the fair value of its market-based performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The Company amortizes the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and has elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of its net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that the Company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed. The Company has an accounting policy election to record deferred taxes related to GILTI.The Company recognizes the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company has a policy to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Goodwill and Intangible Assets: The valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available. The Company amortizes intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives.Goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Each component of the Company for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. All goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. The Company reviews goodwill at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In performing a qualitative assessment, it considers business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value, including goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company did not record impairments of goodwill during the years ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, or June 25, 2023.Impairment of Long-lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill): The Company reviews intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals, or other methods. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the fair value attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which the Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. For the periods presented, Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 45Table of Contentsimpairment of long-lived assets were not material. In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows. Fiscal Year: The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar, and its fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s fiscal years ending on June 29, 2025 and June 25, 2023 included 52 weeks, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 included 53 weeks.Principles of Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Cash Equivalents and Investments: Investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. The Company also invests in certain mutual funds, which include equity and fixed-income securities, related to its obligations under its deferred compensation plan, and such investments are classified as trading securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the Company’s other investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Investments classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Differences between the cost and fair value of trading securities are recognized as Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities is presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company evaluates its investments with fair value less than amortized cost by first considering whether the Company has the intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In either such situation, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Where such sales are not likely to occur, the Company considers whether a portion of the loss is the result of a credit loss. To the extent such losses are the result of credit losses, those amounts are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other differences between fair value and amortized cost are recognized in other comprehensive income. No such losses were recognized through the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the years ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024 and June 25, 2023.Allowance for Expected Credit Losses: The Company maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company evaluates its allowance for expected credit losses based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific invoices are deemed uncollectible, the Company provides a specific allowance against the amount due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. The Company also provides allowances based on its write-off history. Bad debt expense was not material for fiscal years ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023.Property and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost, less recognized impairments, if any. Equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years. Software is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Buildings are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally twenty-five years. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Amortization of finance leases is included with depreciation expense.Derivative Financial Instruments: In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company’s policy is to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on certain proposed debt instruments and exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated business exposures. The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue and expenses and net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in various foreign currencies. The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company does not believe that it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are large, global and well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company maintains an active currency hedging program and believes there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the Company’s hedging program would not be available in the future.To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts, where possible and prudent. These hedge contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates, interest rates, and other market factors.The Company considers its most current forecast in determining the level of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The revenue and expenses are hedged and designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains and losses on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations at that time.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 46Table of ContentsLeases: Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company includes renewals and terminations in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and liability when the provision is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments when the rate implicit in the lease is unknown.The Company has elected the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections for accounting under ASC 842: (i) leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; and (ii) lease and non-lease components of a contract are accounted for as a single lease component.Guarantees: The Company’s guarantees generally include certain indemnifications to its lessors for environmental matters, potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the Company’s subsidiaries, indemnifications to the Company’s customers for certain infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, indemnifications for its officers and directors, and the Company’s warranty obligations under sales of its products.Government Assistance: For government grants, the Company recognizes a benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, as a reduction to the expense for which the individual government grant (“Grant” or “Grants”) is designed to compensate, over the duration of the program when the Company has reasonable assurance that it will comply with the conditions under the Grant and that the Grant will be received. Grants related to investments in property and equipment are recognized as a reduction to the cost basis of the underlying assets with an ongoing reduction to depreciation expense over the assets’ estimated useful life. Operating-related grants are recorded as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operation as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.Foreign Currency Translation: The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily generate and expend cash in their local currency. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the fiscal period-end exchange rate, and income and expense accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates in effect for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments and are a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in Other income (expense), net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.Note 3: Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted or EffectiveIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment’s expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity’s chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard in fiscal year 2025 for the annual reporting period ending June 29, 2025, with retrospective disclosure of prior periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional footnote disclosures. Refer to Note 19: Segment, Geographic Information, and Major Customers.Updates Not Yet EffectiveIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires public entities to disclose consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and for income taxes paid. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is required to adopt this standard prospectively in fiscal year 2026 for the annual reporting period ending June 28, 2026. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional footnote disclosures.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,” which requires disaggregation of certain expenses in the notes to the financial statements to provide enhanced transparency into the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01 which clarified the effective date for entities that do not have an annual reporting period that ends on December 31st. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is required to adopt this standard in fiscal year 2028 for the annual reporting period ending June 25, 2028 either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company will apply the guidance prospectively and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its Consolidated Financial Statements.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 47Table of ContentsNote 4: RevenueDisaggregation of RevenueThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated between systems and customer-support related revenue:Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023(in thousands)Systems Revenue$11,491,280 $8,921,643 $10,695,897 Customer support-related revenue and other6,944,311 5,983,743 6,732,619 $18,435,591 $14,905,386 $17,428,516 Systems revenue includes sales of new leading-edge equipment in deposition, etch, clean and other water fabrication markets.Customer support-related revenue includes sales of customer service, spares, upgrades, and non-leading-edge equipment from the Company’s Reliant® product line.The Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

An option is a right to purchase Common Stock at a set price. A restricted stock unit award is an agreement to issue a set number of shares of Common Stock at the time of vesting. The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase its Common Stock at a discount through payroll deductions.The Lam Research Corporation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the stockholders and provides for the grant of non-qualified equity-based awards to eligible employees, consultants, advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. As of the date of stockholder approval, 192,320,680 authorized shares were available for issuance under the Plan; as of June 29, 2025, 62,666,508 shares remain available for future issuance to satisfy stock option exercises and vesting of awards.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 48Table of ContentsThe Company recognized the following equity-based compensation expense (including expense related to the employee stock purchase plan) and related income tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:  Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023 (in thousands)Equity-based compensation expense$343,371 $293,058 $286,600 Income tax benefit recognized related to equity-based compensation$22,242 $38,157 $25,794 Income tax benefit realized from the exercise and vesting of options and RSUs$28,727 $75,441 $46,495 The estimated fair value of the Company’s equity-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’ vesting terms on a straight-line basis.Restricted Stock UnitsDuring fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company issued both service-based RSUs and market-based PRSUs. Service-based RSUs typically vest annually over a period of 3 years or less. Market-based PRSUs generally vest three years from the grant date if certain performance criteria are achieved and require continued employment. For the majority of market-based PRSUs granted in the 2025 fiscal year, the number of shares that can be earned over the performance period is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to other companies in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (“XSOX”), and ranges from 0% to 150% of target. Total shareholder return is a measure of stock price appreciation in the performance period, adjusted for the reinvestment of dividends. Relative TSR performance is measured using the average closing prices of each XSOX company for the 50-trading days prior to the dates the performance period begins and ends. The target number of shares is earned based on the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the companies making up the XSOX Index. If the Company’s TSR is negative over the performance period, the payout will be capped at 100%, regardless of the percentile ranking.For market-based PRSUs granted in the 2024 and 2023 fiscal years, the number of shares that can be earned over the performance periods is based on the Company’s Common Stock price performance compared to the market price performance of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Total Return Index (“XSOX”), and ranges from 0% to 150% of target. The stock price performance or market price performance is measured using the average closing price for the 50-trading days prior to the dates the performance period begins and ends. The target number of shares represented by the market-based PRSUs is increased by 2% of target for each 1% that Common Stock price performance exceeds the market price performance of the designated benchmark index.The following table summarizes the Company’s combined service-based RSUs and market-based PRSUs:Number ofShares (in thousands)Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair ValueOutstanding, June 30, 20249,228 $65.59 Granted4,218 76.25 Vested(4,192)59.63 Forfeited or canceled(290)66.00 Outstanding, June 29, 20258,964 $74.09 Of the 8,964 thousand shares outstanding at June 29, 2025, 7,212 thousand are service-based RSUs and 1,752 thousand are market-based PRSUs. The fair value of the Company’s service-based RSUs was calculated based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. The fair value of the Company’s market-based PRSUs granted during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of the grant, resulting in a weighted average grant-date fair value per share of $85.18, $102.77, and $46.62, respectively. The total fair value of service-based RSUs and market-based RSUs that vested during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $249.9 million, $242.8 million, and $224.4 million, respectively. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had $521.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately 2.2 years.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 49Table of ContentsStock OptionsThe Company granted stock options with a 7-year maximum contractual term to a limited group of executive officers during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023. Stock options typically vest over a period of three years or less. The Company had 1,285 thousand options outstanding at June 29, 2025 with a weighted-average exercise price of $57.53 per share, of which 950 thousand were exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $49.90 per share. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had $8.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted and outstanding which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.6 years.ESPPThe Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) which allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be deducted and used to purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable purchase period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and contains one interim purchase date.During fiscal year 2025, approximately 2,468 thousand shares of the Company’s Common Stock were sold to employees under the ESPP. At June 29, 2025, approximately 48.4 million shares were available for purchase, and the Company had $47.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining period of less than ten months.

Interest income in the year ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the year ended June 25, 2023, primarily as a result of higher yields and higher cash balances.Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 primarily due to the maturity of $500 million of the Company’s senior notes in March 2025. Interest expense was flat in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.The gains on deferred compensation plan related assets, net in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of the underlying funds.The variations in other, net for the year ended June 29, 2025 compared to the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 25, 2023 were primarily driven by fluctuations in the fair market value of equity investments.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of $424.3 million primarily related to California deferred tax assets. At June 29, 2025, the Company continued to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire California deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in California.At June 29, 2025, the Company had state tax credit carryforwards of $642.2 million. Substantially all of these credits can be carried forward indefinitely.A reconciliation of income tax expense provided at the federal statutory rate (21% in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023) to actual income tax expense is as follows: Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023 (in thousands)Income tax expense computed at federal statutory rate$1,251,207 $915,647 $1,072,934 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit(13,581)(37,965)(23,252)Foreign income taxed at different rates(451,199)(313,795)(430,314)Settlements and reductions in uncertain tax positions(266,805)(18,947)(28,968)Tax credits(116,699)(125,523)(103,019)State valuation allowance, net of federal tax benefit42,759 44,916 49,073 Equity-based compensation17,391 (11,296)15,816 Increases in uncertain tax positions 138,029 62,333 34,661 Other permanent differences and miscellaneous items(1,190)17,080 11,348 $599,912 $532,450 $598,279 Effective from fiscal year 2022, the Company has a 15-year tax incentive ruling in Malaysia for one of its foreign subsidiaries. The impact of the tax incentive decreased worldwide taxes by approximately $584.8 million, $416.3 million, and $576.0 million for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The benefit of the tax incentive on diluted earnings per share was approximately $0.45, $0.32, and $0.42 in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.Earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations aggregated to approximately $1.3 billion at June 29, 2025. If these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of approximately $152.1 million at the current statutory rates. The potential tax expense associated with these foreign withholding taxes would be offset by $121.7 million of foreign tax credits that would be generated in the United States upon remittance. Other potential tax consequences, such as state income inclusions of these earnings, cannot be estimated.On July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. The impact on income taxes due to change in legislation is required, under ASC 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted, which is during the Company’s fiscal year 2026. In general, the OBBBA introduces changes to U.S. taxation, including changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income. The Company is currently assessing the potential implications of these changes to its fiscal year 2026 Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company’s gross uncertain tax positions were $720.3 million, $723.8 million, and $640.2 million as of June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023, respectively. During fiscal year 2025, gross uncertain tax positions decreased by $3.5 million. The amount of uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $604.6 million, $622.6 million, and $550.1 million, as of June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023, respectively.

The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, with the relevant taxing authorities will occur.The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign income tax returns. As of June 29, 2025, tax years 2005-2025 remain subject to examination in the jurisdictions where the Company operates.The IRS is examining the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, June 28, 2020, and June 27, 2021. To date, no significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS. The Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlements, if any, with the IRS will occur.The Company is in various stages of examinations in connection with all of its tax audits worldwide, and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled. It is reasonably possible that over the next 12-month period the Company may experience an increase or decrease in its uncertain tax positions as a result of tax examinations or lapses of statutes of limitation. The change in uncertain tax positions as a result of lapses of statutes of limitation may range up to $52.9 million, excluding interest and penalties.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 53Table of ContentsNote 8: Net Income per ShareBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method, for dilutive stock options, and restricted stock units. The following table reconciles the inputs to the basic and diluted computations for net income per share.  Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023 (in thousands, except per share data)Numerator:Net income$5,358,217 $3,827,772 $4,510,931 Denominator:Basic average shares outstanding1,286,101 1,314,102 1,354,715 Effect of potential dilutive securities:Employee stock plans4,041 5,847 3,621 Diluted average shares outstanding1,290,142 1,319,949 1,358,336 Net income per share - basic$4.17 $2.91 $3.33 Net income per share - diluted$4.15 $2.90 $3.32 For purposes of computing diluted net income per share, weighted-average common shares do not include potentially dilutive securities that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.A fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The level of an asset or liability in the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.Level 2: Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical assets or liabilities, or model-derived valuations techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities and based on non-binding, broker-provided price quotes and may not have been corroborated by observable market data.The Company engages with pricing vendors to provide fair values for a majority of its Level 1 investments. The vendors provide either a quoted market price or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Significant observable inputs include interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatility and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the foreign currency rates, forward rate curves, currency volatility and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.The Company’s primary financial instruments include its cash, cash equivalents, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and leases, and foreign currency related derivative instruments. The estimated fair value of cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. The estimated fair values of lease obligations approximate their carrying value as the majority of these obligations are generally short-term in nature and have interest rates that reset upon renewal or modification. Refer to Note 14: Long Term Debt and Other Borrowings for additional information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 54Table of ContentsThe Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains (losses) for investment sales are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The Company evaluates its investments with fair value less than amortized cost by first considering whether the Company has the intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In either such situation, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Where such sales are not likely to occur, the Company considers whether a portion of the loss is the result of a credit loss. To the extent such losses are the result of credit losses, those amounts are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other differences between fair value and amortized cost are recognized in other comprehensive income. No such losses were recognized through the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the twelve months ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023.InvestmentsInvestments are recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the fair value, and associated unrealized loss positions, if any, of mutual funds and debt and equity investments were not material. Gross realized gains/(losses) from sales of investments were insignificant in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.The financial instruments reported within Cash and cash equivalents in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 29, 2025, and June 30, 2024 consisted of the following:June 29,2025June 30,2024(in thousands)Money market funds (fair value measured on a recurring basis, level 1)$3,151,084 $2,543,462 Cash1,662,236 1,568,315 Time deposits1,577,339 1,736,079 Total$6,390,659 $5,847,856 Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company carries derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options with financial institutions with the primary objective of reducing volatility of earnings and cash flows related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swap arrangements to manage interest rate risk. The counterparties to these derivatives are large, global financial institutions that the Company believes are creditworthy, and therefore, it does not consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance to be material.Cash Flow HedgesAs of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges was not material. The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was not material as of and for the twelve months ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had an immaterial net gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to foreign exchange cash flow hedges and interest rate contracts which it expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income into earnings over the next 12 months. The total notional value of cash flow hedge instruments outstanding as of June 29, 2025 included $447.4 million of buy contracts and $323.6 million of sell contracts.Balance Sheet HedgesAs of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the fair value of outstanding balance sheet hedges was not material. The effect of the Company’s balance sheet hedge derivative instruments on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations were not material as of and for the twelve months ended June 29, 2025. The total notional value of balance sheet hedge instruments outstanding as of June 29, 2025 included $281.1 million of buy contracts and $121.5 million of sell contracts.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. Cash is placed on deposit at large, global financial institutions. Such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company’s cash are creditworthy and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 55Table of ContentsThe Company’s overall portfolio of available-for-sale securities must maintain an average minimum rating of “AA-” or “Aa3” as rated by Standard and Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, or Moody’s Investor Services. To ensure diversification and minimize concentration, the Company’s policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts that are used to mitigate the effect of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and on contracts related to structured share repurchase arrangements. These counterparties are large, global financial institutions and, to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references, and Dun & Bradstreet ratings, are performed on all new customers, and the Company monitors its customers’ financial condition and payment performance. In general, the Company does not require collateral on sales.As of June 29, 2025, three customers accounted for approximately 19%, 15% and 12% of accounts receivable, respectively.

The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 58Table of Contentsalong with an expansion option that will allow the Company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $750.0 million, for a potential total commitment of $2.75 billion. The facility matures on January 25, 2030. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at the Company’s option, based on (1) a base rate, plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.10%, or (2) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a spread of 0.70% to 1.10%, in each case plus a facility fee, with such spread and facility fee determined in accordance with the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and with the spread and facility fee based on the rating of the Company’s non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. Principal and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable upon maturity. Additionally, the Company will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on the Company’s credit rating as described above. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and was in compliance with all financial covenants.Commercial Paper ProgramOn November 13, 2017, the Company established a commercial paper program (the “CP Program”) under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion. In July 2021, the Company amended the CP Program size to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.50 billion. The net proceeds from the CP Program may be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock from time to time under the Company’s stock repurchase program. Amounts available under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The CP Program is backstopped by the Company’s Revolving Credit Arrangement. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the CP Program.

While the majority of the Company’s lease arrangements are operating leases, the Company has certain leases that qualify as finance leases.Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the right of use asset and lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments primarily include costs associated with the Company’s third-party logistics arrangements that contain one or more embedded leases. Variable lease costs will fluctuate based on factory output and material receipt volumes. Variable lease costs for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were $176.6 million, $176.6 million, and $227.7 million; respectively. Finance lease costs, including amortization of right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities; short-term rental expense for agreements less than one year in duration; and operating lease costs were immaterial for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 59Table of ContentsSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows as of June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and June 25, 2023:Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023(in thousands)Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:Operating cash flows paid for operating leases$85,558 $97,447 $74,397 Financing cash flows paid for principal portion of finance leases4,059 255,695 14,985 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:Operating leases$81,011 $146,169 $91,592 Finance leases2,884 226,519 20,161 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024:June 29,2025June 30,2024(in thousands)Operating leasesOther assets$286,980 $308,336 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities$78,707 $64,443 Other long-term liabilities193,343 223,273 Total operating lease liabilities$272,050 $287,716 As of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024 outstanding finance lease obligations were immaterial.June 29, 2025June 30, 2024Weighted-Average Remaining Lease TermWeighted-Average Discount RateWeighted-Average Remaining Lease TermWeighted-Average Discount Rate(in years)(in years)Operating leases4.93.75 %4.93.54 %As of June 29, 2025, the maturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows:Operating Leases(in thousands)2026$86,814 202766,407 202841,259 202936,836 203025,962 Thereafter43,267 Total lease payments$300,545 Less imputed interest(28,495)Total$272,050 Selected Leases and Related GuaranteesThe Company leases some of its administrative, research and development and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices, and certain equipment under non-cancelable leases. Certain of the Company’s facility leases are for buildings located at its Tualatin, Oregon campus; and certain other facility leases provide the Company with options to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 60Table of ContentsThe Company elected to exercise purchase options available under its finance leases for certain improved properties in Fremont and Livermore, California (the “California Facility Leases”) in the three months ended September 24, 2023. As a result, the Company released cash collateral in an aggregate of approximately $250 million of restricted cash that was reported in Other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, guarantees made to the lessor that each property would have a certain minimum residual value totaling $298.4 million as of June 25, 2023 in the aggregate were eliminated with the extinguishment of the California Facility Leases. As a result of the purchase of the improved properties, $250.5 million of additions were made to Property and equipment, net in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily comprised of land ($40.5 million) and buildings and improvements ($210.0 million).Note 16: Deferred Compensation PlansThe Company has an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan whereby executives may defer a portion of their compensation. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their allocation of their account balance among various mutual funds. The Company controls the investment of these funds, and the participants remain general creditors of the Company. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits on a specified date at least three years after the opening of a deferral sub-account or upon retirement. Distributions are made in the form of lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 20 years as elected by the participant. If no alternate election has been made, a lump sum payment will be made upon termination of a participant’s employment with the Company. As of June 29, 2025, and June 30, 2024, the liability of the Company to the plan participants was $423.9 million and $385.5 million, respectively, which was recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 29, 2025, and June 30, 2024, the Company had investments in the aggregate amount of $438.8 million and $393.5 million, respectively, which correlate to the deferred compensation obligations, which were recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies The Company has certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts; some of these are recorded on its balance sheet and some are not. Obligations that are recorded on the Company’s balance sheet include the Company’s operating and finance lease obligations. Obligations that are not recorded on the Company’s balance sheet include contractual relationships for purchase obligations and certain guarantees. The Company’s commitments relating to off-balance sheet agreements are included in the tables below. These amounts exclude $635.4 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions (see Note 7: Income Taxes for further discussion) as of the end of the fiscal year because the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. Other GuaranteesThe Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors for taxes and general liability under some of its agreements. The Company has entered into insurance contracts that are intended to limit its exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had not recorded any liability on its Consolidated Financial Statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company does not believe that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.The Company provides guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. As of June 29, 2025, the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $218.8 million. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid.In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers, and certain other employees, consistent with its Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation; and under local law, the Company may be required to provide indemnification to its employees for actions within the scope of their employment. Although the Company maintains insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations consist of non-cancelable significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented below contains the Company’s minimum obligations at June 29, 2025, under these arrangements and others. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 61Table of ContentsThe Company’s commitments related to these agreements as of June 29, 2025, were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year:PurchaseObligations(in thousands)2026$721,069 2027101,033 202895,589 202936,682 203022,826 Thereafter59,028 Total$1,036,227 Transition Tax LiabilityOn December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” was signed into law. Among other items, this U.S. tax reform assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. As a result, the Company recognized a total transition tax of $868.4 million and elected to pay the one-time tax over a period of 8 years, commencing in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. During fiscal year 2023, this one-time tax was adjusted, resulting in a total tax liability increase of approximately $50.0 million, which was spread over the same 8-year period. The remaining obligation related to this arrangement totals $229.6 million and is expected to be paid in fiscal year 2026. The Company may choose to apply existing tax credits, thereby reducing the actual cash payment.WarrantiesThe Company provides standard warranties on its systems. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements. As of June 29, 2025, warranty reserves totaling $16.7 million were reported in Other long-term liabilities, and the remainder were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.Changes in the Company’s product warranty reserves were as follows:  Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024 (in thousands)Balance at beginning of period$250,404 $286,663 Warranties issued during the period266,345 193,829 Settlements made during the period(193,817)(189,213)Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties(57,466)(40,875)Balance at end of period$265,466 $250,404 Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 62Table of ContentsGovernment AssistanceIn the fiscal years ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company received government assistance from various domestic and international governments in the form of cash grants or refundable tax credits. The Grants typically specify conditions that must be met in order for the Grants to be earned, such as employment or employee retention targets; completion of employee training; or the construction or acquisition of property and equipment and are often time-bound. If conditions are not satisfied or if the duration period for the arrangement is not met, the Grants are often subject to reduction, repayment, or termination. During the fiscal years ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company’s cash Grants were insignificant. During the fiscal years ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company recognized immaterial reductions to the cost basis of acquired property and equipment related to refundable tax credits earned. This reduction in the cost basis of acquired property and equipment is recorded with a corresponding reduction to taxes payable and classified under Accrued expense and other current liabilities, or Other long-term liabilities, as appropriate, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Legal ProceedingsWhile the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings that it believes material, the Company is either a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property claims. The Company accrues for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Based on current information, the Company does not believe that a material loss from known matters is probable and therefore has not recorded an accrual of any material amount for litigation or other contingencies related to existing legal proceedings.Note 18: Stock Repurchase ProgramIn May 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $10.0 billion of Common Stock; this authorization supplements the remaining balances from any prior authorizations. These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the repurchase program were as follows during the periods indicated:PeriodTotal Numberof SharesRepurchasedTotalCost ofRepurchase (3)AveragePrice PaidPer Share (1,3)Amount AvailableUnder RepurchaseProgram (in thousands, except per share data)Available balance as of June 30, 2024$10,824,660 Quarter ended September 29, 202411,952 $1,003,654 $83.97 $9,821,006 Quarter ended December 29, 20248,336 $650,445 $78.03 $9,170,561 Quarter ended March 30, 20254,448 $346,549 $77.91 $8,824,012 Quarter ended June 29, 202515,763 (2)$1,306,828 $76.18 $7,517,184 (1)    Average price paid per share excludes the effect of accelerated share repurchase activities.

Excise tax incurred reduces the amount available under the repurchase program, as applicable, and is included in the cost of shares repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity and the calculation of the average price paid per share.Accelerated Share Repurchase AgreementsOn April 30, 2025, the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (the "April 2025 ASRs") with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $500 million of Common Stock. The Company took an initial delivery of approximately 5.2 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on April 30, 2025. The total number of shares received under the April 2025 ASRs will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of the Company’s Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the April 2025 ASRs will occur no later than September 8, 2025.The Company recorded the April 2025 ASRs as equity transactions; as such, at the time of receipt, shares were included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding trade date. The Company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 63Table of ContentsNote 19: Segment, Geographic Information, and Major CustomersThe Company operates in one reportable business segment: manufacturing and servicing of wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Company’s material operating segments qualify for aggregation due to their customer base and similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. The Company's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Company's Chief Executive Officer.The Company's CODM utilizes segment gross margin as the measure of profit or loss to evaluate operating segment profitability and to assess the allocation of resources. Segment gross margin excludes both routine and non-routine expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segment, including, but not limited to, amortization of intangible assets acquired in certain business combinations, the change in value of the Company's elective deferred compensation-related liability, restructuring charges, impairment of long-lived assets, and transformational charges. Segment results are derived from the Company's internal management reporting system utilizing policies that are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes. The CODM utilizes segment revenue growth in conjunction with segment gross margin metrics in comparing forecast to actual results as well as in benchmarking to the Company's peer group.The Company's centralized manufacturing and support organizations, including global operations and certain administrative functions, provide support to its operating segments. Costs incurred by these organizations, as well as depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation expense are allocated to cost of goods sold as overhead. Consequently, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation expense are not independently identifiable components within the segment’s results, and, therefore are not provided.With the exception of goodwill, the Company does not identify assets by operating segment. Consequently, the CODM does not regularly review or receive discrete asset information by operating segment.The table below reconciles the Company's reportable segment to income before income taxes: Year EndedJune 29,2025June 30,2024June 25,2023(in thousands)Revenue$18,435,591 $14,905,386 $17,428,516 Installation and warranty expense544,192 435,015 647,612 Other cost of goods sold (COGS) (1)8,675,349 6,988,338 8,688,124 Segment COGS9,219,541 7,423,353 9,335,736 Segment gross margin9,216,050 7,482,033 8,092,780 Reconciliation to consolidated gross marginRestructuring charges, net— 43,375 78,166 All other COGS236,991 385,867 237,689 Gross margin8,979,059 7,052,791 7,776,925 Research and development2,096,387 1,902,444 1,727,162 Selling, general, and administrative981,704 868,247 832,753 Restructuring charges, net - operating expenses— 18,187 42,150 Other income (expense), net57,161 96,309 (65,650)Income before income taxes$5,958,129 $4,360,222 $5,109,210 (1)Other COGS is primarily comprised of the capitalized cost of inventory sold, including both direct and indirect costs, but excludes installation and warranty expense and those items not allocated to the segment.The Company operates in seven geographic regions: United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan.

For involuntary termination benefits that are not provided under the terms of an ongoing benefit arrangement, the liability for the current fair value of expected future costs associated with a management-approved restructuring plan is recognized in the period in which the plan is communicated to the employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory requirements, employee termination costs are accrued when the existing situation or set of circumstances indicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Termination benefits associated with employees that elected to voluntarily terminate as part of the restructuring plan are recorded when the employee irrevocably accepts the offer and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If applicable, the Company records such costs into operating expense over the terminated employees’ future service period beyond any minimum or legally required retention period. The majority of restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 65Table of ContentsDuring the fiscal year ended June 25, 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring plan designed to better align the Company’s cost structure with its outlook for the economic environment and business opportunities. Under the plan, through June 30, 2024, the Company terminated approximately 1,760 employees, incurring expenses related to employee severance and separation costs. Employee severance and separation costs are primarily related to severance, non-cash severance, including equity award compensation expense, pension and other termination benefits. Additionally, the Company made a strategic decision to relocate certain manufacturing activities to pre-existing facilities and incurred charges to move inventory and equipment and exit selected supplier arrangements.No restructuring costs were recorded during the fiscal year ended June 29, 2025. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, net restructuring costs of $43.4 million and $18.2 million were recorded in Restructuring charges, net - cost of goods sold, and Restructuring charges, net - operating expenses, respectively in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The restructuring plan was substantially completed as of June 30, 2024, and cumulative costs as of June 30, 2024 totaled $181.9 million. The restructuring liability reported as of June 30, 2024 totaling $1.1 million was substantially satisfied in the three months ended September 29, 2024.The following table is a summary of the activity related to the restructuring plan: Severance and BenefitsOtherTotal(in thousands)Restructuring liability as of June 25, 2023$7,989 $246 $8,235 Restructuring expense29,926 31,636 61,562 Cash payments(36,684)(24,045)(60,729)Non-cash activities(1,034)(6,941)(7,975)Restructuring liability as of June 30, 2024$197 $896 $1,093 Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 66Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lam Research CorporationOpinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation (the Company) as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated August 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 67Table of ContentsInventory - ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company’s inventories totaled $4.3 billion as of June 29, 2025, representing 20% of total assets. As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirement and obsolete inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost.Auditing management’s estimates for certain excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because management’s assessment of whether a write down is required and the measurement of any excess of cost over net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of qualitative factors that are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company’s control.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the Company’s processes and the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls addressing the identified audit risks. This included controls over management’s assessment of inventory valuation, including the development of forecasted usage of inventories and consideration of how factors outside of the Company’s control might affect management’s judgment related to the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions (e.g., forecasts related to the Company’s future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological obsolescence, and possible alternative uses) and the underlying data used in management’s excess and obsolete inventory valuation assessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to forecasted demand, historical sales and specific product considerations. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1981.San Jose, CaliforniaAugust 11, 2025Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 68Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lam Research CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lam Research Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated August 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaAugust 11, 2025Lam Research Corporation 2025 10-K 69Table of ContentsItem 9.     Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.     Controls and ProceduresDesign of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are designed to comply with Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the controls and procedures associated with each, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that the effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of June 29, 2025, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, along with our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of June 29, 2025, at the reasonable assurance level.We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could affect our business.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting”, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework used by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 29, 2025, at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, independently assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Form 10-K.Effectiveness of ControlsWhile we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level, future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B.        Other InformationRule 10b5-1 and Non-Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements During the Company’s fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2025, except for the following arrangements, none of the Company’s directors or officers adopted, modified, or terminated a trading arrangement for the purchase or sale of the Company’s common stock that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) (a “Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement”) or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K): •On June 11, 2025, Vahid Vahedi, the Senior Vice President, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer of the Company, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement.
