of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted, in accordance with the guidance set forth in Question 161.01 of the Compliance Disclosure
Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC.
Except
as described above, this Form 10-K/A does not modify or update the disclosure in, or exhibits to, the Original Form 10-K. Furthermore,
this Form 10-K/A does not change any previously reported financial results. Information not affected by this Form 10-K/A remains unchanged
and reflects the disclosures made at the time the Original Form 10-K was filed.

Family
Relationships
There
are no family relationships among our directors and executive officers.
Composition
of Our Board of Directors
Our
business and affairs are organized under the direction of our board of directors, which consists of four members, each of whom are elected
to serve for one year terms to hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders and
until a successor is appointed and qualified, or until their removal, resignation, or death. The primary responsibilities of our
board of directors are to provide oversight, strategic guidance, counselling, and direction to our management. Our board of directors
meets on a regular basis and additionally as required.
Director
Independence
Our
board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning
his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that three
of our four directors, each of Drs. Bae, Keyoung and Singhvi, are “independent” directors in accordance with the rules and
regulations of NYSE American.

the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:
●

offences);

The
Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight
The
board of directors oversees that the assets of our Company are properly safeguarded, that the appropriate financial and other controls
are maintained, and that our business is conducted wisely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance.
Included in these responsibilities is the board of directors’ oversight of the various risks facing our company. In this regard,
our board of directors seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks. Our board of directors does not view risk in isolation.
Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of our business strategy. Our board of directors recognizes that
it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our company
to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.
While
the board of directors oversees risk management, company management is charged with managing risk. Management communicates routinely
with the board of directors and individual directors on the significant risks identified and how they are being managed. Directors are
free to, and indeed often do, communicate directly with senior management.
Our
board of directors administers its risk oversight function as a whole by making risk oversight a matter of collective consideration;
however, much of the work is delegated to committees, which will meet regularly and report back to the full board of directors. We have
established a standing audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors.
The audit committee will oversee risks related to our financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting and legal matters,
the compensation committee will evaluate the risks and rewards associated with our compensation philosophy and programs, and the nominating
and corporate governance committee will evaluate risk associated with management decisions and strategic direction.
Committees
of Our Board of Directors
Our
board of directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee,
each of which is made up of independent directors. The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors
are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors.
Each committee has adopted a written charter that satisfies the application rules and regulation of the SEC and the NYSE American rules
and regulations, which have been posted to our website at https://kairospharma.com. Our board of directors may establish other committees
as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.
Audit
Committee
Our
audit committee consists of Dr. Michael Keyoung, Dr. Hyun W. Bae and Dr. Rahul Singhvi, each of whom our board of directors has determined
satisfies the independence requirements under the NYSE American rule and regulations and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. The chair
of our audit committee is Dr. Michael Keyoung, whom our board of directors has determined is an “audit committee financial expert”
within the meaning of SEC regulations. Each member of our audit committee can read and understand fundamental financial statements in
accordance with applicable requirements. In arriving at these determinations, the board of directors has examined each audit committee
member’s scope of experience and the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector.
4
The
primary purpose of the audit committee is to discharge the responsibilities of our board of directors with respect to our corporate accounting
and financial reporting processes, systems of internal control and financial-statement audits, and to oversee our independent registered
accounting firm. Specific responsibilities of our audit committee include:
●
helping
our board of directors oversee our corporate accounting and financial reporting processes;
●
managing
the selection, engagement, qualifications, independence and performance of a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered
public accounting firm to audit our financial statements;
●
discussing
the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewing, with management and the
independent accountants, our interim and year-end operating results;
●
developing
procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters;
●
reviewing
related person transactions;
●
obtaining
and reviewing a report by the independent registered public accounting firm at least annually, that describes our internal quality
control procedures, any material issues with such procedures, and any steps taken to deal with such issues when required by applicable
law; and
●
approving
or, as permitted, pre-approving, audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting
firm.
Compensation
Committee
Our
compensation committee consists of Dr. Singhvi, Dr. Keyoung and Dr. Bae. The chair of our compensation committee is Dr. Singhvi. Our
board of directors has determined that each member of our compensation committee is independent under the NYSE American rules and regulations
and as a “non-employee director” as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The
primary purpose of our compensation committee is to discharge the responsibilities of our board of directors in overseeing our compensation
policies, plans and programs, and to review and determine the compensation to be paid to our executive officers, directors and other
senior management, as appropriate. Specific responsibilities of our compensation committee include:
●
reviewing
and approving the compensation of our chief executive officer, other executive officers, and senior management;
●
reviewing
and recommending to our board of directors the compensation paid to our directors;
●
reviewing
and approving the compensation arrangements with our executive officers and other senior management;
●
administering
our equity incentive plans and other benefit programs;
●
reviewing,
adopting, amending, and terminating, incentive compensation and equity plans, severance agreements, profit sharing plans, bonus plans,
change-of-control protections, and any other compensatory arrangements for our executive officers and other senior management;
●
reviewing,
evaluating, and recommending to our board of directors’ succession plans for our executive officers; and
●
reviewing
and establishing general policies relating to compensation and benefits of our employees, including our overall compensation strategy,
including base salary, incentive compensation, and equity-based grants, to assure that it promotes stockholder interests and supports
our strategic and tactical objectives, and that it provides for appropriate rewards and incentives for our management and employees.
5
Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee
Our
nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Dr. Singhvi, Dr. Bae and Dr. Keyoung. The chair of our nominating and corporate
governance committee is Dr. Singhvi. Our board of directors has determined that each member of the nominating and corporate governance
committee is independent under the NYSE American rules and regulations, a non-employee director, and free from any relationship that
would interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment.
Specific
responsibilities of our nominating and corporate governance committee include:
●
identifying
and evaluating candidates, including the nomination of incumbent directors for reelection and nominees recommended by stockholders,
to serve on our board of directors;
●
considering
and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding the composition and chairmanship of the committees of our board of
directors;
●
instituting
plans or programs for the continuing education of our board of directors and orientation of new directors;
●
developing
and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding corporate governance guidelines and matters; and
●
overseeing
periodic evaluations of the board of directors’ performance, including committees of the board of directors and management.
Stockholders
of record may also nominate director candidates for our annual meetings of stockholders by following the procedures set forth in our
bylaws.
Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics
We
have adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all our employees, officers, and directors. This includes
our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions. The full text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been posted on our website at www.kairospharma.com. We intend
to disclose on our website any future amendments of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or waivers that exempt any principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, persons performing similar functions, or our directors
from provisions in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part
of this prospectus, and the inclusion of our website address in this prospectus is only an inactive textual reference.
Insider
Trading Policy
We
have adopted an insider trading policy which prohibits our directors, officers and employees from engaging in transactions in our common
stock while in the possession of material non-public information; engaging in transactions in the stock of other companies while in possession
of material non-public information that they become aware of in performing their duties; and disclosing material non-public information
to unauthorized persons outside our company.
Our
insider trading policy restricts trading by directors, officers and certain key employees during blackout periods, which generally begin
three weeks prior to the last day of each fiscal quarter and ending three business days following the date the Company’s financial
results are publicly disclosed and the Form 10-Q or the Form 10-K is filed. Additional blackout periods may be imposed with or without
notice, as the circumstances require.
6
In
addition, directors, officers and employees are expressly prohibited from making certain transactions, including short-term trading,
short sales, options trading, trading on margin, and hedging, unless such transaction is specifically approved in advance by the administrator
of our insider trading policy.
While
we have not adopted a formal policy governing insider trading restrictions on the Company itself, as a matter of practice the Company
observes the same procedures and restrictions, including the potential existence of material non-public information, with respect to
transactions by the Company in its securities, including repurchases of common stock.
Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None
of the members of the compensation committee is currently, or has been at any time, one of our executive officers or employees. None
of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last calendar year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation
committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee.
Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file
reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the SEC and to provide us with copies of those filings.
To
the Company’s knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations by
our officers and directors regarding their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements for our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders were met during the
year ended December 31, 2024, except for the following:

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis
This
Compensation Discussion and Analysis reviews the principles underlying our compensation policies and decisions for 2024.
Executive
Compensation Principles & Best Practices
What
We Do
What
We Do Not Do
●
Our Board has established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These committees include
an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Board of Directors has adopted
written charters for each of these committees.
●
We do not allow repricing of stock options without stockholder approval.
●
We do not provide change of control payments or gross-up of related excise taxes.
●
Dividend equivalents will not be paid unless vesting and performance conditions for Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), to which such
rights attach, are met.
●
We do not provide significant perquisites to our named executive officers.
Compensation
Philosophy
Our
compensation program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain highly talented executives, and to provide competitive compensation
opportunities that align management’s interests with the short- and long-term interests of our stockholders. Our incentive compensation
plans are designed with the objectives of motivating the desired performance and maximizing stockholder value. We believe that our compensation
program, supported by our underlying compensation philosophy, serves to motivate management to execute on the strategic and operational
plans that will deliver increases in stockholder value over the long-term.
The
forms and level of compensation for each named executive officer are determined after considering several factors, including the executive’s
position and scope of responsibility, as well as their ability to assume increasing responsibility within the Company, performance results,
and, at times, other external market-based factors. The Compensation Committee uses all of this information when establishing compensation
opportunities in order to arrive at a comprehensive package that both emphasizes performance and is competitive in the marketplace.
The
Compensation Committee reviews and considers this philosophy at least annually and may adjust it from time to time as deemed necessary
or appropriate.
Evaluation
of Stockholder “Say — on — Pay” Vote Results
We
value input from our stockholders on our executive compensation programs. Our Board seeks an annual non-binding advisory vote from stockholders
to approve our executive compensation. We believe our overall executive compensation program aligns with our philosophy and designed
to create long-term value for stockholders.
8
Roles
& Responsibilities in the Compensation Process
The
Company’s compensation philosophy drives our decision-making process. Decisions about individual levels of each compensation element
involve the participation of multiple parties, following a comprehensive, multi-step process. The key parties and their roles in the
process are described below:
Role
of the Compensation Committee
The
Compensation Committee is appointed by our Board to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by directing all significant
aspects of our compensation policies and programs, including:
●
Reviews
and approves the compensation and annual performance objectives, if any, and goals of our executive officers.
●
Reviews,
approves, and administers cash and equity incentive-based compensation plans in which our executive officers participate.
●
Evaluates
Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers performance in light of the Company’s goals and objectives and recommends
to the Board the salaries and short- and long-term incentives payouts for our Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers.
●
Evaluates
risks created by our compensation policies and practices and considers any reasonably likely effect of such risk.
●
Reviews
and recommends to our Board new or modified executive compensation programs (if any).
Role
of Management
We
did not pay any compensation to our executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and before we completed our IPO
in September 2024. Our Chief Executive Officer made recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the elements of compensation
for each of our executive officers. He was assisted, as needed, by other members of management, including our Chief Financial Officer
for purposes of administering and implementing the compensation program.
Compensation
Elements
Base
Salary
Base
salary is the fixed element of an executive officer’s annual compensation and is intended to attract and retain highly qualified
executives and to compensate for expected day-to-day performance. The Compensation Committee reviews the base salary for each of our
executive officers on an annual basis and considers the following factors in making its determinations:
●
the
executive officer’s position and associated responsibilities;
●
experience,
expertise, knowledge and qualifications;
●
market
factors;
●
the
industry in which we operate and compete;
●
retention
considerations;
●
the
executive officer’s individual compensation history;
●
internal
equity among salary levels of the members of our executive team and similarly situated/comparable executives in our peer group; and
●
our
overall compensation philosophy.
The
Company completed its IPO on September 16, 2024, after which time we commenced paying salaries to our executives. Prior to completion
of our IPO, none of our executive officers received any salary, thus no salaries were paid during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023. In 2024, base salaries of our named executive officers as of the calendar year end, which are reflective of the full salary that
would have been owed for a full year of employment, were as follows:

Long-Term
(Equity) Incentives (“LTIP”)
Long-term
equity incentives are designed to align the interests of management with those of our stockholders and motivating them to achieve sustained
long-term performance improvements by linking a significant portion of compensation to stockholder returns. The Company issues awards
of long-term equity and/or cash compensation under the LTIP consistent with the objectives and philosophy of our compensation programs.
Our LTIP is governed by the Kairos Pharma, Ltd. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders.
The
board of directors also may consider and approve interim or mid-year grants, or grants made on another basis, from time to time based
on business needs, changing compensation practices or other factors, at the discretion of the board of directors. The board of directors
does not consider material nonpublic information in determining the timing and terms of equity-based awards, and we have not timed the
disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Each
of our executive officers has received an initial grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), calculated on
the date of grant, which
vests annually in substantially equal installments over a period of three years. None of our executive officers
received any RSUs during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and before our IPO. The table below sets forth the RSUs received by
our executive officers as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

Equity-Based
Incentive Awards
In
July 2023, we adopted our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, which reserves 1,650,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2023 Equity
Incentive Plan. Our equity-based incentive awards granted under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan are designed to align our interests and
those of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants, including our executive officers. Our board of directors or an
authorized committee thereof is responsible for approving equity grants.
Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End
None
of our named officers had been granted options, or received any other type of equity compensation, during the fiscal years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023.
Emerging
Growth Company Status
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company we will be exempt from certain
requirements related to executive compensation, including the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
and to provide information relating to the ratio of total compensation of our chief executive officer to the median of the annual total
compensation of all of our employees, each as required by the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010, which is part of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Pension
Benefits
Our
named executive officers did not participate in, or otherwise receive any benefits under, any pension or retirement plan sponsored by
us during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation
Our
named executive officers did not participate in, or earn any benefits under, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan sponsored by
us during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Potential
Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control
Our
employment agreements with our executive officers include a termination clause which includes that, in the event of termination for a
good reason, including a change of control, the Company shall pay to the executive severance in an amount equal to the executive’s
then applicable base salary for a period equal to the number of months set forth in such executive’s employment agreement (the
“Severance Period”), payable in the form of salary continuation for the applicable Severance Period following the
executive’s termination, and subject to the Company’s regular payroll practices and required withholdings. Such severance
shall be reduced by any cash remuneration paid to the executive because of the executive’s employment or self-employment during
the Severance Period. The executive shall continue to receive all benefits (either through the Company or an Affiliate) during the Severance
Period. In addition to the above, our Chief Financial Officer will receive five years’ worth of RSU grants in the event of a change
of control.
Equity
Benefit Plans
We
believe that our ability to grant equity-based awards is a valuable and necessary compensation tool that aligns the long-term financial
interests of our employees, consultants, and directors with the financial interests of our stockholders. In addition, we believe that
our ability to grant options and other equity-based awards helps us to attract, retain, and motivate employees, consultants, and directors,
and encourages them to devote their best efforts to our business and financial success. As a result, we adopted the 2023 Equity Incentive
Plan in July 2023 in advance of our IPO. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan includes the features set forth below.
12
2023
Equity Incentive Plan
Tax
Limitations on Options. Each option will be designated in an award agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option (“ISO”)
or a Nonstatutory Stock Option (“NSO”). However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate fair
market value of the shares with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the participant during any calendar year
exceeds $100,000, such options will be treated as NSOs. The fair market value of the shares will be determined as of the time the option
with respect to such shares is granted. The administrator will determine the term of each option in its sole discretion; provided, however,
that the term will be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant in the case of ISOs. Moreover, in the event an ISO is granted
to a participant who, at the time of grant, owns stock representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company, the term of the ISO will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
award agreement.
Restricted
Stock Unit Awards. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined
by the administrator of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. Each RSU grant will be evidenced by an award agreement that will specify such
other terms and conditions as the administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or
be removed, subject to the prohibition on acceleration of the timing of distribution of deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code, to the extent applicable to the award. On the date set forth in the award agreement, all unearned RSUs will be forfeited
to the Company.
Restricted
Stock Awards. Each restricted stock award will be evidenced by an award agreement that will specify the period of restriction,
the number of shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the administrator will determine. During the period of restriction,
service providers holding shares of restricted stocks granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares,
unless the administrator determines otherwise in a manner not prohibited by the award agreement. During the period of restriction, service
providers holding shares of restricted stocks will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to
such shares unless otherwise provided in the award agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares, the shares will
be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and provisions for forfeiture as the shares of restricted stocks with respect
to which they were paid. On the date set forth in the award agreement, the restricted stocks for which restrictions have not lapsed will
revert to the Company and again will become available for grant under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan.
Stock
Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights will be granted in accordance with stock appreciation rights agreements, in the
form adopted by the administrator. The exercise price of stock appreciation rights will be not less than 100% of the fair market value
of a share on the date of grant. Each stock appreciation right grant will be evidenced by an award agreement that will specify the exercise
price, the number of shares with respect to which the award is granted, the term of the stock appreciation right, the conditions of exercise,
and such other terms and conditions as the administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. Stock appreciation right granted under
the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan will expire upon the date determined by the administrator and set forth in the award agreement; provided,
however, that the term will be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right,
a participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the difference between
the fair market value of a share on the date of exercise over the “stock appreciation right exercise price,” as defined under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(i)(B)(2), i.e., the fair market value of a share on the date of grant of the stock appreciation
right; times (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. At the discretion of the administrator,
the payment upon stock appreciation right exercise may be in cash, in shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.
13
Performance
Awards. Performance units and performance shares may be granted to service providers at any time and from time to time, as will
be determined by the administrator, in its sole discretion. Each performance unit will have an initial value that is established by the
administrator on or before the date of grant. Each performance share will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of a share
on the date of grant. The administrator will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions. The administrator may set vesting
criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment),
or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. Each award of performance units/shares will be evidenced by an
award agreement that will specify the performance period, and such other terms and conditions as the administrator, in its sole discretion,
will determine. After the applicable performance period has ended, the holder of performance units/shares will be entitled to receive
a payout of the number of performance units/shares earned by the participant over the performance period, to be determined as a function
of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved. Payment of earned performance
units/shares will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable performance period or, if earlier, after the
date on which a participant’s interest in such performance units/shares is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,
provided however, that in no event shall such payment be made after the later to occur of (i) December 31 of the year in which such risk
of forfeiture lapses or (ii) two and one-half months after such risk of forfeiture lapses. The administrator, in its sole discretion,
may pay earned performance units/shares in the form of cash, in shares (which have an aggregate fair market value equal to the value
of the earned performance units/shares at the close of the applicable performance period) or in a combination thereof. On the date set
forth in the award agreement, all unearned or unvested performance units/shares will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available
for grant under the Plan.
Other
Stock Awards. The administrator may grant other awards based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock. The administrator
will set the number of shares under the stock award (or cash equivalent) and all other terms and conditions of such awards.
Adjustments.
In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares, other securities, or other property),
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase,
or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the shares
occurs, the administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available
under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2023 Equity Incentive
Plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth thereof.
Dissolution
or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any corporate separation or division,
including, but not limited to, a split-up, a split-off or a spin-off; a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving entity,
but the shares of Company stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property,
whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise; or the transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding voting
stock of the Company to another person or entity, the administrator will notify each participant as soon as practicable prior to the
effective date of such proposed transaction. The Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law but otherwise in its sole discretion
may provide for: (i) the continuation awards by the Company (if the Company is surviving entity or its parent; (ii) the assumption of
the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and such outstanding awards by the surviving entity or its parent; (iii) the substitution by the surviving
entity or its parent of rights with substantially the same terms for such outstanding awards; or (iv) the cancellation of such outstanding
rights without payment of any consideration provided that in the case of this clause (iv), the administrator will provide notice of its
intention to cancel award and offer a reasonable opportunity to exercise vested awards.
Change
in Control. In the event of a merger or change in control, as defined in the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, each outstanding award
will be treated as the administrator determines, including, without limitation, that each award will be assumed or an equivalent option
or right substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. The administrator will not
be required to treat all awards similarly in the transaction.
Plan
Amendment or Termination. The administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend, or terminate the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan.
The Company will obtain stockholder approval to any amendment to the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan to the extent necessary or desirable
to comply with applicable rules and regulations. No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan
will impair the rights of any participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the participant and the administrator, which agreement
must be in writing and signed by the participant and the Company. Termination of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan will not affect the administrator’s
ability to exercise the powers granted to it thereunder with respect to awards granted under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan prior to
the date of such termination.
14
Clawback
Policy
As
a public company, if we are required to restate our financial results due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting
requirements under the federal securities laws as a result of misconduct, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may
be legally required to reimburse our Company for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they receive in accordance
with the provisions of section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. As such, on March 1, 2024 we adopted a clawback policy,
entitled, “Policy for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation.”
Non-Employee
Director Compensation
Compensation
for non-employee directors is determined by the board of directors. Each non-employee director receives an annual cash compensation of
$50,000, payable in quarterly instalments in arrears, plus an additional $10,000 cash compensation for the chair of the audit committee.
In addition, our policy provides that, upon initial election or appointment to our board of directors, each new non-employee director
will be granted a one-time grant, or Director Initial Grant, of $50,000 of RSUs, with the number of RSUs issued calculated as of the
grant date, which will vest in substantially equal annual instalments over a period of three years. The Director Initial Grant is subject
to full acceleration of vesting upon the sale of our Company, in accordance with the terms of our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. Employee
directors receive no additional compensation for their service as a director.
We
reimburse our directors for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred for their attendance at meetings of our board of directors
or any committee thereof.
Our
current non-employee directors earned the following compensation for their service during fiscal year ended December 31, 2024:

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The
following includes a summary of transactions since January 1, 2021 to which we have been a party in which the amount involved exceeded
or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 as of December 31, 2024, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or, to our knowledge,
beneficial owners of more than 5% of our capital stock or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will
have a direct or indirect material interest, other than equity and other compensation, termination, change in control and other arrangements,
which are described under “Executive Compensation.” We also describe below certain other transactions with our directors,
executive officers and stockholders.
Loans
and Advances from Related Parties
In
August 2024, the Company borrowed $0.04 million from one of its officers. The loans accrue interest at 7.5% interest per annum, are unsecured,
and are due in August 2025.
In
April and May 2024, the Company borrowed $0.1 million from three of its officers. The loans accrue interest at 7.5% per annum, are unsecured,
and are due in April 2025. The officers holding notes payable have since agreed to convert the outstanding loans and principal into shares
of common stock of the company, converting at the IPO per share purchase price, following completion of the IPO.
During
the year ended December 31, 2021, stockholders of the Company, and a company whose principal stockholder is also a stockholder of the
Company, advanced the Company $0.01 million, which was all outstanding at December 31, 2021. The advances accrue no interest, are unsecured
and are due on demand. As of December 31, 2021, $0.01 million was owed on the advances. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Company repaid $0.01 million of the advances, and as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and June 30, 2024, a total of $0.004 was outstanding.
Policies
and Procedures for Transactions with Related Persons
Any
request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, nominee for election as a director, beneficial owner
of more than 5% of any class of our common stock, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, in which the
amount involved exceeds $120,000 (or, if less, 1% of the average of our total assets in a fiscal year) and such person would have a direct
or indirect interest, must be presented to our board of directors or our audit committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving
or rejecting any such proposal, our board of directors or our audit committee is to consider the material facts of the transaction, including
whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or
similar circumstances and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction.
Board
Independence
As
required under the listing standards of the NYSE American, a majority of the members of a listed company’s board must qualify
as “independent director,” as affirmatively determined by the Company’s board of directors. NYSE American defines
an “independent director” as a director who is not an executive officer or employee of the company and who does not
otherwise have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out a director’s
responsibilities. We presently maintain a four person board, led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. John Yu, with
three independent directors. Our board has determined that the following directors are considered independent under Nasdaq rules and
SEC regulations: Dr. Hyun W. Bae, Dr. Hansoo Michael Keyoung and Dr. Rahul Singhvi.
ANNUAL
REPORT
On
April 15, 2025, we filed with the SEC our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequently filed an Amendment
No. 1 to Form 10-K (the “10-K/A”) solely to update the exhibits in the Form 10-K/A to include Exhibit 97.1, the company’s
recovery policy for erroneously awarded equity compensation. A copy of the Annual Report has been made available with this proxy statement
to all stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting.

Audit fees consist of fees

filed in 2024 and 2023. Audit fees also include fees related to the reviews of interim financial information included in Forms 10-Q
and for consent or comfort letter procedures performed in conjunction with registration statements or completing financial transactions
during the respective fiscal years.
Audit
Committee Pre-approval Policies and Procedures
Our
policy has been for the Audit Committee to pre-approve all audit, audit-related and non-audit services performed by our independent auditors
and to subsequently review the actual fees and expenses paid to our independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committee pre-approved
all audit, audit-related and non-audit services performed by our independent auditors and subsequently reviewed the actual fees and expenses
paid to our former auditor, Marcum LLP, during fiscal 2023 and 2024. The Audit Committee has determined that the fees paid to Marcum
LLP for services were compatible with maintaining Marcum LLP’s independence as our auditors.
