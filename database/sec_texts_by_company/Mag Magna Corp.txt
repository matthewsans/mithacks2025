RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended April 30, 2025 compared to April
30, 2024
Revenues
During the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we
have generated total revenue of $49,905 and $5,600, respectively. For the year ended April 30, 2025, the revenue was received from the
sale of consulting services and API requests. For the year ended April 30, 2024, the revenue was received from the sale of consulting

The reason for the increase in sales for the year

Total operating expenses for the year ended April
30, 2025 were $102,161 compared to $56,475 for the year ended April 30, 2024. Expenses increased in the year ended April 30, 2025 primarily
due to the consulting services, marketing services, SEO services, professional fees and server expense. Professional fees primarily increased
due to legal and audit fees. Server expense increased due to the fact that the server was rented in February 2024.

Total other income for the years ended April 30, 2025
and 2024 was $2 and $22, respectively. The other income included interest income.
Net Losses

$52,254, compared to $50,853 for the year ended April 30, 2024, due to the factors discussed above.

as of April 30, 2025, compared to $68,770 as of April 30, 2024, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.
During the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company

the year ended April 30, 2024, were $107,971 due to net proceeds from the related party loan ($74,745) and share

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments
and Estimates
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The core principle of
ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that
core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate the transaction price. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company generates revenue primarily from two sources:
(1) providing Poultry Farming Consultancy services, and (2) sales of subscription plans for its API service.
(1) The revenue for our Poultry Farming Consultancy
is acknowledged at a specific moment when the consulting services are completed and delivered in accordance with contractual terms. The
company assumes no responsibility for any inability to fulfill obligations arising from circumstances beyond reasonable control. Our liability
is restricted to the cumulative sum of payments made by the customer for services specified in the invoice. We may request deposits from
clients before delivering services upon order placement. If deposits are obtained
8
before providing services, the consultancy acknowledges
deferred revenue until the service delivery is completed. Payment is typically received prior to the delivery of materials. During the
year ended April 30, 2025, we have generated revenue from the providing of our Poultry Farming Consultancy services in the amount
of $23,726. The services were provided by the Company’s CEO.
(2) The Subscription Plan for API service is provided
on the basis of the amount of requests per month. The service covers a variety of 12 common chicken breeds. It provides users with an
access to a comprehensive database that includes detailed information on symptoms, potential causes, and effective management strategies
for each breed-specific condition. To access Poultry Wellness Guide API, a subscription purchase is required. Subscriptions must comply
with our Terms of Service. Subscription revenue for the API service is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscription payments
are received in advance of the service period. Such advance payments are recorded as deferred income upon receipt and are recognized as
revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period the service is provided, reflecting the transfer of control and continuous
delivery of the service to the customer. During the year ended April 30, 2025, we have generated revenue from the sale of API requests
in the amount of $26,179.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of April 30, 2025, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Limited Operating History and Need for Additional
Capital
There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
We have no assurance that future financing will be
available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand
our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Mag Magna Corp
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mag Magna Corp as of
April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for
the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mag Magna Corp as of April 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has an accumulated deficit
and uses net cash for their operating activities and operates at a net loss, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent
with respect to Mag Magna Corp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mag Magna Corp is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
11
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

MAG MAGNA CORP
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2025 and 2024
1. THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Mag Magna Corp (“the Company”) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Wyoming, U.S. on September 20, 2021 (Incorporation). The Company's primary focus lies in assisting and
consulting businesses engaged in poultry farming. The corporation's purpose is to introduce and promote alternative methods of raising
chickens without the use of antibiotics.
The Company has elected April 30th as its fiscal year-end.
2. GOING CONCERN
Our financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We have an accumulated deficit of $121,024 as
of April 30, 2025, had a net loss of $52,254, and used net cash of $61,558 in
operating activities for the year ended April 30, 2025. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Our management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and public issuance of common
stock. While we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing and generating revenue to fund our operations,
meet regulatory requirements, and achieve commercial goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and
that we will succeed in our future operations.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and
accounting principles. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Revenue
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The core principle of
ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that
core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate the transaction price. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
17
MAG MAGNA CORP
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2025 and 2024
The Company generates revenue primarily from two sources:
(1) providing Poultry Farming Consultancy services, and (2) sales of subscription plans for its API service.
(1) The revenue for our Poultry Farming Consultancy
is acknowledged at a specific moment when the consulting services are completed and delivered in accordance with contractual terms. The
Company assumes no responsibility for any inability to fulfill obligations arising from circumstances beyond reasonable control. We may
request deposits from clients before delivering services upon order placement. If deposits are obtained before providing services, the
Company acknowledges deferred revenue until the service delivery is completed. Payment is typically received prior to the service delivery.
During the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we have generated revenue from the providing of our Poultry Farming Consultancy services
in the amount of $23,726 and $5,600, respectively. The deferred income related to the providing Poultry Farming Consultancy services was
$0 as of April 30, 2025 and 2024. The services were provided by the Company’s CEO.
(2) The Subscription Plan for API service is provided
on the basis of the amount of requests per month. The service covers a variety of 12 common chicken breeds. It provides users with an
access to a comprehensive database that includes detailed information on symptoms, potential causes, and effective management strategies
for each breed-specific condition. To access Poultry Wellness Guide API, a subscription purchase is required. Subscriptions must comply
with our Terms of Service. Subscription revenue for the API service is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscription payments
are received in advance of the service period. Such advance payments are recorded as deferred income upon receipt and are recognized as
revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period the service is provided, reflecting the transfer of control and continuous
delivery of the service to the customer. During the year ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, we have generated revenue from the sale of
API requests in the amount of $26,179 and $0, respectively. The deferred income related to the sales of subscription plans for the API
service was $5,272 and $0 as of April 30, 2025 and 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables
Receivables are carried at net realizable value, representing
the outstanding balance less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts. Management determines the
allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual receivables, and receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible.
Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. We had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0 as of April
30, 2025 and 2024.
Advertising
The Company recognizes advertising costs in accordance
with ASC 720-35, Advertising Costs (“ASC 720-35”), which requires that all advertising costs be expensed as incurred. Advertising
expense amounted to approximately $10,150 and $0 for the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Advertising costs, which have
been paid for but that have not been received, were $7,250 and $0 as of April 30, 2025 and 2024.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2025 and 2024
Foreign Currency
The Company’s functional and reporting currency
is the U.S. dollar. Transactions may occur in foreign currencies, and management has adopted ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Translation Matters”.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the
date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation
or settlement of foreign currency-denominated transactions or balances are included in the statement.
Intangible Asset
The Company accounts for its intangible assets in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-40, “Internal-Use Software-Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use”, and
ASC Subtopic 360-10, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. ASC Subtopic 350-40 requires assets
to be recorded at the cost to develop the asset and requires an intangible asset to be amortized over its useful life and for the useful
life to be evaluated every reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of
amortization. If the estimate of useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively
over the revised remaining useful life.
Intangible assets
were made up of the following at each balance sheet date:

MAG MAGNA CORP
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2025 and 2024
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events and changes
in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs
into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
These tiers include:
Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets;
Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices
in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little
or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
Financial instruments consist of the Company’s
current assets, accounts payable and amounts due to a related party. The recorded values of all financial instruments approximate their
current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in
accordance with ASC 260-10-45 “Earnings per Share”, which requires the presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per
share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential
common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings
(loss) per share are equal.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Financial Statement Reclassification
Certain account balances from prior periods have been
reclassified in these condensed financial statements to conform to current period classifications.
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2025
In November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting
Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” which expanded
annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.
The amendments do not change how segments are determined or aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments.
We adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended April 30, 2025. See Note 4 "Operating Segments" in the accompanying notes to the
financial statements for further detail.
No other recently issued guidance adopted in Fiscal
2025 had a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption or is expected to have a material impact in future periods.
NOTE 4 – OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Company operates as a single operating segment,
focusing on the introduction and promotion of alternative methods of raising chickens without the use of antibiotics.
The accounting policies of the operating segment are
the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses performance for the segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income
(loss) that is reported on the income statement. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets.
5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As of April 30, 2025, the former director of the Company,
Oleg Bilinski, advanced $221,927 to the Company. During the year ended April 30, 2025, Oleg Bilinski advanced to the Company $170,707
for the Company's operating expenses and $54,149 was repaid to the former Director. During the year ended April 30, 2024, Oleg Bilinski
advanced to the Company $126,348 for the Company's operating expenses and $51,603 was repaid to the former Director. This loan is for
up to $250,000, unsecured, interest-free, with no fixed payment term, for working capital purposes. The note is non-interest bearing and
is due on demand.
6. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Upon formation, the total number of shares of all
classes of stock which the Company is authorized to issue is Seventy-Five Million (75,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value of $0.001
per share.
On November 26, 2021 the Company issued 4,500,000
shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share to the former director of the Company, Oleg Bilinski, for total proceeds of $4,500.
During year
ended April 30, 2024 the Company issued 1,329,047 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $33,226 at $0.025 per share.

MAG MAGNA CORP
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2025 and 2024
There were 5,829,047 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding as of April 30, 2025 and 2024.
7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
During the normal course of business, the Company
may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation, it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 450-20-50, “Contingencies”. The Company evaluates
its exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines
that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes the necessary accruals. As of April 30, 2025,
the Company is not aware of any contingent liabilities that should be reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
8. INCOME TAXES
The Company has no tax position at April 30, 2025
for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such
interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at April 30,
2025. The Company’s utilization of any net operating loss carryforward may be unlikely as a result of its intended activities.
The valuation allowance at April 30, 2025 was $25,415.
The net change in valuation allowance from April 30, 2024 to April 30, 2025 was $10,973. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on consideration of these items, management
has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application
of a full valuation allowance as of April 30, 2025 and 2024. All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities
of US Federal and state of Wyoming.
The components of the Company’s deferred tax
asset computed at the federal statutory rate of 21% is as follows:

use in future years.
9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In accordance with ASC 855, “Subsequent Events”,
the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to April 30, 2025, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent
events to disclose in these financial statements other than the event listed below.
Subsequent to April 30, 2025, the Company’s
former CEO, Oleg Bilinski, advanced an additional approximately $14,351 on behalf of the Company. These funds were advanced under the
Loan Payable – Related Party – See Note 5. In addition, on June 4, 2025, the former President and CEO, Oleg Bilinski, forgave
his loan to the Company totaling $236,278. As a result, as of the filing date of this 10-K, the Company's loan balance to the former President
and CEO was $0.
On June 4, 2025, there occurred a change in control
of Mag Magna Corp, a Wyoming corporation (the “Company”). On such date, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the “Change-in-Control
Agreement”), Wang Gang acquired 4,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Control Shares”) from Oleg
Bilinski. The Control Shares represent approximately 77.20% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock and constitute
voting control of the Company. The total consideration paid by Mr. Wang for the Control Shares was $564,380.50 in cash. Additionally,
effective June 4, 2025, Mr. Wang acquired an additional 142,372 shares of the Company’s common stock from 18 Company shareholders
for a total of $17,846.50 in cash, pursuant to separate stock purchase agreements.
In conjunction with the Change-in-Control Agreements,
on June 4, 2025, Oleg Bilinki resigned as President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Company, Tomasz
Anczok resigned as a Director of the Company and Wang Gang was appointed as the Sole Director, President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer
and Secretary of the Company.
Certain information regarding the background of Mr.
Wang is set forth below.
Wang Gang, 36, has, since 2024, served as Manager
at Yilong Energy Holding Co., Ltd., where his duties include market expansion initiatives in the energy sector, analysis of industry trends
and competitor strategies, coordinating with technical and sales teams and negotiating contracts with key suppliers. From 2021 to 2024,
Mr. Wang served as a
23

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Management’s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer at the time, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, using the criteria established in
“Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”)
in 2013.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.
1.The Company does not have an adequate internal control structure or adequate oversight over financial
reporting – The Company has only one member of management whom is also the Company’s sole director, therefore the Company
lacks adequate segregation of duties. Further, the Company currently has no Audit Committee. While not being legally obligated to have
an audit committee, it is management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity
level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee,
and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s
activities. Lastly, due to the minimal operations and small size of the Company we have not employed individuals that have the necessary
accounting knowledge and expertise to ensure accurate financial reporting under US GAAP.
2.The Company lacks appropriate information technology controls - As of April 30, 2025, the Company retains
copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s
data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.
Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control
deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.
As a result of the material weaknesses described above,
management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2025, based
on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO in 2013.
25
System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
