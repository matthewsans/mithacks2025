(the “Company”) for the year ended March 31, 2025, originally filed on June 4, 2025 (the “Original Report”). We are filing this Amended Report for the sole purpose of filing the information required by Part III of Form 10-K. We previously omitted this information from the Original Report in reliance on General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K, which permits this information to be incorporated by reference from a registrant’s definitive proxy statement if the proxy statement is filed within 120 days after fiscal year-end. We are filing this Amended Report to include Part III information in our Original Report because we do not intend to file a definitive proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders containing such information within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. The reference on the cover page of the Original Report to such incorporation by reference has been deleted, and this Amended Report amends and restates in their entirety the cover page and Part III of the Original Report. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in Part III of this Amended Report shall have the same meanings assigned to those terms in Parts I and II of the Original Report.Pursuant to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), Part IV, Item 15 (Exhibit Index) has also been amended to contain the currently dated certifications from our principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The certifications of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer are attached to this Amended Report as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 31.3, respectively. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amended Report and this Amended Report does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, we have omitted paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications filed with this Amended Report. Additionally, we are not including the certifications under Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, because we are not filing any financial statements with this Amended Report.The remainder of the Original Report remains the same as previously reported in the Original Report, and there are no other changes to the Company’s financial statements or disclosures and there are no changes to the Company’s reported results. This Amended Report does not reflect any subsequent events occurring after the filing date of the Original Report and does not modify or update in any way the disclosures made in the Original Report except as described above. Accordingly, this Amended Report should be read in conjunction with the Original Report and with our filings with the SEC after the Original Report.Table of ContentsTABLE OF CONTENTSPart III. 1Item 10.

Specific responsibilities of our Compensation Committee include: •reviewing and recommending policies relating to compensation and benefits of our officers and employees, including reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers; •evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers in light of those goals and objectives;•reviewing annually and recommending to the Board for approval of all compensation to be paid or awarded to the Chief Executive Officer; •developing and implementing policies with respect to the recovery of excess compensation paid to any executive officers based on erroneous data; •administering the issuance of options and other awards under our equity-based incentive plans; •reviewing and approving, for the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers, employment agreements, severance agreements, consulting agreements and change in control or termination agreements;•reviewing our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on diversity and inclusion with respect to our leadership and workforce; and 2Table of Contents•such other matters that are specifically designated to the Compensation Committee by our Board from time to time.

The Board has determined that each of the members of the Corporate Governance Committee satisfies the independence requirements of the NYSE.Ms. Dodson serves as the chair of the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of the stockholders. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Board expects to consider educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. The Board will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by its stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to the Board should follow the procedures set forth in our charter and bylaws. Specific responsibilities of our Corporate Governance Committee include: •identifying and evaluating candidates, including the nomination of incumbent directors for reelection and nominees recommended by stockholders, to serve on our Board; •considering and making recommendations to our Board regarding changes to the size and composition of our Board; •considering and making recommendations to our Board regarding the composition and chairmanship of the committees of our Board; •providing oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on environmental and social responsibility and risks;•establishing procedures to exercise oversight of, and oversee the performance evaluation process of, management; •overseeing periodic evaluations of the performance of our Board and its committees; •instituting plans or programs for the continuing education of our Board and orientation of new directors; •developing and making recommendations to our Board regarding corporate governance guidelines and matters; and •such other matters that are specifically designated to the Corporate Governance Committee by our Board from time to time. In the process of identifying, screening and recommending director candidates to the full Board, our Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration the needs of the Board and the qualifications of the candidates, such as their general understanding of various business disciplines and our business environment, their educational and professional background, analytical ability, independence, diversity of experience and viewpoints, and their willingness to devote adequate time to board duties. The Board evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole with the objective of retaining a group that is best equipped to help ensure that the long-term interests of the stockholders are served. When searching for new directors, the Corporate Governance Committee will actively seek out women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which nominees for the Board are 3Table of Contentschosen. The Corporate Governance Committee may engage consultants or third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders on the same basis that it evaluates other nominees for director. In doing so, the Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate director candidates in light of several factors, including the general criteria outlined above. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors at the applicable meeting of stockholders may nominate persons for election to our Board, if such stockholder complies with the applicable notice procedures, which are set forth in our bylaws.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATIONCompensation Discussion and AnalysisThe following Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) describes our compensation program for the fiscal year 2025 relating to our named executive officers (“NEOs”):•Matt Meeker, Chief Executive Officer•Zahir Ibrahim, Chief Financial Officer•Allison Koehler, Chief Legal OfficerElements of our Executive Compensation ProgramOur executive compensation program has continued to evolve to align with our status as a more mature, publicly-traded company, while still supporting our overall business and compensation objectives. For fiscal year 2025, the principal elements of the compensation program for our NEOs were base salary and incentive compensation delivered in the form of an annual incentive opportunity and long-term incentives comprised of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and, in the case of Mr. Meeker, performance stock units (“PSUs”). Compensation Decisions for Fiscal Year 2025Base SalaryBase salary for two of our NEOs was increased for fiscal year 2025 based on a review of competitive market data and to continue to bring their base salary levels more in line with peer group data, as described further below. The increase in Mr. Meeker’s base salary also reflects the fact that Mr. Meeker voluntarily accepted no increase in base salary for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, resulting in a larger market adjustment for fiscal year 2025. The following table sets forth the base salaries for our NEOs for fiscal year 2025:Named Executive OfficerBase Salary FY ‘24Base Salary FY ‘25Matt Meeker$525,000$700,000Zahir Ibrahim$550,000$600,000Allison Koehler$375,000$375,000Annual Incentives Under the fiscal year 2025 annual incentive program, the Compensation Committee established net revenue and adjusted EBITDA as the performance measures for determining payouts in order to focus management on our path to profitability. The performance measures were weighted at 60% for net revenue and 40% for adjusted EBITDA. The following table sets forth the goals for fiscal year 2025:Performance GoalsNet Revenue Adjusted EBITDAThreshold$480,000,000$0Target$500,000,000$4,000,000Maximum$550,000,000$8,000,000For purposes of the annual incentive program, adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) depreciation and amortization expense, (4) stock-based compensation expense, (5) change in fair value of warrants and derivatives, (6) sales and use tax (income) expense, (7) restructuring charges related to reduction in force payments, (8) (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, (9) duplicate rent expense incurred during the relocation of our corporate headquarters, (10) impairment of assets, (11) transaction costs (12) demurrage fees related to freight, (13) technology transformation and (14) other items comprised of non-recurring retention payments to management, executive transition costs, warehouse restructuring costs, and legal settlements.
For fiscal year 2025, the Compensation Committee established the following incentive opportunities, as a percentage of base salary, for each of the NEOs based on a comparison with the competitive market. Ms. Koehler’s target incentive was increased from 40% in fiscal year 2024 to 50% in fiscal year 2025 to further align her overall compensation with the competitive market. As noted above, the payout amounts for the various performance targets were set as follows: 50% payout for threshold performance; 100% payout for target performance; and 200% payout for performance at or above the maximum performance level. The threshold for a performance measure must be met for a payout for that performance measure under our annual incentive program.

Consistent with our fiscal year 2024 program design and to further align our NEOs interests with our stockholders, payouts under the annual 8Table of Contentsincentive opportunity were comprised of 80% cash and 20% equity in the form of immediately vested and unrestricted shares of the Company. The payouts were:Named Executive OfficerPayoutMatt Meeker$595,700Zahir Ibrahim$382,950Allison Koehler$159,563Other BonusesIn fiscal year 2025, Ms. Koehler received a cash bonus in the amount of $228,750 in lieu of a portion of her fiscal year 2025 long-term incentives. This bonus was made to recognize Ms. Koehler’s strong performance and to further align her overall compensation with the competitive market as well as the Company’s other executive officers.Long-term IncentivesThe following table sets forth the grant date fair value of awards of RSUs and PSUs, computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), granted to our NEOs in fiscal year 2025. We did not grant any of our NEOs stock options during fiscal year 2025. The grant levels were determined based on the competitive market and our historical compensation practices and the retentive value of outstanding equity awards held by each NEO. Mr. Meeker’s long-term incentives were increased as compared to fiscal year 2024 to further align his overall compensation with the competitive market and to reflect the introduction of PSUs, which further increased the portion of his compensation that is tied to the achievement of pre-established performance goals. Each of the NEOs received an equity grant in fiscal 2025 as follows: Named Executive OfficerRSUs($)(1)PSUs($)(2)Matt Meeker$1,057,419$1,057,419Zahir Ibrahim$612,000—Allison Koehler$228,750—(1) These RSUs will vest 25% on August 10, 2025, and then in substantially equal quarterly amounts over the remaining three years, except Ms. Koehler’s grant which vests is substantially equal quarterly amounts over two years beginning on August 10, 2026.(2) These PSUs will vest upon the attainment of the net revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance goals in fiscal year 2027, subject to Mr. Meeker’s continued employment through fiscal year 2027, with the vesting level ranging from 0% to 200% based on performance. The goals were established based on our long-term operating plan and were designed to be challenging but achievable with strong management performance.Other Benefits and Perquisites We provide benefits to our NEOs on the same basis as provided to all of our employees, including health, dental and vision insurance, pet insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, and a matching contribution under our Section 401(k) retirement plan. Our Compensation Process Role of the Compensation CommitteeThe Compensation Committee meets regularly with management, and in executive session without members of management present, to make decisions regarding our executive compensation programs and the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other executives. In making executive compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews a variety of market data and information, including peer group and relevant industry information. The Chair of the Compensation Committee regularly reports on the committee’s actions to our Board. The Compensation Committee’s responsibilities include the following:•reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the director compensation program and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;•reviewing the succession process for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers;•approving overall compensation strategy;•approving amounts and forms of executive compensation;•approving goals and objectives to be considered in determining the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers;•reviewing and approving annual and long-term incentive plans and benefit plans;•reviewing and approving equity grants to employees; and•approving on an annual basis, the compensation peer group.Our Compensation Philosophy9Table of ContentsOur compensation practices consist of the following, each of which the Compensation Committee believes reinforces our compensation objectives:Checklist of Compensation Practices✔Rigorous target setting process for incentive metrics to align pay outcomes with performance❌We do not have excessive severance benefits✔Double-trigger vesting for equity awards in the event of a change in control❌No hedging or short sales and no pledging of our securities except in limited circumstances with approval✔Provide no executive-specific perquisites other than limited relocation benefits❌No tax gross ups related to change in control✔Regularly assess the risk-reward balance of our compensation programs in order to mitigate riskCompensation is a key driver of attraction, engagement, and retention of employees at all levels and represents one of our largest controllable expenses.

During fiscal year 2025, Willis Towers Watson provided advice to the Company and the Compensation Committee with respect to the following:•current trends and best practices in compensation design and program alternatives;•providing and discussing peer group and survey data for competitive comparisons and, based on this information, offering recommendations on NEO compensation, including the Chief Executive Officer;•offering recommendations, insights and perspectives on compensation-related matters; and •assisting in designing executive compensation programs designed to be competitive and to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.Other than the executive compensation advisory services provided to management and the Compensation Committee, Willis Towers Watson did not provide any services to the Company with respect to fiscal year 2025. Role of ManagementOur Chief Executive Officer is present at Compensation Committee meetings, except when the Compensation Committee is in executive session or when his own compensation is being discussed. With regard to executive compensation, our Chief Executive Officer provides his evaluation of each executive’s compensation to the Compensation Committee and makes recommendations with respect to base salary, annual incentives, and long-term equity incentives for each of his direct reports. These recommendations are made after considering the peer group, other relevant data, and each executive’s responsibilities and performance and his or her impact to the organization. This recommendation is considered by the Compensation Committee, which then makes its own decision regarding the compensation for each NEO.10Table of ContentsOur Peer GroupThe Compensation Committee established a compensation peer group (the “Peer Group”) to be used in determining market competitiveness of our compensation programs.

We believe the benefits provided under the Severance and Change in Control Agreements are necessary to meet our objectives to:•attract and retain top executive talent; •ensure our executives remain objective and dedicated to the Company’s strategic objectives; and •facilitate a smooth transition should a change in control occur.ComponentChange in Control Termination Event(1)Salary BenefitTwelve (12) months salary continuationBonusTarget annual incentive bonusEquityFull vesting accelerationHealth BenefitsCOBRA subsidy equal to duration of salary benefit(1) The change in control benefits are subject to a double trigger, meaning that both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment must occur during three months prior to or within twelve months following such change in control. A qualifying termination of employment under the Severance and Change in Control Agreements means termination by the Company without cause or by the executive due to good reason.ComponentSeveranceSalary BenefitSix (6) months salary continuationBonusNoneEquitySix (6) months vesting accelerationHealth BenefitsCOBRA subsidy equal to duration of salary benefitMr. Meeker is not a party to a Severance and Change in Control Agreement and does not have any agreement in place entitling him to cash severance benefits. In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Ibrahim entered into a Severance and Change in Control Agreement providing for the same benefits as described above, but with certain modifications which the Compensation Committee approved in connection with the negotiation of the terms of his offer letter and after considering the input of the Company's compensation consultant at the time. In the event of an involuntary termination, Mr. Ibrahim will also receive a lump sum payment equal to his target annual incentive for the applicable year. In addition, in lieu of the benefits described above, in the event of an involuntary termination occurring six (6) months prior to, or eighteen (18) months after, a change in control, Mr. Ibrahim will receive: (i) a lump sum payment equal to two (2) times annual base salary plus the target annual bonus for the relevant fiscal year, (ii) full acceleration of all outstanding equity awards; and (iii) twenty four (24) months continued health insurance coverage under COBRA. Death and DisabilityWe offer life and accidental death insurance as well as short- and long-term disability insurance through our benefits program. There is no acceleration of any equity awards upon death. Vesting of equity awards continues for employees on short-term disability as such individuals remain employed with the Company during their period of short-term disability. For an employee on short-term disability, we continue to pay the Company’s portion of the employee’s benefits.Risks Related to Compensation Policies and PracticesWhen determining our compensation policies and practices, the Compensation Committee considers various matters relevant to the development of a reasonable and prudent compensation program, including whether the policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that the mix and design of our executive compensation plans and policies do not encourage management to assume excessive risks and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.14Table of ContentsPay Versus PerformanceProvided below is the Company’s “Pay Versus Performance” disclosure as required pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are allowed to comply with scaled back requirements under the pay versus performance rules. As such, and in accordance with such rules, we have excluded the disclosure regarding a peer group’s total shareholder return (“TSR”), a company-selected measure as well as the list of the most important compensation measures used to determine our NEOs’ compensation.

The grant date fair value of equity awards represents the total of the amounts reported in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable fiscal year. The Rule 402(v) Equity Values reflect the aggregate of the following components, as applicable: (i) add the fair value as of the end of the covered fiscal year of all awards granted in the covered fiscal year that are outstanding and unvested as of the end of the covered fiscal year; (ii) add the amount equal to the change as of the end of the covered fiscal year (from the end of the prior fiscal year) in fair value (whether positive or negative) of any awards granted in any prior fiscal year that are outstanding and unvested as of the end of the covered fiscal year; (iii) add, for awards that are granted and vest in the same fiscal year, the fair value as of the vesting date; (iv) add the amount equal to the change as of the vesting date (from the end of the prior fiscal year) in fair value (whether positive or negative) of any awards granted in any prior fiscal year for which all applicable vesting conditions were satisfied at the end of or during the covered fiscal year, and (v) subtract, for any awards granted in any prior fiscal year that fail to meet the applicable vesting conditions during the covered fiscal year, the amount equal to the fair value at the end of the prior fiscal year. Equity values are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, and the valuation assumptions used to calculate fair values did not materially differ from those disclosed at the time of the grant or the Company’s approach to valuation employed in its financial statements. Any awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions are valued based on the attainment level as of the applicable vesting date or, in the case of awards that remain subject to performance conditions as of the end of the applicable fiscal year, based on the probably level of achievement as of such date.(3)The Company TSR reflects the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock, assuming an initial investment of $100 in our common stock at the market close on March 31, 2022 through March 31, 2025, the last business day of our fiscal year 2025.Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and TSR and Net LossAs discussed in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Amended Report, our executive compensation program is designed to align with our status as a more mature, publicly-traded company, while still supporting our overall business and compensation objectives. •Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid to our PEO and the Average Compensation Actually Paid to the Non-PEO NEOs and the Company’s Cumulative TSR. Mr. Meeker's CAP increased from $871,462 in fiscal year 2023 to $2,876,197 in fiscal year 2025. The Average CAP for the Non-PEO NEOs also increased from $637,825 in fiscal year 2023 to $1,403,688 in fiscal year 2025. These increases were primarily driven by increases in overall compensation to further align with the competitive market, with the majority of Mr. Meeker’s increase delivered in long-term incentives, the value of which fluctuates based on our stock price, as well as the appreciation in our stock price, based on a TSR of $37.57 for fiscal year 2023, which increased to a three-year cumulative TSR of $114.88 at the end of fiscal year 2025.•Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid to our PEO and the Average of the Compensation Actually Paid to the Non-PEO NEOs and our Net Loss. Net income/(loss) is not a component of our executive compensation program. Our Net Loss improved by 39.8% from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, and an additional 11.2% from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2025, which was the result of the Company successfully navigating the changing market environment and macro economic factors in each of those years. As described above, Mr. Meeker's CAP increased from $871,462 in fiscal year 2023 to $2,876,197 in fiscal year 2025. The Average CAP for the Non-PEO NEOs also increased from $637,825 in fiscal year 2023 to $1,403,688 in fiscal year 2025. These increases were primarily designed to align compensation with market competitive rates.16Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2025 Director Compensation The following table presents information regarding the compensation of our non-employee directors for services performed for our fiscal year 2025.

In general, directors must make these deferral elections prior to the date of the grant of such RSUs. Directors who make a deferral election will have no right as stockholders with respect to amounts credited to their deferred RSU accounts until such RSUs are settled. Settlement of any RSUs credited to the deferred RSU account in shares of fully vested common stock will occur as soon as practicable following the director’s termination of service as a member of the Board.18Table of ContentsITEM 12.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCECertain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsIn addition to the executive officer and director compensation arrangements discussed in the section titled “Executive Compensation,” we describe below the transactions since April 1, 2023 to which we have been a participant, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or will exceed $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing a household with, any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions Our Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for the review, approval and oversight of any “related party transaction,” which is any transaction, arrangement or relationship (or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we are, were or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which the related person has, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. We have adopted a written related party transaction policy. Under our related party transaction policy, our management is required to submit any related party transaction not previously approved by our Audit Committee to our Audit Committee. In 22Table of Contentsapproving or rejecting the proposed transactions, our Audit Committee takes into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances available. Business CombinationOn June 1, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (“Northern Star”) completed the acquisition of Barkbox. On November 27, 2020, Barkbox issued 5.50% convertible senior secured notes due 2025 (the "Convertible Notes") to Magnetar Capital, LLC, with a principal amount of $75.0 million pursuant to a note purchase agreement and which 2025 Convertible Notes are subject to the terms of an indenture, dated November 27, 2020, between Barkbox and U.S. Bank National Associate, as trustee and collateral agent. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 5.50%, payable entirely in payment-in-kind annually on December 1st of each year commencing on December 1, 2021, compounded annually. The 2025 Convertible Notes remain outstanding, see Note 6 — Debt to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of our Original Report.Registration Rights AgreementPrior to the Closing Date, holders of founders shares and private warrants of Northern Star, along with certain stockholders of Barkbox, entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which they were granted certain rights to have registered, in certain circumstances, for resale under the Securities Act, certain shares of our common stock held by them, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. The Registration Rights Agreement remains outstanding and is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report.Indemnification of Directors and Executive OfficersWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements and our Amended and Restated Bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to very limited exceptions, our Amended and Restated Bylaws also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors and officers. Director IndependenceOur common stock is listed on the NYSE. Under the NYSE rules, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors. In addition, NYSE requires that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Under NYSE rules, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if,
that company’s board of directors affirmatively determines that director has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or indirectly) other than as a Board or committee member in addition to other bright-line requirements set forth in the NYSE listed company manual. Additionally, compensation committee members must not have a relationship with us that is material to the director’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. Our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether each director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. As a result of this review, our Board has determined that, with the exception of Mr. Meeker and Mr. Werdelin, each member of our Board is an “independent director” as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE rules. In making these determinations, our Board reviewed and 23Table of Contentsdiscussed information provided by the directors and by us with regard to each director’s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management, including the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each non-employee director and the transactions involving them described in the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” 24Table of ContentsITEM 14.

The Audit Committee has established a general pre-approval policy for certain audit and non-audit services, up to a specified amount for each identified service that may be provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee approved all services provided by Deloitte during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
