Netcapital
Inc. (the “Company”) is unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2025 (the “2025
Form 10-K”) within the prescribed time period because the Company required additional time to prepare and complete the audit of
its annual financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2025 to be filed with the 2025 Form 10-K. The Company expects to file the
2025 Form 10-K within the 15-day extension period (the “Extension Period”) afforded by Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

To
Form

Part
IV, Item (3)
Based
on information that is available at this time, the Company’s total revenues for the year ended April 30, 2025 are expected to be
approximately $869,460 as compared to total revenues of $4,951,435 for the year ended April 30, 2024. The decrease in revenues is attributable
to decreased revenues from consulting services for equity securities, which recorded a decrease in fees of $3,440,000 to $0
in the year ended April 30, 2025 as compared to $3,440,000 in the year ended April 30, 2024, The Company’s costs of revenues
decreased by $67,716 or 63%, to $40,344 in the year ended April 30, 2025 from $108,060 in the year ended April 30, 2024. The decrease
is attributable to the 82% decrease in revenues in the year ended April 30, 2025, as compared to the year ended April 30, 2024. Consulting
expenses decreased by $295,262, or 48%, to $314,947 for the year ended April 30, 2025 from $610,209 reported in year ended April 30,
2025. The Company decreased its use of individual independent contractors in fiscal 2025. Consulting expenses are payments for services
rendered by non-employees. Marketing expense decreased by $296,072, or approximately 89%, to $37,699 for the year ended April 30, 2025,
as compared to $333,771 in the year ended April 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to limited cash resources. General and administrative
expenses increased by $1,796,981 or 52%, to $5,224,007 for the year ended April 30, 2025, as compared to $3,427,026 for the year ended
April 30, 2025. The primary increase in expenses is attributable to professional fees, which includes costs of attorneys, proxy solicitation,
and investor relations. The Company recognized an unrealized loss in the value of our equity securities of $2,696,135 in the year ended
April 30, 2024, as compared to an unrealized gain of $18,050 in the value of our equity securities in the year ended April 30, 2025.
The loss in the year ended April 30, 2024 was attributable to a decrease in value to $0.16 per share from $1.00 per share for 3,209,685
shares of common stock that we own of KingsCrowd, Inc. The gain in the year ended April 30, 2025 resulted primarily from an increase
in value of our KingsCrowd securities to $0.18 per share, less an unrealized loss of $46,143 in the value of our shares in Netcapital
Systems. We recorded an impairment expense of $19,475,556 and $1,048,430 in the years ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, the Company evaluated its equity investments in multiple issuers for impairment in accordance with
ASC 321-10-35-3. The Company determined that the fair value of several investments had declined below their carrying amounts and that
the declines were other-than-temporary. These conclusions were based on qualitative indicators including the resignation of key personnel,
discontinuation of business operations, termination of fundraising efforts, and other adverse developments. As a result, twelve equity
investments were written-off, creating an impairment expense of $19,475,556. The Company cautions that the estimation of the amounts
set forth above are preliminary and subject to change, possibly materially, following the completion and audit of the Company’s
financial statements.
