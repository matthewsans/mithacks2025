If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort
or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)
(a)
The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;
☒
(b)
The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 11-K, Form N-CEN, or Form N-CSR, or portion thereof, will be filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date; or the subject quarterly report or transition report on Form 10-Q, or subject distribution report on Form 10-D, or portion thereof, will be filed on or before the fifth calendar day following the prescribed date; and

PART III — NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Forms 10-K, 20-F,
11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR, N-CSR, or the transition report portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
Formation Minerals, Inc. (the “Company”) is unable to file
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2025 (the “Quarterly Report”) within the prescribed period,
because the Company requires additional time to prepare and review its financial statements to ensure adequate disclosure of the financial
information required to be included in the Quarterly Report, which delay could not be eliminated by the Company without unreasonable effort
and expense.
The Company currently expects to file the Quarterly Report within the
15 calendar day extension period provided by Rule 12b-25.

On December 11, 2023, the Company and the Company’s
then wholly owned subsidiary, Formation Minerals Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”), entered into an agreement and
plan of merger, as amended as of February 8, 2024 (the “Merger Agreement”), with Verde Bio Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation
and a growing U.S. energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of high-probability, lower risk onshore oil and gas properties
within the major oil and gas plays in the United States (“Verde”), pursuant to which effective at 4:15 p.m., Eastern Time,
on May 9, 2024, Merger Sub merged with and into Verde, with Verde surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).
Following the Merger, effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 9, 2024, Verde was merged with and into the Company and ceased to exist
and the Company changed its name to “Formation Minerals, Inc.”. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition because
Verde was determined to be the accounting acquirer (legal subsidiary) and the Company was determined to be the legal acquirer (accounting
acquiree) under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Under the reverse acquisition accounting, the Merger was treated as Verde
issuing equity interests for the net assets of the Company with no goodwill or intangible assets recorded. Accordingly, the Company’s
financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2025 and the corresponding prior year period as well as going forward will be revised
to include the financial results of Verde.
As a result of the completion of the Merger, including the accounting
treatment of the Merger and general transaction expenses related to the Merger, the Company anticipates a significant change in its results
of operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year which will be reflected in the consolidated statements of loss to
be included in the Annual Report. However, due to the delay in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended April 30,
2025, we are not yet able to quantify the anticipated change in our results of operations for the year ended April 30, 2025.
