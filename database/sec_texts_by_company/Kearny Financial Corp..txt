Business StrategyWe have evolved our business model from that of a traditional thrift into that of a full-service community bank. This evolution has been accomplished by growing our commercial loans and deposits, expanding our product and service offerings, de-novo branching and the acquisition of other financial institutions. During this time, our strategy has been largely focused on profitably deploying capital and enhancing earnings through a variety of balance sheet growth and diversification strategies. The key components of our business strategy are as follows:•Focus on Relationship Banking and Core DepositsWe remain focused on acquiring and retaining core non-maturity deposit accounts while deepening customer relationships through personalized, high-touch service. Our approach emphasizes building long-term client trust and loyalty. To further grow our base of core deposits, we are expanding our business banking efforts through dedicated business development teams and tailored product offerings designed to meet the evolving needs of our target business clients. As of June 30, 2025, core non-maturity deposit accounts totaled $3.70 billion, representing 65.2% of total deposits, a testament to the strength and stability of our relationship-driven strategy.3Table of Contents•Diversify Loan PortfolioWe remain focused on enhancing the diversification of our loan portfolio by originating higher-yielding commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, and home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). These efforts are designed to improve net interest margins and better manage interest rate risk. To support this strategy, we have built a team of experienced relationship managers with deep expertise in serving small to middle-market businesses, enabling us to expand our reach and deliver tailored lending solutions that align with our clients’ evolving needs.•Advancing Our Technology TransformationOur commitment to digital innovation remains a strategic priority. Over the past year, we have continued to invest significant resources into enhancing both our internal infrastructure and client-facing technology platforms. Our cloud-based, best-in-class digital banking and online account opening platform has become a cornerstone of our omnichannel strategy, delivering seamless and secure experiences across all client touchpoints. This transformation continues to drive improvements across residential and commercial lending, retail deposit gathering, risk management, and back-office operations. Looking ahead, we will build on this momentum by expanding our digital capabilities, introducing new products and services, and entering new markets with greater agility and efficiency.•Maintain Robust Capital and Liquidity LevelsAs demonstrated by the June 30, 2025 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios of the Company and the Bank of 14.49% and 13.61%, respectively, we continue to maintain capital levels well above both regulatory minimums and our internal capital adequacy guidelines, and we remain committed to sustaining this strong capital position.In addition to our robust capital levels, we maintain significant sources of both on- and off-balance sheet liquidity and plan to continue to do so. At June 30, 2025, our liquid assets included $167.3 million of short-term cash and equivalents supplemented by $1.01 billion of investment securities classified as available for sale, which can be readily sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $845.0 million via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions and $695.0 million and $1.19 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”), respectively, without pledging additional collateral.•Driving Operating EfficiencyWe remain committed to improving operating efficiency through organic initiatives, including increased adoption of technology and ongoing evaluation of our branch network. We continue to assess branch performance with a focus on strategic consolidations where appropriate, taking into account factors such as historical profitability, market demographics, geographic proximity, and the potential impact on our clients and communities.Market Area. At June 30, 2025, our primary market area consisted of the counties in which we currently operate branches, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union counties in New Jersey and Kings (Brooklyn) and Richmond (Staten Island) counties in New York. Our lending is concentrated in New Jersey and New York and our predominant sources of deposits are the communities in which our offices are located as well as the neighboring communities.Competition. We operate in a highly competitive market area with a large concentration of financial institutions and we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A number of our competitors are significantly larger institutions with greater financial and technological resources and lending limits. Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability. Our competition for deposits and loans comes from other insured depository institutions located in our primary market area as well as out-of-market depository institutions operating via online channels and from non-depository institutions including mortgage banks, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and financial technology companies.4Table of ContentsLending ActivitiesGeneral. Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family mortgage loans, nonresidential mortgage loans, commercial business loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans.

At June 30, 2025, multi-family mortgage loans totaled $2.71 billion, or 46.6% of our loan portfolio, while nonresidential mortgage loans totaled $986.6 million, or 17.0% of our loan portfolio. We originate a variety of types of commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential property loans, as well as loans on mixed-use properties which combine residential and commercial space. We generally offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate balloon mortgage loans on multi-family and nonresidential properties with final stated maturities ranging from three to 15 years with amortization terms which generally range from 15 to 30 years. Our commercial mortgage loans are primarily secured by properties located in New Jersey, New York and the surrounding states.Commercial and Industrial Business (C&I) Loans. At June 30, 2025, commercial and industrial business loans totaled $138.8 million, or 2.4% of our loan portfolio. We originate commercial term loans and lines of credit to a variety of clients in our market area. Our commercial term loans generally have terms of up to 10 years. Our commercial lines of credit have terms of up to two years and are generally floating-rate loans.Construction Lending. At June 30, 2025, construction loans totaled $177.7 million, or 3.1% of our loan portfolio. Our construction lending includes loans to individuals, builders or developers for the construction of multi-family residential buildings or commercial real estate or for the construction or renovation of one- to four-family residences. Construction borrowers must hold title to the land free and clear of any liens. Financing for construction loans is limited to 80% of the anticipated appraised value of the completed property. Disbursements are made in accordance with inspection reports by our approved inspection firms. Terms of financing are generally limited to one year with an interest rate tied to the prime rate and may include a premium of one or more points. In some cases, we convert a construction loan to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of construction. We have no formal limits as to the number of projects a builder has under construction or development and make a case-by-case determination on loans to builders and developers who have multiple projects under development.6Table of ContentsOne- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans Held in Portfolio. At June 30, 2025, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $1.75 billion, or 30.1% of our loan portfolio. At June 30, 2025, $1.63 billion, or 93.3%, of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans were secured by properties located within New Jersey and New York with the remaining $118.5 million, or 6.7%, secured by properties in other states. The fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate for portfolio generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). In addition, we offer a first-time homebuyer program which provides financial incentives for persons who have not previously owned real estate and are purchasing a one- to four-family property in our primary lending area for use as a primary residence. One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale. As a complement to our residential one- to four-family portfolio lending activities, we operate a mortgage banking platform which supports the origination of one- to four-family mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The loans we originate for sale generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of Freddie Mac. Such loans are generally originated by, and sourced from, the same resources and markets as those loans originated and held in our portfolio. Our mortgage banking business strategy resulted in the recognition of $806,000 in gains associated with the sale of $112.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2025. As of that date, an additional $5.9 million of loans were held and committed for sale into the secondary market.Home Equity Loans. At June 30, 2025, our fixed-rate home equity loans and adjustable home equity lines of credit totaled $50.7 million, or 0.9% of our loan portfolio. These loans and lines of credit generally have terms of up to 20 years. Other Consumer Loans. At June 30, 2025, other consumer loans totaled $2.5 million, or 0.04% of our loan portfolio. Our consumer loan portfolio includes unsecured overdraft lines of credit and personal loans as well as loans secured by savings accounts and certificates of deposit on deposit with the Bank. Loans to One Borrower. New Jersey law generally limits the amount that a savings bank may lend to a single borrower and related entities to 15% of the institution’s capital funds. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2025, our legal loans to one borrower limit was approximately $105.7 million. At June 30, 2025, our largest single borrower had an aggregate outstanding loan exposure of approximately $81.6 million comprising six multi-family mortgage loans. At June 30, 2025, this lending relationship was current and performing in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements.7Table of ContentsLoan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments.

Senior management recommends, and the Board of Directors approves, our lending policies and loan approval limits. The Bank’s Loan Committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer and other members of senior management. Loans which exceed certain thresholds, as defined within our policies, are submitted to the Bank’s Loan Committee and/or Board of Directors for approval.Asset QualityCollection Procedures on Delinquent Loans. We regularly monitor the payment status of all loans within our portfolio and promptly initiate collection efforts on past due loans in accordance with applicable policies and procedures. Delinquent borrowers are notified when a loan is 30 days past due. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and additional collection notices are sent. All reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection. However, when a residential loan is 120 days delinquent and a commercial loan is 90 days delinquent, it is our general practice to refer it to an attorney for repossession, foreclosure or other form of collection action, as appropriate. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs as we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency.8Table of ContentsAs to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When other real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial write-down of the property, if necessary, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines are identified.Past Due Loans. A loan’s past due status is generally determined based upon its principal and interest (“P&I”) payment delinquency status in conjunction with its past maturity status, where applicable. A loan’s P&I payment delinquency status is based upon the number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P&I payment due and the as of measurement date. A loan’s past maturity status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan’s contractual maturity date and the as of measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following past due tiers for financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days past due), 30-59 days past due, 60-89 days past due and 90 or more days past due.Additional information about our past due loans is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Nonaccrual Loans. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when we do not expect to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 days past due but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and we expect to receive all remaining P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan.Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans (“PCD”). PCD loans are acquired loans that, as of the acquisition date, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Non-PCD loans are acquired loans that have experienced no or insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. To distinguish between the two types of acquired loans, we evaluate risk characteristics that have been determined to be indicators of deteriorated credit quality. The determining criteria may involve loan specific characteristics such as payment status, debt service coverage or other changes in creditworthiness since the loan was originated, while others are relevant to recent economic conditions, such as borrowers in industries impacted by the pandemic. As part of our acquisition of MSB Financial Corp., we acquired PCD loans with a par value of $69.4 million and an allowance for credit losses of $3.9 million. Additional information about our PCD loans is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Nonperforming Assets. The following table provides information regarding our nonperforming assets which are comprised of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, nonaccrual loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned:At June 30, 20252024(Dollars In Thousands) Nonaccrual loans$45,597 $39,882 Other real estate owned— — Total nonperforming assets$45,597 $39,882 Total nonaccrual loans to total loans0.78 %0.70 %Total nonperforming loans to total loans0.78 %0.70 %Total nonperforming loans to total assets0.59 %0.52 %Total nonperforming assets to total assets0.59 %0.52 %Total nonperforming assets increased by $5.7 million to $45.6 million at June 30, 2025 from $39.9 million at June 30, 2024. For those same comparative periods, the number of nonperforming loans remained unchanged at 48 loans. There were no properties in OREO at June 30, 2025 and 2024.9Table of ContentsLoan Review System. We maintain a loan review system consisting of several related functions including, but not limited to, classification of assets, calculation of the allowance for credit losses, independent credit file review as well as internal audit and lending compliance reviews. We utilize both internal and external resources, where appropriate, to perform the various loan review functions, all of which operate in accordance with a scope and frequency determined by senior management and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.As one component of our loan review system we engage a third-party firm which specializes in loan review and analysis functions. As part of their review process, our third-party review firm compares their review results with their client base to evaluate our risk assessment among our peers. This firm assists senior management and the Board of Directors in identifying potential credit weaknesses; in reviewing and confirming risk ratings or adverse classifications internally ascribed to loans by management; in identifying relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolio and identifying segments of the portfolio that are potential problem areas; in verifying the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; in evaluating the activities of lending personnel including compliance with lending policies and the quality of their loan approval, monitoring and risk assessment; and by providing an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio. Currently, third-party loan reviews are being conducted quarterly and include non-performing loans as well as samples of performing loans of varying types within our portfolio.In addition, our loan review system includes functions performed by internal audit and compliance personnel. Internal audit resources perform credit review functions utilizing guidance from regulatory and Institute of Internal Auditors standards in addition to assessing the adequacy of, and adherence to, internal credit policies and loan administration procedures and adherence to regulatory guidance. Our compliance resources monitor adherence to relevant lending-related and consumer protection-related laws and regulations. Classification of Assets. In compliance with the regulatory guidelines, our loan review system includes an evaluation process through which certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. An asset is classified as Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified as Loss are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses are designated as Special Mention by management. “Substandard” and “doubtful” loans are generally referred to as Classified Assets, which possess greater risk characteristics than “special mention” loans. Non-classified assets are internally rated within one of four Pass categories or as Watch with the latter denoting a potential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by management until remediated.Additional information about our classification of assets is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.The following table discloses our designation of certain loans as special mention or adversely classified during each of the two years presented:At June 30,20252024(In Thousands)Substandard$118,346 $67,738 Doubtful72 86 Loss— — Total classified loans118,418 67,824 Special mention15,033 50,876 Total classified and special mention loans$133,451 $118,700 Individually Evaluated Loans. On a case-by-case basis, we may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When we determine that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, we will establish an allowance for the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan.10Table of ContentsAllowance for Credit Losses - LoansA description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses.”Additional information about our allowance for credit losses is also presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses in financial assets at the balance sheet date.

The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans receivable at the dates indicated. The ACL allocated to each category is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in any particular category as of the balance sheet date and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.At June 30,20252024AmountPercent of Loansto Total LoansAmountPercent of Loansto Total Loans(Dollars In Thousands)Multi-family mortgage$24,906 46.60 %$24,125 46.02 %Nonresidential mortgage6,938 16.97 6,125 16.49 Commercial business2,428 2.39 1,573 2.48 Construction1,155 3.06 1,230 3.64 One- to four-family residential mortgage10,180 30.07 11,461 30.55 Home equity loans490 0.87 349 0.77 Other consumer94 0.04 76 0.05 Total$46,191 100.00 %$44,939 100.00 %At June 30, 2025, the ACL totaled $46.2 million, or 0.79% of total loans, reflecting an increase of $1.3 million from $44.9 million, or 0.78% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase was largely attributable to higher reserves for individually evaluated loans.The ACL at June 30, 2025 was maintained at a level that was management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in loans at the balance sheet date. The ACL is subject to estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available and as events or conditions effecting individual borrowers and the marketplace as a whole change over time. Additions to the ACL may be necessary if the future economic environment deteriorates from forecasted conditions. In addition, the banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios, related ACL and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The regulators may require the ACL to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which may negatively affect our earnings.Additional information about the ACL at June 30, 2025 and 2024 is presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Investment SecuritiesAt June 30, 2025, our investment securities portfolio totaled $1.13 billion and comprised 14.6% of our total assets. By comparison, at June 30, 2024, our securities portfolio totaled $1.21 billion and comprised 15.7% of our total assets. Additional information about our investment securities at June 30, 2025 is presented in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements.The year-over-year net decrease in the securities portfolio totaled $75.4 million which largely reflected repayments and sales that were partially offset by purchases. The decrease in the portfolio included a $18.5 million increase in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio to an unrealized loss of $112.1 million at June 30, 2025 from an unrealized loss of $130.7 million at June 30, 2024.Our investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, is designed to foster earnings and manage cash flows within prudent interest rate risk and credit risk guidelines, taking into consideration our liquidity needs, asset/liability management goals, and performance objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Treasurer/Chief Investment Officer are the senior management members of our Capital Markets Committee that are designated by the Board of Directors as the officers primarily responsible for securities portfolio management and all transactions require the approval of at least two of these designated officers.The investments authorized for purchase under the investment policy approved by our Board of Directors include U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency debentures, municipal obligations, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and subordinated debt. 13Table of ContentsThe carrying value of our mortgage-backed securities totaled $602.8 million at June 30, 2025 and comprised 53.2% of total investments and 7.8% of total assets as of that date. We generally invest in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored entities. Mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored entities are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest to investors.The carrying value of our securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled $7.6 million at June 30, 2025 and comprised 0.7% of total investments and less than 1.0% of total assets as of that date. Such securities primarily included highly-rated, fixed-rate bank-qualified securities representing general obligations of municipalities located within the U.S. or the obligations of their related entities such as boards of education or school districts. Each of our municipal obligations were consistently rated by Moody’s and S&P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling A- or higher by S&P or A2 or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies. In the absence of, or as a complement to, such ratings, we rely upon our own internal analysis of the issuer’s financial condition to validate its investment grade assessment.The carrying value of our asset-backed securities totaled $59.5 million at June 30, 2025 and comprised 5.3% of total investments and 0.8% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities representing securitized federal education loans with 97% U.S. government guarantees. Our securities represent the highest credit-quality tranches within the overall structures with each being rated AA+ or higher by S&P or Aa1 or higher by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.The outstanding balance of our collateralized loan obligations totaled $323.2 million at June 30, 2025 and comprised 28.5% of total investments and 4.2% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities representing securitized commercial loans to large, U.S. corporations. At June 30, 2025, each of our collateralized loan obligations were consistently rated by Moody’s and/or S&P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody’s, where rated by those agencies.The carrying value of our corporate bonds totaled $140.1 million at June 30, 2025 and comprised 12.4% of total investments and 1.8% of total assets as of that date. This category of securities consists of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt issued by community banks, primarily located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. At June 30, 2025, the majority of our subordinated debt holdings were rated by either Moody’s, S&P, DBRS, KBRA or EJR (collectively “NRSROs”) at or above the thresholds that generally support our minimum investment grade assessment at BBB-/Baa3 or higher by these NRSROs. Current accounting standards require that debt securities be categorized as held to maturity or available for sale, based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. These standards allow debt securities to be classified as held to maturity and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as held to maturity.We do not currently use or maintain a trading account. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale. These securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity. As of June 30, 2025, our available for sale securities portfolio had a carrying value of $1.01 billion or 89.4% of our total securities with the remaining $120.2 million or 10.6% of securities were classified as held to maturity.Other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, we did not hold securities of any one issuer having an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity at June 30, 2025. All of our securities carry market risk insofar as increases in market interest rates have caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in their market value. We believe that unrealized and unrecognized losses on securities held at June 30, 2025, are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at that time.During the year ended June 30, 2025, there were no sales of securities available for sale. During the year ended June 30, 2024, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled $104.1 million and resulted in no gross gains and gross losses of $18.1 million. During the year ended June 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled $105.2 million and resulted in no gross gains and gross losses of $15.2 million. There were no sales of held to maturity securities during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023.14Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated:At June 30,20252024(In Thousands)Debt securities available for sale:Asset-backed securities$59,498 $80,440 Collateralized loan obligations323,245 389,543 Corporate bonds140,117 131,797 Total debt securities available for sale522,860 601,780 Mortgage-backed securities available for sale:  Residential pass-through securities357,319 337,264 Commercial pass-through securities132,790 133,789 Total mortgage-backed securities available for sale490,109 471,053 Total securities available for sale1,012,969 1,072,833 Debt securities held to maturity:  Obligations of state and political subdivisions7,553 12,913 Total debt securities held to maturity7,553 12,913 Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity:  Residential pass-through securities100,482 110,614 Commercial pass-through securities12,182 12,215 Total mortgage-backed securities held to maturity112,664 122,829 Total securities held to maturity120,217 135,742 Total securities$1,133,186 $1,208,575 15Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying values, weighted average yields and maturities of our securities portfolio at June 30, 2025.

Retail deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition, we derive funds from principal repayments of loan and investment securities. Loan and securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Wholesale funding sources including, but not limited to, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”), wholesale deposits and other short-term borrowings are also used to supplement the funding for loans and investments.Deposits. Our current deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from 30 days to five years. Certificates of deposit with terms ranging from six months to five years are available for individual retirement account plans. Deposit account terms, such as interest rate earned, applicability of certain fees and service charges and funds accessibility, will vary based upon several factors including, but not limited to, minimum balance, term to maturity, and transaction frequency and form requirements.Deposits are obtained primarily from within New Jersey and New York through the Bank’s network of retail branches, business relationship officers, and digital banking channels. We maintain a robust suite of commercial deposit products designed to appeal to small and mid-size businesses, non-profit organizations and government entities. Our team of experienced and dedicated business relationship officers serve as the primary points of contact for these commercial clients and act as both new business originators and relationship managers.The determination of interest rates on retail deposits is based upon a number of factors, including: (1) our need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs; (2) a current survey of a selected group of competitors’ rates for similar products; (3) our current cost of funds, yield on assets and asset/liability position; and (4) the alternate cost of funds on a wholesale basis. Interest rates are reviewed by senior management on a regular basis, with deposit product and pricing updated, as appropriate, during recurring and ad-hoc senior management meetings.Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit maturing within a short period were not renewed. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, certificates of deposit maturing within one year were $1.91 billion and $1.49 billion, respectively. Historically, a significant portion of the certificates of deposit remain with us after they mature.At June 30, 2025, $1.50 billion or 76.0% of our certificates of deposit were certificates of $100,000 or more compared to $1.10 billion or 68.2% at June 30, 2024. Excluding brokered certificates of deposit, $685.8 million or 59.1% of our certificates of deposit were certificates of $100,000 or more at June 30, 2025. The general level of market interest rates and money market conditions significantly influence deposit inflows and outflows. The effects of these factors are particularly pronounced on deposit accounts with larger balances. In particular, certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or greater are traditionally viewed as being a more volatile source of funding than comparatively lower balance certificates of deposit or non-maturity transaction accounts. In order to retain certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more, we may have to pay a premium rate, resulting in an increase in our cost of funds. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with wholesale funding.Our sources of wholesale funding included brokered certificates of deposit whose balances totaled approximately $757.7 million, or 13.4% of total deposits, at June 30, 2025. We utilize brokered certificates of deposit as an alternative to other forms of wholesale funding, including borrowings, when interest rates and market conditions favor the use of such deposits. For a portion of our short-term brokered certificates of deposit we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend their duration and to fix their cost.17Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the distribution of average deposits for the periods indicated and the weighted average nominal interest rates for each period on each category of deposits presented: For the Years Ended June 30,202520242023AverageBalancePercentof TotalDepositsWeightedAverageNominalRateAverageBalancePercentof TotalDepositsWeightedAverageNominalRateAverageBalancePercentof TotalDepositsWeightedAverageNominalRate(Dollars In Thousands)Non-interest-bearing deposits$597,197 10.75 %— %$595,266 11.14 %— %$644,543 10.79 %— %Interest-bearing demand2,335,972 42.04 2.86 2,308,893 43.19 2.91 2,349,802 39.33 1.73 Savings721,115 12.98 1.25 662,981 12.40 0.50 896,651 15.00 0.37 Certificates of deposit1,902,026 34.23 3.39 1,778,682 33.27 2.92 2,083,864 34.88 1.64 .Total average deposits$5,556,310 100.00 %2.53 %$5,345,822 100.00 %2.29 %$5,974,860 100.00 %1.31 %As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the aggregate amount of certificates of deposit of $250,000 and over was $1.0 billion and $633.0 million, respectively.

The sources of wholesale funding we utilize include borrowings in the form of advances from the FHLB as well as other forms of borrowings. We generally use wholesale funding to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process.Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by our FHLB capital stock and certain investment securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans that we choose to utilize as collateral for such borrowings. Additional information about our FHLB advances is included under Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements.At June 30, 2025, we had $1.11 billion of FHLB advances outstanding, excluding a net fair value adjustment of $9,000, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%. At June 30, 2024, we had $1.54 billion of FHLB advances outstanding, excluding a net fair value adjustment of $211,000, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.07%.Our FHLB advances mature as follows:At June 30, 20252024(In Thousands) By remaining period to maturity:Less than one year$906,500 $1,328,500 One to two years— 6,500 Two to three years200,000 — Three to four years— 200,000 Four to five years— — Greater than five years— — Total advances1,106,500 1,535,000 Fair value adjustments(9)(211)Total advances, net of fair value adjustments$1,106,491 $1,534,789 At June 30, 2025, we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend the duration and fix the cost of our FHLB advances maturing in less than one year.Based upon the market value of investment securities and mortgage loans that are posted as collateral for FHLB advances at June 30, 2025, we are eligible to borrow up to an additional $695.0 million of advances from the FHLB as of that date. We are further authorized to post additional collateral in the form of other unencumbered investments securities and eligible mortgage loans that may expand our borrowing capacity with the FHLB up to 30% of our total assets. Additional borrowing capacity up to 50% of our total assets may be authorized with the approval of the FHLB’s Board of Directors or Executive Committee.In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $845.0 million via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions and $1.19 billion from the FRB without pledging additional collateral. The balance of borrowings at June 30, 2025 included overnight line of credit borrowings from the FHLB totaling $150.0 million. There were no unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions at June 30, 2025.Interest Rate Derivatives and HedgingWe utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps, caps and floors to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting requirements, we formally designate all of our hedging relationships as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, and document the strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness.At June 30, 2025, our derivative instruments were comprised of interest rate swaps, caps and a floor with a total notional amount of $3.08 billion. These instruments are intended to manage the interest rate exposure relating to certain wholesale funding positions and assets that were outstanding at June 30, 2025.Additional information regarding our use of interest rate derivatives and our hedging activities is presented in Note 1 and Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements.19Table of ContentsSubsidiary ActivityAt June 30, 2025, Kearny Bank was the only wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Kearny Financial Corp. As of that date, Kearny Bank had three wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Company, 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC and Kearny Wealth Management LLC. CJB Investment Company is a New Jersey Investment Company and remained active through the three-year period ended June 30, 2025. 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC was formed during the year ended June 30, 2023 for the purpose of ownership and operation of commercial real estate. The Kearny Wealth Management LLC subsidiary was formed in February 2024 for the purpose of providing insurance brokerage services via a third-party service provider.Human Capital ResourcesYear over year, our Kearny Bank team continues to strengthen client relationships and promote growth within the communities we serve through our consistent dedicated service and unprecedented resiliency.

This system of regulation establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings and loan holding company and New Jersey savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations governing the activities and operations of Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution and its holding company, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including changes in the regulations governing savings and loan holding companies, could have a material adverse impact on Kearny Financial, Kearny Bank and their operations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of Kearny Bank and/or Kearny Financial or impose burdensome requirements upon one or both of them could reduce their profitability and could impair the value of Kearny Bank’s franchise, resulting in negative effects on the trading price of our common stock.Regulation of Kearny BankGeneral. As a nonmember New Jersey savings bank with federally insured deposits, the activities of Kearny Bank are subject to extensive regulation by the NJDBI and the FDIC, including restrictions or requirements with respect to loans to one borrower, dividends, permissible investments and lending activities, liquidity, transactions with affiliates and community reinvestment. Both state and federal law regulate a savings bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of Kearny Bank’s mortgage documents.Kearny Bank must file reports with the NJDBI and FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition and obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as establishing new branches and mergers with or acquisitions of other depository institutions. The NJDBI and FDIC regularly examine Kearny Bank and prepare reports to Kearny Bank’s Board of Directors on any deficiencies found in its operations. The agencies have substantial discretion to take enforcement action with respect to an institution that fails to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or engages in violations of law or regulation, or unsafe and unsound practices. Such actions can include, among others, the issuance of a cease and desist order, assessment of civil money penalties, removal of officers and directors and appointment of a receiver or conservator.Activities and Powers. Kearny Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and the related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, New Jersey savings banks, including Kearny Bank, generally may invest in real estate mortgages; consumer and commercial loans; specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; certain types of corporate equity securities and other specified assets. A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on individual and aggregate amounts of investments. New Jersey savings banks may also exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks, federal savings banks or federal savings associations either directly or through a subsidiary. New Jersey savings banks may exercise powers, rights, benefits and privileges of out-of-state banks, savings banks and savings associations either directly or through a subsidiary, but prior approval by the NJDBI is required before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is further limited by federal law and the related regulations. See “—Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as principal and equity investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, except such activities and investments that are specifically exempted by law or regulation, or approved by the FDIC.Before engaging as principal in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank, or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC, subject to certain specified exceptions. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional requirements. Additionally, New Jersey 21Table of Contentsparity provisions authorize New Jersey savings banks, subject to certain limitations, to exercise the powers, rights, benefits and privileges authorized for national or out-of-state banks, or federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associationsFederal Deposit Insurance. Kearny Bank’s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. The general maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor per account ownership category.The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets, such as Kearny Bank, are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. Effective January 1, 2023, the assessment range for insured institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets is 2.5 to 32 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Kearny Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.Regulatory Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require nonmember banks to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4.0%. The current requirements implement recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of federal law.For purposes of the regulatory capital standards, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. At June 30, 2025, Kearny Bank has exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to equity interests depending on certain specified factors.In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. At June 30, 2025, Kearny Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but also qualitative factors. The FDIC has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 22Table of ContentsDepository institutions and their holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. Kearny Bank did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework as of June 30, 2025.Regulations issued by the NJDBI establish generally similar regulatory capital standards for New Jersey-chartered savings banks such as Kearny Bank.Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Qualifying banks that elect and comply with the community bank leverage ratio (as established by the regulatory agencies) are considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulationsThe FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater. Further, to be deemed well capitalized, the institution must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the FDIC to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0%. Critically undercapitalized status is triggered if an institution has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.Undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the adequately capitalized status. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after such status is triggered. These actions are in addition to other discretionary supervisory or enforcement actions that the FDIC may take.As of June 30, 2025, Kearny Bank was well capitalized.Dividend Limitations. Federal regulations impose various restrictions or requirements on Kearny Bank to pay dividends to Kearny Financial. An institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Kearny Bank, must file notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least thirty days before paying a dividend. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a notice if: (i) the institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement or condition imposed in connection with an application.New Jersey law specifies that no dividend may be paid if the dividend would impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, no dividend may be paid unless the savings bank would, after payment of the dividend, have a surplus of at least 50% of its capital stock (or if the payment of dividend would not reduce surplus).23Table of ContentsTransactions with Affiliates. Transactions between a depository institution (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W. An affiliate of an institution includes any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the institution. In a holding company context, the parent holding company and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W limit the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and set an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes an extension of credit to, purchase of securities and assets from, or issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit to, an affiliate, among other types of transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W also require that transactions with affiliates generally be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the institution as, those provided to non-affiliates.Extension of Credit to Insiders. Kearny Bank’s authority to extend credit to its and its affiliates’ directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, subject to certain exceptions, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:•be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and•not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Kearny Bank’s regulatory capital and surplus.In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Kearny Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), every insured depository institution, including Kearny Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess the depository institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider that record in its consideration of certain applications by the institution, such as for a merger or the establishment of a branch office. The FDIC may use an unsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for denying such an application. Kearny Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating from the FDIC in its most recent CRA evaluation.Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:•Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s capital; or•Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.24Table of ContentsFederal Home Loan Bank System. Kearny Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, which is one of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by financial institutions and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB.As a member, Kearny Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of New York in specified amounts. The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral and limiting total advances to a member.The FHLB of New York may pay periodic dividends to members. These dividends are affected by factors such as the FHLB’s operating results and statutory responsibilities that may be imposed such as providing certain funding for affordable housing and interest subsidies on advances targeted for low- and moderate-income housing projects. The payment of dividends, or any particular amount of dividend, cannot be assumed.Other Laws and RegulationsInterest and other charges collected or contracted for by Kearny Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Kearny Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws (and their implementing regulations) applicable to credit transactions, such as the:•Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;•Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;•Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;•Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;•Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and•Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.The operations of Kearny Bank also are subject to the:•Truth in Savings Act, prescribing disclosure and advertising requirements with respect to deposit accounts;•Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;•Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;•Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;•Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act, which requires institutions to, among other things, establish anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity;•Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties; and25Table of Contents•Regulations requiring banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours of determining that a “computer-security incident” that arises to the level of a “notification incident” has occurred. A notification incident is a “computer-security incident” that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization’s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Bank service providers are also required to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services “as soon as possible” after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided to such bank for four or more hours.Regulation of Kearny FinancialGeneral. Kearny Financial is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of federal law. Kearny Financial maintained its savings and loan holding company status (rather than becoming a bank holding company), notwithstanding the June 2017 conversion of Kearny Bank to a New Jersey savings bank charter, through Kearny Bank exercising an election available to it under federal law. Kearny Financial is required to file reports with, and is subject to regulation and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. Kearny Financial must also obtain regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board before engaging in certain transactions, such as mergers with or acquisitions of other depository institutions. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Kearny Financial and its non-depository subsidiaries. That permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to pose a serious risk to Kearny Bank. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for protection of Kearny Bank’s depositors and not for the benefit of stockholders of Kearny Financial.The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, to the greatest extent possible taking into account any unique characteristics of savings and loan holding companies and the requirements of federal law, its approach is to apply to savings and loan holding companies the supervisory principles applicable to the supervision of bank holding companies. The stated objective of the Federal Reserve Board is to ensure the savings and loan holding company and its non-depository subsidiaries are effectively supervised, can serve as a source of strength for and do not threaten the safety and soundness of, the subsidiary depository institution.Nonbanking Activities. As a savings and loan holding company, Kearny Financial is permitted to engage in those activities permissible under federal law for financial holding companies (if certain criteria are met and an election is submitted) and for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Mergers and Acquisitions. Kearny Financial must generally obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation, or purchase of its assets. Federal law also prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized for savings and loan holding companies by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating an application for Kearny Financial to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Kearny Financial and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community served and competitive factors. A merger of another depository institution into Kearny Bank requires the prior approval of the NJDBI and FDIC, based on similar considerations.Consolidated Capital Requirements. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions (including the community bank leverage ratio alternative) apply to savings and loan holding companies with $3 billion or more of consolidated assets, including Kearny Financial. Kearny Financial was in compliance with the holding company capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer as of June 30, 2025. 26Table of ContentsSource of Strength Doctrine; Dividends. Federal law extended the source of strength doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength doctrine, which requires holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial distress. Further, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also applied to savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff as to dividends in certain circumstances, such as when the dividend is not covered by earnings for the period for which it is being paid, when net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or when the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. In addition, a subsidiary institution of a savings and loan holding company must file prior notice with the Federal Reserve Board, and receive its non-objection, before paying a dividend to the parent savings and loan holding company. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for regulatory review of certain stock redemption and repurchase proposals by holding companies. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Kearny Financial to pay dividends, engage in stock redemptions or repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions.Qualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for Kearny Financial to be regulated by the Federal Reserve Board as a savings and loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Kearny Bank must remain a qualified thrift lender under applicable law or satisfy the domestic building and loan association test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified thrift lender test, an institution is generally required to maintain at least 65% of its portfolio assets (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible assets, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12 month period. As of June 30, 2025, Kearny Bank met the qualified thrift lender test.Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and its implementing regulations, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire control of a savings and loan holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the ownership, control, or holding with power to vote of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a savings and loan holding company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and its implementing regulations, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial condition of the acquirer, and future prospects of the proposed acquirer, the competence and integrity of the proposed acquirer and the effects of the acquisition on competition.Any company that seeks to acquire “control” of Kearny Financial or Kearny Bank, within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act, must file an application, and receive the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval under that statute. The Company would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.The prior approval of the NJDBI would also be necessary for the acquisition of 25% of a class of the Company’s voting stock, or “control” as otherwise defined under New Jersey law.Incentive Compensation. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule implementing the incentive-based compensation recovery (“clawback”) provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule directs national securities exchanges and associations, including NASDAQ, to require listed companies to develop and implement clawback policies to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of a required accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and to disclose their clawback policies and any actions taken under these policies. On June 9, 2023, the SEC approved the NASDAQ proposed clawback listing standards, including the amendments that delayed the effective date of the rules to October 2, 2023. The Board of Directors of Kearny Financial approved the adoption of a clawback policy in October 2023, pursuant to the NASDAQ clawback listing standards. A copy of the Company’s clawback policy is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.27Table of ContentsItem 1A.

The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to these risks and any other risks or uncertainties described in “Item 1. Business—Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Interest RateOur business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates.We derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. In addition, it takes longer for our assets to reprice to adjust to a new rate environment because fixed rate loans do not fluctuate with interest rate changes and adjustable rate loans often have a specified initial fixed rate period before reset. As of June 30, 2025, 75.5% of our loan portfolio was comprised of fixed rate loans. A flattening or an inversion of the yield curve is likely to have a negative impact on our net interest income.Beginning in March 2022, in response to rising inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (the “Committee”) initiated a series of systematic rate hikes, raising the target federal funds rate from 0.00%–0.25% to a peak of 5.25%–5.50% by July 2023. In the second half of 2024, the Committee began easing rates, bringing the target range down to 4.25%–4.50%, where it has remained through June 2025. As of June 30, 2025, the yield curve had flattened, although it remained inverted at certain maturities, with short-term rates at or above long-term rates. These interest rate dynamics have pressured our net interest spread and net interest margin, both of which have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by significant or unexpected shifts in market rates.Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, a reduction in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing cost. In addition, interest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease.A significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally yield less than loans and are classified as available for sale, potentially contributing to increased volatility in our equity.Our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2025, $1.01 billion, or 89.4% of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income.Changes in market interest rates also impact the value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the value of our derivatives portfolios. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives serving as cash flows hedges are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders’ equity. Consequently, declines in the fair value of these instruments resulting from changes in market interest rates have, and may continue to, adversely affect stockholders’ equity.28Table of ContentsA significant portion of our loan portfolio has interest rates that will reset over the next 24 months. In addition, a significant portion of our portfolio will mature over the next 24 months. Applicable increases in interest rates could harm our borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans.As of June 30, 2025, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is scheduled to reset or mature during fiscal 2026 and 2027. Many of these loans were originated in calendar 2021 and 2022 at interest rates below current market levels. As a result, borrowers may face higher interest rates upon reset or refinancing, which could increase their debt service obligations. For maturing loans, borrowers will need to refinance, either with us or another lender, or repay the loans using other sources of funds. These higher borrowing costs may impact borrowers’ ability to meet their obligations, potentially leading to increased delinquencies or defaults. Any such deterioration in borrower performance could negatively affect our asset quality and operating results.Asset QualityIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the required amount of the allowance for credit losses, we evaluate loans individually and establish credit loss allowances for specifically identified impairments. For loans not individually analyzed, we estimate losses and establish reserves based on reasonable and supportable forecasts and adjustments for qualitative factors. If the assumptions used in our calculation methodology are inaccurate, our allowance for credit losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in further additions to our allowance. Significant additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our commercial lending exposes us to additional risk.Our commercial lending exposes us to greater risks than one- to four-family residential lending. Unlike single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from employment and other income sources, and are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable and realizable, the repayment of commercial loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions, and are secured, if at all, by collateral that is more difficult to value or sell or by collateral which may depreciate in value. In addition, commercial loans generally carry larger balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers than one- to four-family mortgage loans, which increases the financial impact of a borrower’s default. The risk exposure from our increased commercial lending is also a function of the markets in which we operate. Our commercial lending activity is generally focused on borrowers domiciled, and real estate located, within the states of New Jersey and New York. Regional risk factors and changes to local laws and regulations, including changes to rent regulations or foreclosure laws, may present greater risk than a more geographically diversified portfolio.Our increased commercial business and construction loan originations exposes us to increased credit risk.We have increased our originations of commercial business and construction loans, which generally have more risk than both one- to four-family residential and commercial mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial business and construction loans may depend on the successful operation of the borrower’s business or the successful completion of a construction project, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. If we continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for credit losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for credit losses would adversely affect our earnings.We have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans. If our regulators were to curtail our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings and/or dividend paying capacity could be adversely affected.In 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued joint guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” (the “Guidance”). The Guidance provides that a bank’s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny when total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family property, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction loans, represent 300% or more of an institution’s total risk-29Table of Contentsbased capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 535% of Bank total risk-based capital at June 30, 2025, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 7% during the preceding 36 months.We may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our investment securities portfolio.We review our securities portfolio at the end of each quarter to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more than likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we would be required to record an impairment charge.We elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. A possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could adversely impact the value of our investment securities portfolio. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.At June 30, 2025, we had investment securities with fair values of approximately $1.12 billion. The valuation and liquidity of our securities could be adversely impacted by reduced market liquidity, increased normal bid-asked spreads and increased uncertainty of market participants, which could reduce the market value of our securities, including those with no apparent credit exposure. The valuation of our securities requires judgment and as market conditions change security values may also change. Significant negative changes to valuations could result in impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our investments in corporate and municipal debt securities, subordinated debt securities and collateralized loan obligations expose us to additional credit risks.The composition and allocation of our investment portfolio has historically emphasized U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. agency debentures. While such assets remain a significant component of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2025, prior enhancements to our investment policies, strategies and infrastructure have enabled us to diversify the composition and allocation of our securities portfolio. Such diversification has included investing in corporate debt, municipal obligations, subordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions and collateralized loan obligations. With the exception of collateralized loan obligations, these securities are generally backed only by the credit of their issuers while investments in collateralized loan obligations generally rely on the structural characteristics of an individual tranche within a larger investment vehicle to protect the investor from credit losses arising from borrowers defaulting on the underlying securitized loans. While we have invested primarily in investment grade securities, these securities are not backed by the federal government and expose us to a greater degree of credit risk than U.S. agency securities. Any decline in the credit quality of these securities exposes us to the risk that the market value of the securities could decrease which may require us to write down their value and could lead to a possible default in payment.FundingOur reliance on wholesale funding could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results.Among other sources of funds, we rely on wholesale funding, including short- and long-term borrowings and brokered deposits, to provide funds with which to make loans, purchase investment securities and provide for other liquidity needs. On June 30, 2025, wholesale funding totaled $2.0 billion, or approximately 26.0% of total assets.In the future, this funding may not be readily replaceable as it matures, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to maintain it. Not being able to maintain or replace those funds as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher interest rates to maintain or replace funding would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results.A lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits being placed on the Company.Liquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to gather deposits, make investments and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund our operations and pay our obligations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale and maturities of loans and securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced by external factors such as changes in interest rates, local and national economic conditions, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments, and perceptions of the stability of the financial services industry generally and of our institution 30Table of Contentsspecifically. Further, the demand for deposits may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers’ disposable income, the monetary policy of the FRB, or regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase our funding costs and reduce net interest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposits to remain competitive with other financial institutions may also adversely affect profitability and liquidity.Other primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities. We have the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB as well as from the FRB without pledging additional collateral, and via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in the value of investment securities, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, a decrease in our business activity as a result of a downturn in markets, or adverse regulatory actions against us. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.A lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators. Depending on the capitalization status and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is subject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.Public funds deposits are a notable source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and liquidity position.Public funds deposits are a notable source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2025, $539.1 million, or 9.5% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, counties, school districts and charter schools. These deposits are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB or through the pledge of eligible investment securities. Given our reliance on these typically high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily floating rate interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and therefore their pricing is more sensitive to changes in interest rates. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to rely on other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net interest income.Economic and Market AreaChanges in economic conditions, in particular an economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could materially and negatively affect our business.Our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Any deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by national or local concerns, in particular any further economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decrease; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers’ borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic downturn or prolonged recession may result in the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would hurt its business. If we experience an economic downturn or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans as scheduled. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our business.31Table of ContentsInflation has had, and may continue to have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and remained elevated through the first half of calendar 2024, before beginning to moderate in the latter half of 2024 and into calendar 2025. However, inflation levels continue to exceed the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2.0%. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which has and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Severe weather could harm our business.Weather-related events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a natural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (i) an increase in loan delinquencies; (ii) an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; (iii) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or (iv) a decrease in the value of the collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing clients’ borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.Interruption of our customers’ supply chains and federal funding could negatively impact their business and operations and impact their ability to repay their loans.Any material interruption in our customers’ supply chains, such as a material interruption of the resources required to conduct their business, such as those resulting from interruptions in service by third-party providers, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, reductions in federal subsidies or grants, social or labor unrest, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics or political disputes and military conflicts, that cause a material disruption in our customers’ supply chains, could have a negative impact on their business and ability to repay their borrowings with us. In the event of disruptions in our customers’ supply chains, the labor and materials they rely on in the ordinary course of business may not be available at reasonable rates or at all. Additionally, changes in distribution of federal funds or freezing of federal funds, including reductions in federal workforce causing unemployment, could have an adverse effect on the ability of consumers and businesses to pay debts and/or affect the demand for loans and deposits.Acts of terrorism, public health issues, and geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflicts, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.We face intense competition from other financial services and financial services technology companies, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business or financial performance.We face intense competition in all of our markets and geographic regions and expect it to intensify in the future. Competition with financial services technology companies, or technology companies partnering with financial services companies, may be particularly intense, due to, among other things, differing regulatory environments. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans or raising the interest rates on deposits in order to keep or attract high-quality clients. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. The actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of our products and other services, developing and maintaining a strong client base, or prudently managing expenses.32Table of ContentsInformation Security and Use of Artificial Intelligence TechnologiesRisks associated with system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could negatively affect our earnings.Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our client relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, performance failures or other exceptions of our client-facing technologies could deter clients from using our products and services. We rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches. We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our clients' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.Our clients are also the target of cyber-attacks, identity theft, and fraud. Large scale identity theft could result in clients' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. The occurrence of a breach of security involving our clients' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.While our Board of Directors takes an active role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on management and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management. Our Board of Directors, including the Information Security Committee, takes an active role in the cybersecurity risk tolerance of the Company and all members receive cybersecurity training annually. The Board reviews the annual information security effectiveness report, risk assessments and approves information security and technology policies. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to information technology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. We also engage outside consultants to support our cybersecurity efforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk management outside of the Company and therefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the input it receives from management and outside consultants.Our adoption of artificial intelligence tools and adoption by our third-party vendors and service providers may increase the risk of errors, omissions, unfair treatment or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, or counterparties, or other third parties.We have made and expect to continue to make investments to integrate artificial intelligence tools into our solutions, including generative artificial intelligence, machine learning, and similar tools and technologies that collect, aggregate, analyze or generate data or other contents (collectively, “AI”), and we expect to continue to adopt such tools responsibly and as appropriate. While these technologies enhance efficiency and scalability, their use can lead to concerns around safety and soundness, fair access to financial services, fair treatment to customers, inaccuracy of results broadly known as "hallucinations" and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AI systems may produce inaccurate, biased, or otherwise flawed outputs due to limitations in training data, model design, or system integration. Errors in AI-driven processes could lead to operational disruptions, regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, or financial loss.Our reliance on third-party AI vendors introduces additional risks, including potential deficiencies in vendor oversight, data governance, and cybersecurity practices. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape governing AI technologies is rapidly evolving. Legislative and regulatory developments may impose new compliance obligations or restrict certain uses of AI. Failure 33Table of Contentsto comply with applicable laws or to adapt to regulatory changes in a timely manner could result in enforcement actions, litigation, or reputational harm.As AI technologies continue to develop, we may be required to invest in enhanced governance, monitoring, and compliance frameworks to manage these risks effectively. Regulatory MattersWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations.The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under the heading “Item 1. Business—Regulation.” These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter the regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and the manner in which companies within the industry conduct business. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Future changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies may occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. These changes may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The performance of our multi-family loans could be adversely impacted by regulation.Multi-family loans generally involve risk of legislation and government regulations involving rent control and rent stabilization, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Company, and could impair the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flows of such properties. As a result of these restrictions, it is possible that rental income on certain rent-regulated properties might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.).Changes to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in tax laws and/or regulatory requirements could be enacted. These changes in the law may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. An increase in our corporate tax rate could have an unfavorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. Similarly, the Bank’s clients could experience varying effects from changes in tax laws and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. In addition, changes to regulatory requirements could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.Business IssuesWe could incur future goodwill impairment.At June 30, 2025, our goodwill totaled $113.5 million. We are required to periodically test our goodwill for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels, but recognition of such an impairment loss could significantly restrict Kearny Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to Kearny Financial and therefore adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value.Our business plan calls for us to execute a variety of strategies to allocate and deploy any excess capital including, but not limited to, continued organic balance sheet growth and diversification, and payment of regular cash dividends. Additionally, we will carefully consider acquisition opportunities to further deploy capital when we expect such opportunities to significantly enhance long-term shareholder value. If we are unable to effectively and timely deploy capital through these strategies, it may constrain growth in earnings and return on equity and thereby diminish potential growth in stockholder value.34Table of ContentsOur acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, may not result in all of the cost savings and benefits anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. There is risk that our acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully; being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition; or the overall performance of the combined entity.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause clients to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively.Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and client attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.Our risk management framework is designed to effectively manage and mitigate risk while minimizing exposure to potential losses. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.We could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that clients, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations.The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.The successful execution of our business strategy is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel. Failure to do so could adversely affect our strategy, client relationships and internal operations.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNot applicable.35Table of ContentsItem 1C.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.’s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and goodwill.Allowance for Credit Losses. The determination of our allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACL”) is considered a critical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved in determining qualitative loss factors, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded ACL. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the ACL.Management believes the following information may enable investors to better understand the changes in our ACL. Our ACL totaled $46.2 million and $44.9 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The $1.3 million increase in our ACL was largely attributable to an increase in reserves for individually evaluated loans. The quantitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on the national unemployment rate forecast, decreased $1.2 million. The qualitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on management’s judgment of qualitative loss factors, increased $0.9 million.Our ACL totaled $46.2 million at June 30, 2025 and the amount allocated to our collectively evaluated multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans was $30.5 million, of which $21.1 million was attributable to qualitative loss factors. Changes in managements’ judgment of qualitative loss factors could result in a significant change to the ACL. As described in Note 1, qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the most severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. At June 30, 2025, the most severe historical loss rate for multi-family and nonresidential mortgages loans was 1.66%.Management performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of a change in a key input on our ACL. At June 30, 2025, if the four-quarter national unemployment rate forecast had been 9% rather than an average of approximately 4.1%, our ACL as a percent of total loans would have increased 34 basis points from 0.79% to 1.13%. This sensitivity analysis includes the impact to both the quantitative and qualitative components of our ACL. Changes in quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may not occur in the same direction or magnitude across all segments of our loan portfolio and deterioration in some quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may offset improvement in others. This sensitivity analysis does not represent a change to our expectations of the economic environment but provides a hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of the ACL to a change in a key input. This sensitivity analysis does not incorporate changes to management’s judgment of qualitative loss factors. Our ACL on individually analyzed loans is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows discounted using the loan’s effective interest rate or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. Our ACL on individually analyzed loans increased $1.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2025. 40Table of ContentsGoodwill. Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. To test goodwill for impairment we elected to perform a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2025. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value, and impairment loss would be recorded.The quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The result of the income approach was weighted at 70% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 30% in determining the fair value of our single reporting unit. The fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment charge required to be recorded for the year ended June 30, 2025. As a result, the Company’s goodwill of $113.5 million remained unchanged from June 30, 2024. Determining fair value of our single reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, and market estimates. In the future, changes in projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, or market estimates may result in further impairment of goodwill.41Table of ContentsFinancial OverviewThe following financial information and other data in this section are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and should be read together therewith:At June 30,202520242023(In Thousands)Balance Sheet Data:Cash and equivalents$167,269 $63,864 $70,515 Assets7,740,450 7,683,461 8,064,815 Net loans receivable5,766,746 5,687,848 5,780,687 Investment securities available for sale1,012,969 1,072,833 1,227,729 Investment securities held to maturity120,217 135,742 146,465 Goodwill113,525 113,525 210,895 Deposits5,675,217 5,158,123 5,629,183 Borrowings1,256,491 1,709,789 1,506,812 Stockholders' equity745,962 753,571 869,284 For the Years Ended June 30, 202520242023(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) Summary of Operations:Interest income$324,476 $328,868 $293,724 Interest expense189,533 186,274 117,859 Net interest income134,943 142,594 175,865 Provision for credit losses2,366 6,226 2,486 Net interest income after provision for credit losses132,577 136,368 173,379 Non-interest income19,052 (1,993)2,751 Non-interest expenses120,630 215,151 123,751 Income (loss) before taxes30,999 (80,776)52,379 Income tax expense4,924 5,891 11,568 Net income (loss)$26,075 $(86,667)$40,811 Per Share Data:Net income (loss) per share - Basic and diluted$0.42 $(1.39)$0.63 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding (in thousands):Basic62,50862,44464,804Diluted62,71662,44464,804Cash dividends per share$0.44 $0.44 $0.44 Dividend payout ratio(1)106.1 %(31.9)%70.2 %________________________________________(1)Represents cash dividends declared divided by net income (loss).42Table of ContentsAt or For the Years Ended June 30, 202520242023Performance Ratios:Return on average assets (ratio of net income to average total assets)0.34 %(1.10)%0.51 %Return on average equity (ratio of net income to average total equity)3.49 %(10.51)%4.66 %Return on average tangible equity (ratio of net income to average tangible equity)(1)4.18 %(13.64)%6.17 %Net interest rate spread1.47 %1.57 %2.09 %Net interest margin1.88 %1.94 %2.34 %Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities115.21 %114.73 %115.66 %Efficiency ratio(2)78.33 %153.02 %69.28 %Non-interest expense to average assets1.58 %2.73 %1.53 %Asset Quality Ratios:Non-performing loans to total loans0.78 %0.70 %0.73 %Non-performing assets to total assets0.59 %0.52 %0.69 %Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding0.02 %0.17 %0.01 %Allowance for credit losses to total loans0.79 %0.78 %0.83 %Allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans101.30 %112.68 %114.33 %Capital Ratios:Average equity to average assets9.77 %10.46 %10.85 %Equity to assets at period end9.64 %9.81 %10.78 %Tangible equity to tangible assets at period end(3)8.27 %8.43 %8.35 %________________________________________(1)Average tangible equity equals average total stockholders’ equity reduced by average goodwill and average core deposit intangible assets.(2)Efficiency ratio equals non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income.(3)Tangible equity equals total stockholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and core deposit intangible assets.Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024Executive Summary. Total assets increased by $57.0 million, or 0.7%, to $7.74 billion at June 30, 2025 from $7.68 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase primarily reflected increases in cash and cash equivalents and net loans receivable, partially offset by decreases in investment securities and other assets.Investment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased by $59.9 million to $1.01 billion at June 30, 2025 from $1.07 billion at June 30, 2024. This decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of $183.8 million, partially offset by purchases of $104.9 million and a $18.5 million increase in the fair value of the portfolio.Investment securities held to maturity decreased by $15.5 million to $120.2 million at June 30, 2025 from $135.7 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of $15.6 million.Additional information regarding investment securities at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Loans Held-for-Sale.

One- to four-family residential mortgage loan origination volume, excluding loans held-for-sale, totaled $144.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 and was supplemented with loan purchases totaling $730,000. Home equity loan and line of credit origination volume for the same period totaled $29.7 million. Additional information about our loans at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans increased by $5.7 million to $45.6 million, or 0.79% of total loans, at June 30, 2025 from $39.9 million, or 0.70% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase in nonperforming loans was largely attributable to an increase of $8.3 million in nonperforming multi-family mortgage loans, partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 million in nonperforming nonresidential mortgage loans.Additional information about nonperforming loans and reportable loan modifications at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1.

The increase was largely attributable to a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for individually evaluated loans, partially offset by net charge-offs of $1.1 million.Additional information about the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.44Table of ContentsOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes, OREO and other assets, decreased by $49.8 million to $667.3 million at June 30, 2025 from $717.1 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in other assets largely reflected a decrease in the market value of interest rate derivatives and a decrease in FHLB stock, partially offset by an increase in BOLI. The remaining change generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items.Deposits. Total deposits increased by $517.1 million, or 10.0%, to $5.68 billion at June 30, 2025 from $5.16 billion at June 30, 2024. Included in total deposits are brokered certificates of deposits (“CDs”) of $757.7 million and $408.2 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase was driven by a reallocation from FHLB advances into brokered CDs and growth in deposits from our branch network and digital channels. The following table sets forth the distribution of, and changes in, deposits, by type, at the dates indicated: June 30,2025June 30,2024Increase/ (Decrease) (In Thousands) Non-interest-bearing deposits$582,045 $598,366 $(16,321)Interest-bearing deposits:Interest-bearing demand2,362,222 2,308,915 53,307 Savings754,376 643,481 110,895 Certificates of deposit (retail)1,218,920 1,199,127 19,793 Certificates of deposit (brokered)757,654 408,234 349,420 Interest-bearing deposits5,093,172 4,559,757 533,415 Total deposits$5,675,217 $5,158,123 $517,094 Uninsured deposits totaled $1.99 billion as of June 30, 2025, compared to $1.77 billion as of June 30, 2024. Excluding collateralized deposits of state and local governments, and deposits of the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary and holding company, uninsured deposits totaled $813.8 million, or 14.3% of total deposits, at June 30, 2025 compared to $764.4 million, or 14.8% of total deposits, at June 30, 2024.Additional information about our deposits at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements. Borrowings. The balance of borrowings decreased by $453.3 million, or 26.5%, to $1.26 billion at June 30, 2025 from $1.71 billion at June 30, 2024 which included overnight borrowings totaling $150.0 million and $175.0 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a net decrease in FHLB and other borrowings as a result of the increase in brokered CDs, as noted above.Additional information about our borrowings at June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1. Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements.Other Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, increased by $802,000 to $62.8 million at June 30, 2025 from $62.0 million at June 30, 2024. The change in the balance of other liabilities generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items.Stockholders’ Equity. Stockholders’ equity decreased by $7.6 million to $746.0 million at June 30, 2025 from $753.6 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in stockholders’ equity during the year ended June 30, 2025 largely reflected $27.7 million in cash dividends and an $8.8 million after-tax other comprehensive loss, partially offset by net income of $26.1 million. The other comprehensive loss during the year ended June 30, 2025 was driven by a decrease in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities.Book value per share decreased by $0.15 to $11.55 at June 30, 2025 while tangible book value per share decreased by $0.13 to $9.77 at June 30, 2025. These decreases were driven by the decrease in stockholders’ equity, as described above.45Table of ContentsComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 Net Income (Loss). Net income for the year ended June 30, 2025 was $26.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, an increase of $112.7 million from a net loss of $86.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the $95.3 million non-cash goodwill impairment recorded in the prior year, net income increased $17.4 million, reflecting an increase in non-interest income and decreases in the provision for credit losses and income tax expense, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense. Net income for the prior year period also included a $12.9 million after-tax net loss on the sale of securities that resulted from the repositioning of our investment securities portfolio in December 2023 and an after-tax net loss of $6.7 million from the previously disclosed BOLI restructure.Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by $7.7 million to $134.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from a decrease of $4.4 million in interest income and an increase of $3.3 million in interest expense. Included in net interest income for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $2.4 million and $2.6 million and loan prepayment penalty income of $783,000 and $879,000.Net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 1.88% for the year ended June 30, 2025, from 1.94% for the year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease reflected increases in the cost and average balances of interest-bearing deposits and decreases in the average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and decreases in the average balances of interest-bearing borrowings.46Table of ContentsDetails surrounding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the years presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense and exclude the impact of prepayment penalties, which are recorded to non-interest income.For the Years Ended June 30,202520242023AverageBalanceInterestAverageYield/CostAverageBalanceInterestAverageYield/CostAverageBalanceInterestAverageYield/Cost(Dollars in Thousands)Interest-earning assets:Loans receivable (1)$5,789,583 $262,992 4.54 %$5,752,496 $256,007 4.45 %$5,827,123 $233,147 4.00 %Taxable investment securities(2)1,270,262 53,247 4.19 1,438,200 63,313 4.40 1,532,961 54,855 3.58 Tax-exempt securities (2)9,791 234 2.39 14,718 336 2.28 30,332 694 2.29 Other interest-earning assets(3)119,224 8,003 6.71 131,019 9,212 7.03 115,390 5,028 4.36 Total interest-earning assets7,188,860 324,476 4.51 7,336,433 328,868 4.48 7,505,806 293,724 3.91 Non-interest-earning assets459,986 541,859 563,131  Total assets$7,648,846  $7,878,292  $8,068,937  Interest-bearing liabilities:Interest-bearing demand$2,335,972 $66,835 2.86 $2,308,893 $67,183 2.91 $2,349,802 $40,650 1.73 Savings721,115 9,011 1.25 662,981 3,293 0.50 896,651 3,351 0.37 Certificates of deposit1,902,026 64,412 3.39 1,778,682 51,938 2.92 2,083,864 34,162 1.64 Total interest-bearing deposits4,959,113 140,258 2.83 4,750,556 122,414 2.58 5,330,317 78,163 1.47 FHLB advances1,131,662 42,014 3.71 1,458,941 53,948 3.70 1,101,658 37,734 3.43 Other borrowings149,041 7,261 4.87 184,768 9,912 5.36 57,468 1,962 3.41 Total borrowings1,280,703 49,275 3.85 1,643,709 63,860 3.89 1,159,126 39,696 3.42 Total interest-bearing liabilities6,239,816 189,533 3.04 6,394,265 186,274 2.91 6,489,443 117,859 1.82 Non-interest-bearing liabilities(4)662,028 659,710 704,136  Total liabilities6,901,844 7,053,975 7,193,579  Stockholders' equity747,002 824,317 875,358  Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$7,648,846 $7,878,292 $8,068,937  Net interest income$134,943  $142,594 $175,865 Interest rate spread(5)1.47 %1.57 %2.09 %Net interest margin(6)1.88 %1.94 %2.34 %Ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities1.151.151.16________________________________________(1)Loans held-for-sale and non-accruing loans have been included in loans receivable and the effect of such inclusion was not material.

The provision for credit losses decreased by $3.9 million to $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2025 was largely attributable to charge-offs, loan growth, and increased reserves on individually evaluated loans. The provision for credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2024 was largely attributable to charge-offs of three related commercial real estate loans and the charge-off of one non-performing commercial and industrial loan relationship.Additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses and the associated provision recognized during the year ended June 30, 2025 is presented under “Item 1, Business” on this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased from a $1.9 million loss for the year ended June 30, 2024 to income of $19.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, an improvement of $21.0 million. There were no gains on sale and call of securities during the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to a loss of $18.1 million recorded in the prior year. The loss in the prior year was due to the repositioning of our investment securities portfolio that involved the sale of $122.2 million of available for sale debt securities in December 2023.Gain on sale of loans was $806,000 for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to a loss of $282,000 during the prior year. The loss in the prior year was primarily the result of the sale of three related nonperforming commercial real estate loans held-for-sale.We recognized a non-recurring loss of $974,000 attributable to the write-down of one other real estate owned (“OREO”) property during the prior year, while there were no such losses recorded in the current year.Income from bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) increased $1.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. The increase primarily reflected improved income as a result of the BOLI restructure initiated in December 2023, and the absence of non-recurring exchange charges related to the restructure recorded in the prior year.48Table of ContentsThe remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items.Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense decreased by $94.5 million to $120.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 from $215.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, driven by the absence of a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment of $97.4 million recognized in the prior year period. Excluding the goodwill impairment, non-interest expense increased $2.9 million compared to the prior year period.Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $1.7 million to $70.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, primarily driven by an increase in salary and benefits expense attributable to annual merit increases and higher incentive compensation.Net occupancy expense of premises increased by $491,000 to $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily driven by higher snow removal expenses due to abnormally harsh winter conditions.Equipment and systems expense increased $480,000 to $15.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. This increase was largely attributable to increases in technology expense associated with the Company’s ongoing digital banking initiatives.Advertising and marketing expense increased $481,000 to $1.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. This increase in advertising expense was largely driven by an increase in digital and online advertising campaigns to support our deposit growth initiatives.The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items.Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased by $1.0 million to $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, from $5.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by the absence of a $5.7 million tax expense related to the surrender of BOLI policies in the prior year period, partially offset by higher pre-tax income in the current year period.Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023A comparison of our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024. Liquidity and Commitments Liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and securities. Liquidity, at June 30, 2025, included $167.3 million of short-term cash and equivalents and $1.01 billion of investment securities available for sale which can readily be sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we have the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB, FRB or via unsecured overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2025, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $695.0 million and $1.19 billion from the FHLB and FRB, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. We had the ability to pledge additional securities to borrow an additional $337.3 million at June 30, 2025. As of that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling $845.0 million, of which none was outstanding. Deposits increased $517.1 million to $5.68 billion at June 30, 2025 from $5.16 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $533.4 million increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $16.3 million decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits. Borrowings from the FHLB and other sources are generally available to supplement our liquidity position or to replace maturing deposits. As of June 30, 2025, our outstanding balance of FHLB advances, excluding fair value adjustments, totaled $1.11 billion. As of the same date, we had $150.0 million outstanding via our overnight line of credit with the FHLB.49Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our short-term borrowings at and for the periods shown: At or For the Years Ended June 30,202520242023(Dollars in Thousands)Balance at end of year$1,050,000 $1,400,000 $1,175,000 Average balance during year$1,024,959 $1,314,686 $900,997 Maximum outstanding at any month end$1,425,000 $1,490,000 $1,280,000 Weighted average interest rate at end of year4.46 %5.47 %5.42 %Weighted average interest rate during year4.88 %5.52 %4.49 %The following table discloses our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2025: June 30, 2025Less thanOne YearOne toThree YearsOver ThreeYears toFive YearsOver FiveYearsTotal(In Thousands)Contractual obligationsOperating lease obligations$3,480 $5,797 $3,008 $1,783 $14,068 Certificates of deposit1,911,408 51,627 8,175 5,364 1,976,574 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances906,500 200,000 — — 1,106,500 Total contractual obligations$2,821,388 $257,424 $11,183 $7,147 $3,097,142 CommitmentsUndisbursed funds from approved lines of credit(1)$74,076 $24,153 $4,116 $74,779 $177,124 Construction loans in process(1)39,235 76,416 — — 115,651 Other commitments to extend credit(1)26,364 — — — 26,364 Total commitments$139,675 $100,569 $4,116 $74,779 $319,139 ________________________________________(1)Represents amounts committed to customers.In addition to the loan commitments noted above, the pipeline of loans held for sale included $11.1 million of in process loans whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. In addition to the commitments noted above, we are party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $160,000 at June 30, 2025 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.At June 30, 2025, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $319.1 million compared to $280.9 million at June 30, 2024. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2025, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.50Table of ContentsCapitalConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskManagement of Interest Rate Risk and Market Risk The majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a significant form of market risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates and arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. We maintain an Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”) program in order to manage our interest rate risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee, which has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which is comprised of various members of the senior and executive management team.51Table of ContentsThe quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income (“NII”) that we recognize. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario.With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The degree to which our EVE changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of our sensitivity to interest rate risk. For both earnings and capital at risk our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates.The following tables present the results of our internal EVE and NII analyses as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively: June 30, 20251 to 12 Months13 to 24 MonthsChange inInterest Rates$ Amountof EVE% Changein EVE$ Amountof NII% Changein NII$ Amountof NII% Changein NII(Dollars in Thousands)+300 bps404,295 (37.02)%147,989 (6.79)%161,747 (8.17)%+200 bps475,744 (25.89)%150,539 (5.18)%165,520 (6.03)%+100 bps555,065 (13.54)%153,195 (3.51)%169,510 (3.77)%0 bps641,985 — 158,762 — 176,142 — -100 bps728,863 13.53 %162,406 2.30 %181,671 3.14 %-200 bps785,464 22.35 %165,502 4.25 %184,695 4.86 %-300 bps852,184 32.74 %168,238 5.97 %185,248 5.17 %June 30, 20241 to 12 Months13 to 24 MonthsChange inInterest Rates$ Amountof EVE% Changein EVE$ Amountof NII% Changein NII$ Amountof NII% Changein NII(Dollars in Thousands)+300 bps331,842 (41.07)%127,382 (8.51)%135,753 (10.66)%+200 bps400,548 (28.87)%131,003 (5.91)%140,351 (7.64)%+100 bps483,724 (14.10)%135,289 (2.83)%146,594 (3.53)%0 bps563,098 — 139,236 — 151,955 — -100 bps640,024 13.66 %144,991 4.13 %157,821 3.86 %-200 bps693,495 23.16 %148,189 6.43 %159,928 5.25 %-300 bps767,451 36.29 %150,478 8.07 %160,093 5.36 %There are numerous internal and external factors that may contribute to changes in our EVE and its sensitivity. Changes in the composition and allocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also 52Table of Contentsalter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values thereof.Notwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set forth above. Additionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.Item 8.

Form 10-K SummaryNot applicable.59Table of ContentsAugust 21, 2025Management Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe management of Kearny Financial Corp. and Subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements.The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of June 30, 2025, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effective operation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, a copy of which is included in this annual report./s/ Craig L.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.F-2Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Allowance for Credit Losses – Qualitative Factors:
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. ASC 326 requires the measurement of expected lifetime credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost at the reporting date. As of June 30, 2025, the balance of the allowance for credit losses on loans was $46.2 million.Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors involves pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. Pooled loan portfolio segments include multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, commercial business, construction, one-to-four family residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans.For pooled loans, the Company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The DCF methodology combines the probability of default, the loss given default, remaining life of the loan and prepayment and curtailment speed assumptions to estimate a reserve for each loan. The loss rates are adjusted by current and forecasted macroeconomic assumptions and return to the mean after the forecasted periods. These quantitative factors are supplemented by qualitative factors reflecting management’s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. Qualitative factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts determined by correlation of credit stress to the maximum loss factors of a peer group’s historical charge-offs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the Company’s financial results. We identified auditing the qualitative component of the ACL on pooled loans in the multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, and one-to-four family residential mortgage loan segments as a critical audit matter because the methodology to determine the estimate of credit losses uses subjective judgments by management and is subject to material variability. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative factors on the multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, and one-to-four family residential mortgage loan segments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel including the use of internal specialists.The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:•Testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the ACL on pooled loans, including controls addressing:◦Methodology and accounting policies.◦Data inputs, judgments and calculations used to determine the qualitative factors.◦Information technology general controls and application controls.◦Management’s review of the qualitative factors.•Substantively testing management’s process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for developing the ACL on loans collectively evaluated for impairment, which included:◦Evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company’s methodology and accounting policies involved in the application of ASC 326.◦Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.◦Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation including utilizing internal specialists to assist in testing the accuracy of the underlying peer data used to develop the maximum loss factors.F-3Table of Contents◦Evaluation of the reasonableness of management’s judgments related to qualitative factors to determine if they are calculated to conform with management’s policies and were consistently applied period over period. Our evaluation considered evidence from internal and external sources and loan portfolio composition and performance.Goodwill Impairment: As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $113.5 million as of June 30, 2025, which is allocated to the Company’s single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performed its annual quantitative assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. The annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Company’s single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The result of the income approach was weighted at 70% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 30% in determining the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit. The fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value, resulting in no goodwill impairment for the year ended June 30, 2025.The goodwill impairment assessment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of management judgment.We identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Company as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for this determination were the degree of auditor judgment in performing procedures over the key assumptions, which include discount rate, cost savings rate, expected future cash flows, and control premium.The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:•Testing the effectiveness of controls over the valuation methodologies, assumptions and data used to estimate the fair value of the Company, including controls addressing:◦Management’s review of the reasonableness and accuracy of the Company’s expected future cash flows used in the income approach.◦Management’s evaluation of assumptions and inputs used, including discount rate, cost savings rate, control premium, and comparable companies data used to determine fair value.◦Completeness and accuracy of key financial data used in the assessment.•Substantively testing management’s estimate, for estimating the fair value of the Company, which included:◦Testing of key financial data for completeness and accuracy.◦Evaluation of management’s ability to reasonably forecast cash flows.◦Utilization of an internal specialist to evaluate appropriateness of valuation methodologies, the discount rate assumption, cost savings rate, control premium, comparable companies data, and overall reasonableness of the fair value./s/ Crowe LLPWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Consolidated Financial Statement PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kearny Financial Corp. (the “Company”), its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Company, 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC and Kearny Wealth Management LLC. The Company conducts its business principally through the Bank. Management prepared the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), including the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions during consolidation.In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.Business of the Company and SubsidiariesThe Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of the Bank. The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using those deposits, together with other funds, to originate or purchase loans for its portfolio and invest in securities. Loans originated or purchased by the Bank generally include loans collateralized by residential and commercial real estate augmented by secured and unsecured loans to businesses and consumers. The investment securities purchased by the Bank generally include U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government and agency debentures, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and subordinated debt.At June 30, 2025, the Bank had three wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Company, 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC and Kearny Wealth Management LLC. CJB Investment Company was organized under New Jersey law as a New Jersey Investment Company and remained active through the three-year period ended June 30, 2025. 189-245 Berdan Avenue LLC was formed during the year ended June 30, 2023 for the purpose of ownership and operation of commercial real estate. In February 2024, the Bank formed the Kearny Wealth Management LLC subsidiary for the purpose of providing wealth management and insurance brokerage services via a third-party service provider.Subsequent EventsThe Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of June 30, 2025, for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date this document was filed.On July 24, 2025, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable on August 26, 2025, to stockholders of record as of August 12, 2025.Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash, deposits with other financial institutions with maturities fewer than 90 days, and federal funds sold. Net cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions, interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and borrowings with original maturities fewer than 90 days. SecuritiesThe Company classifies its investment securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The Company does not use or maintain a trading account. Investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost. Investment securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized holding gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) component of stockholders’ equity.Premiums on callable securities are amortized to the earliest call date whereas discounts on such securities are accreted to the maturity date utilizing the level-yield method. Premiums and discounts on all other securities are generally amortized or accreted to the maturity date utilizing the level-yield method taking into consideration the impact of principal F-12Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)amortization and prepayments, as applicable. Gain or loss on sales of securities is based on the specific identification method.Pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326, for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more than likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities available for sale that do not meet the above criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating by a rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Under ASC 326, changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available for sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on available for sale securities totaled $6.6 million and $8.5 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses.Management measures expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type. Accrued interest receivable on held to maturity securities totaled $376,000 and $447,000 at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses.Concentration of Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company and its subsidiaries to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans receivable. Cash and cash equivalents include deposits placed in other financial institutions.Securities include concentrations of investments backed by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”).The Company’s lending activity is primarily concentrated in loans collateralized by real estate in the states of New Jersey and New York. As a result, credit risk is broadly dependent on the real estate market and general economic conditions in these states. Additionally, the Company’s lending policies limit the amount of credit extended to any single borrower and their related interests thereby limiting the concentration of credit risk to any single borrower.Loans ReceivableLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at unpaid principal balances, net of deferred loan origination fees and costs, purchase discounts and premiums, purchase accounting fair value adjustments and the allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Certain direct loan origination costs, net of loan origination fees, are deferred and amortized, using the level-yield method, as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans. Unearned premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted utilizing the level-yield method over the contractual lives of the related loans. Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled $21.1 million and $20.5 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses.F-13Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)Loans Held-for-SaleLoans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on an aggregate basis. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized in a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings. Premiums and discounts and origination fees and costs on loans held-for-sale are deferred and recognized as a component of the gain or loss on sale. Gains and losses on sales of loans held-for-sale are recognized on settlement dates and are determined by the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the loans. These transactions are accounted for as sales based on satisfaction of the criteria for such accounting which provide that, as transferor, control over the loans have been surrendered.Past Due LoansA loan’s past due status is generally determined based upon its principal and interest (“P&I”) payment delinquency status in conjunction with its past maturity status, where applicable. A loan’s P&I payment delinquency status is based upon the number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P&I payment due and the as of measurement date. A loan’s past maturity status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan’s contractual maturity date and the as of measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following past due tiers for financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days), 30-59 days, 60-89 days and 90 or more days.Nonaccrual LoansLoans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when the Company does not expect to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 day past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan.Classification of Assets In compliance with the regulatory guidelines, the Company’s loan review system includes an evaluation process through which certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified as Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful or Loss.An asset is classified as Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified as Loss are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.Assets which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses are designated as Special Mention by management. Assets designated as Substandard or Doubtful are generally referred to as Classified Assets. Non-classified assets are internally rated within one of four Pass categories or as Watch with the latter denoting a potential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by management until remediated.Management generally performs a classification of assets review, including the regulatory classification of assets, on an ongoing basis. The results of the classification of assets review are validated by the Company’s third party loan review firm during their quarterly independent review. In the event of a difference in rating or classification between those assigned by the internal and external resources, the Company will generally utilize the more critical or conservative rating or classification. Final loan ratings and regulatory classifications are presented monthly to the Board of Directors and are reviewed by regulators during the examination process.F-14Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)Allowance for Credit Losses Pursuant to ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to loans receivable and securities measured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of credit. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is reported separately as a contra-asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments and unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in other liabilities while the provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments is reported in other non-interest expense.Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans ReceivableThe allowance for credit losses on loans is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the loan to present the net amount expected to be collected. Expected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective, or pooled, basis for those loans which share similar risk characteristics. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether loans within a pool continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan change, such that they are no longer similar to other loans in the pool, the Company will evaluate the loan with a different pool of loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. The Company evaluates the pooling methodology at least annually. Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when the Company believes the balances to be uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off.The Company has chosen to segment its portfolio consistent with the manner in which it manages credit risk. Such segments include multi-family mortgage, nonresidential mortgage, commercial business, construction, one- to four-family residential mortgage, home equity and consumer. For most segments the Company calculates estimated credit losses using a probability of default and loss given default methodology, the results of which are applied to the aggregated discounted cash flow of each individual loan within the segment. The point in time probability of default and loss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses on loans via a quantitative analysis which considers relevant available information from internal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party economic forecasts, industry trends and other available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to the historical average economic variables. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.Also included in the allowance for credit losses on loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors that the Company considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and non-accrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the most severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks.Individually Evaluated LoansOn a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected F-15Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan.Acquired LoansAcquired loans are included in the Company's calculation of the allowance for credit losses. How the allowance on an acquired loan is recorded depends on whether or not it has been classified as a Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) loan. PCD loans are loans acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. PCD loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 326-20 and are initially recorded at fair value as determined by the sum of the present value of expected future cash flows and an allowance for credit losses at acquisition. The allowance for PCD loans is recorded through a gross-up effect, while the allowance for acquired non-PCD loans is recorded through provision expense, consistent with originated loans. Thus, the determination of which loans are PCD and non-PCD can have a significant impact on the accounting for these loans. Subsequent to acquisition, the allowance for PCD loans will generally follow the same estimation, provision and charge-off process as non-PCD acquired and originated loans.Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet CommitmentsThe Company is required to include unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded in the future within the allowance calculation, other than those that are unconditionally cancelable. To arrive at that reserve, the reserve percentage for each applicable segment is applied to the unused portion of the expected commitment balance and is multiplied by the expected funding rate. To determine the expected funding rate, the Company uses a historical utilization rate for each segment. As noted above, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the related credit expense is recorded in other non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Loan ModificationsUnder ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), the Company assesses all loan modifications to determine whether one is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, regardless of whether the modified loan terms include a concession. Modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, principal forgiveness or a combination thereof.All modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are placed on nonaccrual status for a period of no less than six months after modification. Modified loans may be returned to accrual status and a non-adverse classification if (1) the borrower has paid timely P&I payments in accordance with the terms of the modified loan agreement for no less than six consecutive months after modification due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, and (2) the Company expects to receive all P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the modified loan agreement.Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost. Office buildings, leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Office buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the respective leases or lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.Construction in progress primarily represents facilities under construction for future use in our business and includes all costs to acquire land and construct buildings, as well as capitalized interest during the construction period. Interest is capitalized at the Company’s average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed AssetsProperties and other assets acquired through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or repossession are carried at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs. The estimated fair value of real estate property and other repossessed F-16Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)assets is generally based on independent appraisals. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Thereafter, decreases in the properties’ estimated fair value are charged to income along with any additional property maintenance and protection expenses incurred in owning the properties.Federal Home Loan Bank StockFederal law requires a member institution of the FHLB system to hold restricted stock of its district FHLB according to a predetermined formula. The restricted stock is carried at cost, less any applicable impairment. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.In assessing impairment, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of such events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company would not be required to perform a quantitative impairment test.For the year ended June 30, 2025, the annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (“income approach”) and estimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The income approach measures the fair value of an interest in a business by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. The market approaches take into consideration fair values of comparable companies operating in similar lines of business that are potentially subject to similar economic and environmental factors and could be considered reasonable investment alternatives. The result of the income approach was weighted at 70% and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 30% in determining the fair value of our single reporting unit. The results of the annual quantitative impairment analysis indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for our single reporting unit.No impairment charges were required to be recorded for the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2024, a pre-tax goodwill impairment of $97.4 million was required to be recorded as a non-cash expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for additional information.The balance of other intangible assets at June 30, 2025 and 2024 totaled $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, representing the remaining unamortized balance of the core deposit intangibles ascribed to the value of deposits acquired by the Bank through the acquisition of Clifton Bancorp Inc. in April 2018 and MSB Financial Corp. in July 2020.Bank Owned Life InsuranceBank owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its net realizable value. The change in the net asset value is recorded as a component of non-interest income. A deferred liability has been recorded for the estimated cost of postretirement life insurance benefits accruing to applicable employees and directors covered by an endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Transfers of Financial AssetsTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company - put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange F-17Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.Income TaxesThe Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns. Federal income taxes are allocated to each entity based on their respective contributions to the taxable income of the consolidated income tax returns. Separate state income tax returns are filed for the Company and its subsidiaries on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis as required by the jurisdiction. The federal income tax rate of 21% was applicable for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Federal and state income taxes have been provided on the basis of the Company’s income or loss as reported in accordance with GAAP. The amounts reflected on the Company’s state and federal income tax returns differ from these provisions due principally to temporary differences in the reporting of certain items for financial statement reporting and income tax reporting purposes. The tax effect of these temporary differences is accounted for as deferred taxes applicable to future periods. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is determined by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance provided for the full amount which is not more likely than not to be realized.The Company identified no significant income tax uncertainties through the evaluation of its income tax positions as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. Therefore, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits as of those dates. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The Company recognized no material interest and penalties during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 or 2023. The tax years subject to examination by the taxing authorities are the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.Retirement Plans Pension expense is the net of service and interest cost, return on plan assets and amortization of gains and losses not immediately recognized. Employee 401(k) and profit sharing plan expense is the amount of matching contributions. Deferred compensation plan expense allocates the benefits over years of service.Employee Stock Ownership PlanThe cost of shares issued to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”), but not yet allocated to participants, is shown as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are committed to be released to participant accounts. Dividends on allocated and unallocated ESOP shares either reduce retained earnings or reduce debt and accrued interest as determined by the ESOP Plan Administrator.Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items recorded in equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and amortization related to post-retirement obligations. Comprehensive income is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Loss Contingencies Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there now are such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.F-18Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)Loan Commitments and Related Financial InstrumentsFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. (See Note 16, Commitments, for additional information).Derivatives and Hedging The Company utilizes derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps, caps and floors to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in conjunction with its overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting requirements, the Company formally designates all of its hedging relationships as either fair value hedges, intended to offset the changes in the value of certain financial instruments due to movements in interest rates, or cash flow hedges, intended to offset changes in the cash flows of certain financial instruments due to movement in interest rates, and documents the strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions, and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their fair values. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge on the Company’s wholesale funding position, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge on the Company’s assets, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company’s hedged variable rate assets. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.Derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment only if they are designated as such on the date on which the derivative contract is entered and are expected to be, and are, effective in substantially reducing interest rate risk arising from the assets and liabilities identified as exposing the Company to risk. Those derivative financial instruments that do not meet the hedging criteria discussed below would be classified as undesignated derivatives and would be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income.The Company discontinues hedge accounting when (a) it determines that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of a hedged item; (b) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (c) probability exists that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur; or (d) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. In all cases in which hedge accounting is discontinued and a derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements, recognizing changes in fair value in current period income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company takes into account the impact of collateral and master netting agreements that allow it to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. As a result, the Company’s Statements of Financial Condition could reflect derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets, and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities.The Company’s interest rate derivatives are comprised of interest rate swaps, caps, and floors hedging variable rate wholesale funding and floating-rate available for sale securities, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The carrying value of interest rate derivatives is included in the balance of other assets or other liabilities and comprises the remaining unamortized cost of interest rate caps and the cumulative changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives. Such changes in fair value are offset against accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income tax.In general, the cash flows received and/or exchanged with counterparties for those derivatives qualifying as interest rate hedges are generally classified in the financial statements in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged.F-19Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)Interest differentials paid or received under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss. In the event of default by a counter party, the risk in these transactions is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates.Net Income per Common Share (“EPS”)Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding adjusted for the ESOP shares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options or restricted stock units, were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts or securities exercisable or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. Shares issued and reacquired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 17, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.Operating SegmentsPublic companies are required to report certain financial information about significant revenue-producing segments of the business for which such information is available and utilized by the chief operating decision makers. Substantially all of the Company’s operations occur through the Bank and involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers. The Company’s executive management, which includes the President and Chief Executive Officer who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and evaluates financial performance based upon analysis of the Company as one reportable operating segment. All of the Company’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on the manner in which it supports the other activities of the Company.The CODM is provided with the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition and operations and evaluates the Company’s operating results based on consolidated net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense, and net income, which are reported on the consolidated statement of operations. These results are used to benchmark the Company against its competitors. Other significant non-cash items assessed by the CODM are depreciation, amortization and provision for credit losses consistent with the reporting on the consolidated statements of cash flows.Effective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), which did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.Stock Compensation Plans Compensation expense related to stock options, non-vested stock awards and non-vested stock units is based on the fair value of the award on the measurement date with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of non-vested stock awards and stock units is generally the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.Advertising and Marketing ExpensesThe Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as incurred.F-20Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2 – Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires reporting companies to improve the transparency of certain income tax related disclosures, including the rate reconciliation and taxes paid disclosures. For public companies, the requirements will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, to improve financial reporting by requiring that public business entities disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. Additionally, entities must disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity's definition of selling expenses.In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date.
This ASU amends the effective date of ASU 2024-03 to clarify that all public business entities are required to adopt the guidance in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of ASU 2024-03 and ASU 2025-01 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.Adoption of New Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), to improve reportable segment disclosures by requiring public entities to disclose significant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment, where significant expense categories are defined as those that are regularly reported to an entity’s chief operating decision-maker and included in a segment’s reported measures of profit or loss.The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. As the Company has only one reportable segment, the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.F-21Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3 - Securities (continued)Available for sale securities are evaluated to determine if a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or from other factors. An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) if management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at June 30, 2025. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. No allowance for credit losses was recorded at June 30, 2025 on available for sale securities.The sales of available for sale securities during the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, were part of wholesale restructurings and the proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding securities. The Company was not required to sell these securities. There were no sales of securities during the year ended June 30, 2025.At June 30, 2025, the held to maturity securities portfolio consisted of agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions. The mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The obligations of state and political subdivisions in the portfolio are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The Company regularly monitors the obligations of state and political subdivisions sector of the market and reviews collectability including such factors as the financial condition of the issuers as well as credit ratings in effect as of the reporting period. No allowance for credit losses was recorded at June 30, 2025 on held to maturity securities.As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no holdings of debt securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.F-26Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Loans that become 90 days past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining P&I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan.

The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:Pass – Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.Special Mention – Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses.Substandard – Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4 – Loans Receivable (continued)Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) LoansPCD loans are acquired loans that, as of the acquisition date, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Non-PCD loans are acquired loans that have experienced no or insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. To distinguish between the two types of acquired loans, the Company evaluates risk characteristics that have been determined to be indicators of deteriorated credit quality. The determining criteria may involve loan specific characteristics such as payment status, debt service coverage or other changes in creditworthiness since the loan was originated, while others are relevant to recent economic conditions, such as borrowers in industries impacted by the pandemic.As of June 30, 2025, the carrying amount of PCD loans was $12.7 million, with an associated allowance for credit losses of $175,000, compared to a carrying amount of $15.7 million and an allowance for credit losses of $141,000 as of June 30, 2024.Residential Mortgage Loans in ForeclosureThe Company may obtain physical possession of one- to four-family real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan or nonresidential real estate collateralizing a nonresidential mortgage loan via foreclosure or through an in-substance repossession. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company held no nonresidential property in other real estate owned that was acquired through foreclosure on a nonresidential mortgage loan. As of the same dates, the Company held three residential mortgage loans with aggregate carrying values totaling $2.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and six commercial mortgage loans with aggregate carrying values totaling $23.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively, which were in the process of foreclosure.F-34Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 11 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesRisk Management Objective of Using DerivativesThe Company uses various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to specific wholesale funding positions and assets. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Financial ConditionThe tables below present the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Statement of Financial Condition as of June 30, 2025 and 2024:June 30, 2025Asset DerivativesLiability DerivativesLocationFair ValueLocationFair Value(In Thousands)Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:Interest rate contractsOther assets$16,745 Other liabilities$5,149 Total$16,745 $5,149 June 30, 2024Asset DerivativesLiability DerivativesLocationFair ValueLocationFair Value(In Thousands)Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:Interest rate contractsOther assets$54,362 Other liabilities$— Total$54,362 $— Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate RiskThe Company uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate products are designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had a total of 15 interest rate swaps, caps and collars with a total notional amount of $1.75 billion hedging specific wholesale funding positions and five interest rate floors with a notional amount of $550.0 million hedging floating-rate available for sale securities.For cash flow hedges on the Company's wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s hedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company reclassified $26.5 million as a reduction in interest expense. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that $12.6 million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest expense.For cash flow hedges on the Company’s securities, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company’s hedged variable rate assets. During the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company reclassified a loss of $57,000 to interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $216,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest income.F-42Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had five interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $775.0 million hedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans.For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.

ESOPIn conjunction to the Company’s initial public stock offering in February 2005, the Bank established an ESOP for all eligible employees. The ESOP purchased 2,409,764 shares of Company’s common stock with proceeds of a loan from the Company to the ESOP. In connection with the completion of the Company’s mutual to stock conversion in May 2015, the ESOP purchased an additional 3,612,500 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $10.00 per share with the proceeds of a new loan from the Company to the ESOP. The Company refinanced the outstanding principal and interest balance of $3.8 million and borrowed an additional $36.1 million to purchase the additional shares. The Company makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP equaling principal and interest payments owed on the ESOP’s loan to the Company. Such payments may be reduced by the amount of dividends paid on shares of the Company’s common stock held by the ESOP. The outstanding loan principal balance at June 30, 2025 was $22.6 million.ESOP shares pledged as collateral are initially recorded as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. ESOP compensation expense was approximately $5.3 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing the fair value of shares allocated or committed to be released during the year.At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the ESOP shares were as follows:June 30,20252024(In Thousands)Shares purchased by ESOP6,022 6,022 Less: Shares allocated3,965 3,764 Less: Shares committed to be released100 100 Remaining unearned ESOP shares1,957 2,158 Fair value of unearned ESOP shares$12,642 $13,272 F-45Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

The Bank will contribute a matching contribution up to 3.5% of an eligible employee’s salary deferral contribution, provided the eligible employee has contributed 6%. The Plan expense amounted to approximately $1.5 million, $1.4 million and $1.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.Multi-Employer Retirement PlanThe Bank participates in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (“The Pentegra DB Plan”), a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan. The Pentegra DB Plan’s Employer Identification Number is 13-5645888 and the Plan Number is 001. The Pentegra DB Plan operates as a multi-employer plan for accounting purposes and as a multiple-employer plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the IRC. There are no collective bargaining agreements in place that require contributions to the Pentegra DB Plan.The Pentegra DB Plan is a single plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c) and, as a result, all of the assets stand behind all of the liabilities. Accordingly, under the Pentegra DB Plan contributions made by a participating employer may be used to provide benefits to participants of other participating employers.The Pentegra DB Plan is non-contributory and covers all eligible employees. In April 2007, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved, effective July 1, 2007, freezing all future benefit accruals under the Pentegra DB Plan.Funded status (market value of plan assets divided by funding target) of the Pentegra DB Plan based on valuation reports as of July 1, 2024 and 2023 was 97.94% and 98.87%, respectively. Total contributions, made to the Pentegra DB Plan, which include contributions from all participating employers and not just the Company, as reported on Form 5500, were $63.4 million and $151.8 million for the plan years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The 2021 Plan authorized the issuance of up to 7,500,000 shares (the “Share Limit”); provided, however that the Share Limit is reduced, on a one-for-one-basis, for each share of common stock subject to a stock option grant, and on a three-for-one basis for each share of common stock issued pursuant to restricted stock awards or RSUs. During the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company granted 380,007 RSUs (comprised of 278,530 service-based RSUs and 101,477 performance-based RSUs) and 349,257 RSUs (comprised of 255,062 service-based RSUs and 94,195 performance-based RSUs), respectively. The service-based RSUs generally vest in three tranches over a period of 3.0 years and the performance-based RSUs will cliff vest upon the achievement of performance measures over a three-year period. The total number of performance-based RSUs that will vest, if any, will depend on whether and to what extent the performance measures are achieved. Common stock will be issued from authorized shares upon the vesting of the RSUs. At June 30, 2025, there were 3,586,839 shares remaining available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or RSUs under the 2021 Plan, subject to the limitations noted above.Kearny Financial Corp. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (“2016 Plan”)No grants were made under the 2016 Plan during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. As of October 28, 2021, the 2016 Plan was frozen and the Company no longer makes grants under the 2016 Plan.Stock options granted under the 2016 Plan vest in equal installments over a five-year service period. Stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price and have an expiration period of 10 years. No stock options were granted during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023.There were no restricted stock awards granted during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023.

Restricted StockRestricted shares awarded under the 2016 Plan generally vest in equal installments over a five-year service period. In addition to the requisite service period, the vesting of certain restricted shares awarded to management are also conditioned upon the achievement of one or more objective performance factors established by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. In accordance with the terms of the 2016 Plan, such factors may be based on the performance of the Company as a whole or on any one or more business units of the Company or its subsidiaries. Performance factors may be measured relative to a peer group, an index or certain financial targets established in the Company's strategic business plan and budget.The Company fully achieved the applicable performance targets for fiscal 2024 and therefore all eligible performance-based restricted shares successfully vested during the year ended June 30, 2025.The performance factors and underlying cost basis of the remaining unvested performance-based restricted shares are generally expected to be determined annually concurrent with the anniversary date of the original grants.For service based awards management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 14 – Stockholders’ Equity Regulatory CapitalThe Bank and the Company are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and consolidated Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their respective assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s and consolidated Company’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors.The minimum capital level requirements applicable to both the Bank and the consolidated Company include: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The Bank and the consolidated Company are also required to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital ratios which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the regulatory capital ratios, of both the Company and the Bank were in excess of the levels required by federal banking regulators to be classified as “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.The following tables present information regarding the Bank’s regulatory capital levels at June 30, 2025 and 2024:At June 30, 2025ActualFor CapitalAdequacy PurposesTo Be Well CapitalizedUnder PromptCorrective ActionProvisionsAmountRatioAmountRatioAmountRatio(Dollars in Thousands)Total capital (to risk-weighted assets)$704,969 14.49 %$389,184 8.00 %$486,481 10.00 %Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)662,232 13.61 %291,888 6.00 %389,184 8.00 %Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)662,232 13.61 %218,916 4.50 %316,212 6.50 %Tier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets)662,232 8.68 %305,162 4.00 %381,453 5.00 %At June 30, 2024ActualFor CapitalAdequacy PurposesTo Be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective ActionProvisionsAmountRatioAmountRatioAmountRatio(Dollars in Thousands)Total capital (to risk-weighted assets)$688,597 14.42 %$382,034 8.00 %$477,542 10.00 %Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)651,620 13.65 %286,525 6.00 %382,034 8.00 %Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)651,620 13.65 %214,894 4.50 %310,402 6.50 %Tier 1 capital (to adjusted total assets)651,620 8.44 %308,656 4.00 %385,820 5.00 %F-57Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file an application or a notice with federal banking regulators at least 30 days before making a capital distribution. A savings institution must file an application for prior approval of a capital distribution if: (i) it is not eligible for expedited treatment under the applications processing rules of federal banking regulators; (ii) the total amount of all capital distributions, including the proposed capital distribution, for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the savings institution’s net income for that year to date plus the institution’s retained net income for the preceding two years; (iii) it would not adequately be capitalized after the capital distribution; or (iv) the distribution would violate an agreement with federal banking regulators or applicable regulations. Federal banking regulators may disapprove a notice or deny an application for a capital distribution if: (i) the savings institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, an application for quarterly capital distributions from the Bank to the Company was approved by federal banking regulators. The amount of dividends payable is based on 85% of quarterly net income of the Bank.During the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, in conjunction with quarterly capital distributions, as discussed above, totaled $16.8 million, $19.3 million and $26.3 million, respectively.Stock Repurchase PlansDuring the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock.F-58Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Retained earnings at June 30, 2025, includes approximately $38.4 million of bad debt allowance, pursuant to the IRC, for which income taxes have not been provided. If such amount is used for purposes other than to absorb bad debts, including distributions in liquidation, it will be subject to income tax at the then current rate.A tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation process, if any. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of F-59Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 15 – Income Taxes (continued)whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment.Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryover period. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. Based on its assessments as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company determined it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized.The tax effects of existing temporary differences that give rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows: June 30,20252024(In Thousands)Deferred income tax assets:Purchase accounting$3,140 $3,543 Accumulated other comprehensive incomeUnrealized loss on securities available for sale32,542 37,683 Allowance for credit losses13,161 12,786 Benefit plans2,596 2,605 Compensation1,268 1,303 Stock-based compensation2,689 2,923 Uncollected interest1,581 1,177 Depreciation2,634 2,309 Net operating loss carryover1,522 889 Capital loss carryforward703 614 Other items643 780 62,479 66,612 Deferred income tax liabilities:Deferred loan fees and costs1,756 1,690 Accumulated other comprehensive incomeDerivatives2,844 12,085 Defined benefit plans276 98 Goodwill2,400 2,400 7,276 16,273 Net deferred income tax asset$55,203 $50,339 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of the state of New Jersey and various other states.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 16 – CommitmentsThe Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit. These transactions involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had $319.1 million and $280.9 million in commitments to originate loans, including unused lines of credit.The Bank is party to standby letters of credit through which it guarantees certain specific business obligations of its commercial customers. The balance of standby letters of credit at June 30, 2025 and 2024 was approximately $160,000 for each period.In addition to the commitments noted above, at June 30, 2025, the Company’s pipeline of loans held for sale included $11.1 million of in-process loans whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. The Company and its subsidiaries are also party to litigation which arises primarily in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of such litigation should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.Note 17 – Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1:Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2:Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, market data by correlation or other means. Level 3:Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.F-61Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 17 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)Assets Measured on a Recurring Basis:The following methods and significant assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2025 and 2024:Investment Securities Available for Sale The Company’s available for sale investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the securities’ terms and conditions, among other things. From time to time, the Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from third-party sources or derived using internal models.Derivatives The Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest rate derivatives to determine the fair value of its interest rate caps and swaps. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate derivatives such as discounted cash flow analysis and extensions of the Black-Scholes model. Such valuations are based upon readily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations by the Company.Those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:June 30, 2025QuotedPricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1)SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)Total(In Thousands)Assets:Debt securities available for sale:Asset-backed securities$— $59,498 $— $59,498 Collateralized loan obligations— 323,245 — 323,245 Corporate bonds— 140,117 — 140,117 Total debt securities— 522,860 — 522,860 Mortgage-backed securities available for sale:Residential pass-through securities— 357,319 — 357,319 Commercial pass-through securities— 132,790 — 132,790 Total mortgage-backed securities— 490,109 — 490,109 Total securities available for sale$— $1,012,969 $— $1,012,969 Interest rate contracts$— $16,745 $— $16,745 Total assets$— $1,029,714 $— $1,029,714 Liabilities:Interest rate contracts$— $5,149 $— $5,149 Total liabilities$— $5,149 $— $5,149 F-62Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business assets. Management may also adjust appraised values to reflect estimated changes in market values or apply other adjustments to appraised values resulting from its knowledge of the collateral. Internal valuations may be utilized to determine the fair value of other business assets. For non-collateral-dependent loans, management estimates fair value using discounted cash flows based on inputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management’s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant would in pricing such loans. Individually analyzed collateral dependent loans are considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company.Those assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:June 30, 2025Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1)SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)Total(In Thousands)Collateral dependent loans:Multi-family mortgage$— $— $16,385 $16,385 Nonresidential mortgage— — 4,697 4,697 Total$— $— $21,082 $21,082 F-63Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

By comparison, at June 30, 2024, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balance totaling $7.4 million and valuation allowances of $508,000 reflecting an aggregate fair value of $6.9 million.Once a loan is foreclosed, the fair value of the other real estate owned continues to be evaluated based upon the fair value of the repossessed real estate originally securing the loan. At June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company had no other real estate owned assets, respectively.F-64Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans held in portfolio or loans held for sale is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to loans held for sale that are considered derivative instruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure.Limitations. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.The fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.Finally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.F-66Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 19 – Revenue RecognitionAll of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606 is recognized within noninterest income. The following table presents the Company’s sources of noninterest income for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Sources of revenue outside the scope of ASC 606 are noted as such.Years Ended June 30,202520242023(In Thousands) Non-interest income:Deposit-related fees and charges$1,866 $1,772 $1,881 Loan-related fees and charges (1)624 837 1,225 Loss on sale and call of securities (1)— (18,135)(15,227)Gain (loss) on sale of loans (1)806 (282)(1,645)Loss on sale of other real estate owned— (974)(139)Income from bank owned life insurance (1)10,672 9,076 8,645 Electronic banking fees and charges (interchange income)1,717 2,357 1,759 Miscellaneous (1)3,367 3,356 6,252 Total non-interest income$19,052 $(1,993)$2,751 ________________________________________(1)Not within the scope of ASC 606.A description of the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 is as follows: Service Charges on Deposit AccountsThe Company earns fees from deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed at the point in the time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance.Gains/Losses on Sales of OREOThe Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. Gain/Losses on the sales of OREO falls within the scope of ASC 606, if the Company finances the transaction. Under ASC 606, if the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company is required to assess whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether the collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related (loss) gain on sale if a significant financing component is present. Interchange IncomeThe Company earns interchange fees from debit and credit card holder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided by an outsourced technology solution.F-68Table of ContentsKEARNY FINANCIAL CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 21 – Net Income (Loss) per Common Share (“EPS”)Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding, including both vested and unvested restricted stock awards, adjusted for ESOP shares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options or unvested restricted stock units (“RSU”), were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts or securities exercisable or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. Shares issued and reacquired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding.
