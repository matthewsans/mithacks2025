PART III -- NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Forms
10-Q, 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, N-SAR, or the transition report portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
LSEB CREATIVE CORP. (the “Registrant”)
was unable, without unreasonable effort or expense, to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2025 (the “Annual
Report”) by the June 30, 2025 filing date applicable to smaller reporting companies due to a delay experienced by the Registrant
in completing its financial statements and other disclosures in the Annual Report. As a result, the Registrant is still in the process
of compiling required information to complete the Annual Report and its independent registered public accounting firm requires additional
time to complete its review of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 to be incorporated in the Annual Report. The
Registrant anticipates that it will file the Annual Report no later than the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed filing date.

If answer is no, identify report(s). Yes ☒    No ☐
(3)
Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report or portion thereof? Yes ☐    No ☒
