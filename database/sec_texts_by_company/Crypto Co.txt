EXPLANATORY
NOTE
This
Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A (this “Amendment No. 2”) amends the Annual Report
on Form 10-K of The Crypto Company (the “Company”) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as originally filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 16, 2024 (the “Original Filing”), and supplements the Form
10-K/A filed with the SEC on June 2, 2025 (“Amendment No. 1”). This Amendment No. 2 is being filed solely to revise the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Original Filing, as amended by Amendment No. 1, by amending and restating Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, to include the quarterly impact of each adjustment made to the December 31, 2023 financial statements.
The
Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have also provided new certifications dated as of the date
of this filing in connection with this Amendment No. 2 (Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2).
References throughout this Amendment No. 2 to “we,”
“us,” the “Company” or “our company” are to The Crypto Company, Inc. unless otherwise indicated.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Amendment No.
2 have the meaning given to them in the Original Filing, as amended by Amendment No. 1.
Except
as described above, no other information included in the Original Filing, as amended by Amendment No. 1 is being amended or updated by this Amendment No. 2 and this
Amendment No. 2 does not purport to reflect any information or events subsequent to the Original Filing, as amended by Amendment No. 1. This Amendment No. 2 continues
to describe the conditions as of the date of the Original Filing and, except as expressly contained herein, we have not updated, modified
or supplemented the disclosures contained in the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 2 should be read in conjunction with
the Original Filing, Amendment No. 1 and with our filings with the SEC subsequent to the Original Filing.
PART
I
FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
This
report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You
can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can find many (but not
all) of these statements by looking for words such as “approximates,” “believes,” “hopes,” “expects,”
“anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “would,”
“should,” “could,” “may” or other similar expressions in this report. In particular, forward-looking
statements include statements relating to future actions, prospective products, applications, customers and technologies, and future
performance or future financial results. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:
●
our
ability to execute our business plan and achieve profitability;
●
our
levels of indebtedness;
●
rapidly
advancing technology;
●
the
impact of competitive or alternative services and technologies;
●
the
impact of government regulations on certain uses of blockchain technology, volatility of digital assets in general, and the public
perceptions of blockchain technology and crypto currency;
●
our
exposure to and ability to defend third-party claims and challenges to our intellectual property rights;
●
our
ability to obtain adequate financing in the future, as and when we need it;
●
our
history of losses;
●
our
ability to identify and acquire additional assets or businesses to enhance our revenue sources;
●
our
success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and
●
other
factors discussed in this report.
Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements. The forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions and
are made as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included
in this report to conform such statements to actual results or changes in our expectations. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements.
1
Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements
This
report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future
financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including, “could” “may”,
“will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”,
“estimate”, “predict”, “potential” and the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.
While
these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment
regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions,
projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this Annual Report.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes
contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking
statements based upon current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from
those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, risks generally described in this
report.
We
are engaged in the business of providing consulting services and education for blockchain technology and for the building of technological
infrastructure and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. We currently generate revenues and incur expenses solely through these
consulting and education operations.

the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues relating to consulting services were $197,459 compared to $619,538 for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue is mainly attributable to a decrease in online sales and exiting the Bitcoin mining
business as well as the reclassification of $207,938 initially recorded as revenue in the 2023 period which was reclassified
to other liabilities due to a lack of support for revenue recognition under the guidelines of ASC 606.
Cost
of services for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $313,756 and $369,313, respectively. The decrease is attributable
to the decrease in revenue offset by a slight increase in training revenue. Cost of services of TechCC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is comprised of payroll expense.
General
and administrative expenses and share-based compensation
For
the year ended December 31, 2023, our general and administrative expenses were $1,548,277 a decrease of 17.0% compared to $1,864,543
for the year ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs relating to professional services,
payroll and payroll-related expenses for the Company excluding payroll at TechCC and depreciation and amortization expenses. Professional
services included in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of contracting fees, consulting fees, accounting fees, and
legal costs. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects decreased costs associated with outside consulting, legal, and accounting
costs, and costs incurred to effect the BTA acquisition and other business development efforts.
Share-based
compensation was $1,155,480 for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 45.1% compared to $2,104,126 for the year ended December
31, 2022. Share-based compensation decreased due to warrant issuances in 2022 to various lenders as compared to less issuances in 2023.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
As a result of the less than expected operating performance
at BTA we determined at December 31, 2023, that the intangible assets of $530,837 and goodwill were fully impaired. As a result, we recorded
a loss on impairment of $1,271,306 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to no impairment for the period ended December 31, 2022.
Other
Income
Other
income and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $(2,625) compared to $(56,863) during the same period in 2022. The decrease
in other expenses is primarily attributable to the loss on disposal of business amounting to $(142,728) during the year ended December
31, 2022.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with United States
(“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flows since inception. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of
$72,970. Our loss before provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $7,231,317 for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our working capital was negative $6,126,104 as of December 31, 2023.
During
2023 we funded our operations with various loans as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to continue funding our operations
through debt instruments and, if possible, through equity issuances. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in
obtaining additional funding, and if funding can be obtained on favorable terms.

Operating
Activities
We
have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in the areas of professional fees and contracting services.
Net
cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,642,137 compared to net cash used of $1,930,308 for the
year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non- cash share based compensation, offset by increased operating losses.
Investing
Activities
Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $-0- compared to net cash used of $50,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The difference is primarily attributable to the purchase of equipment in 2022.
Financing
Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,604,500, compared to $2,015,215 for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The decrease of $410,715 was primarily the result of a decrease in proceeds from issuance of notes payable.
Subsequent
to December 31, 2023, we raised approximately $262,000 in cash proceeds from various transactions described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- Note 9 Subsequent Events
The
Company borrowed funds pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “AJB SPA”) entered into with AJB Capital
Investments, LLC (“AJB”), and issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $120,000 (the “AJB Note”) to
AJB in a private transaction for a purchase price of $108,000, each dated as of April 12, 2024 and as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements- Note 9 Subsequent Events. In connection with the sale of the AJB Note, the Company also paid certain
fees and expenses of AJB and of the Company’s Auditor. After payment of the fees and expenses, the net proceeds to the Company
were $45,000, which will be used for working capital, to fund potential acquisitions or other forms of strategic relationships, and other
general corporate purposes.
The
maturity date of the AJB Note is October 12, 2024. The AJB Note bears no interest on the principal except for default interest, if any.
The Company may prepay the AJB Note at any time without penalty. Under the terms of the AJB Note, the Company may not issue additional
debt that is not subordinate to AJB, must comply with the Company’s reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and must maintain the listing of the Company’s common stock on the OTC Market or other exchange, among other restrictions
and requirements. The Company’s failure to make required payments under the AJB Note or to comply with any of these covenants,
among other matters, would constitute an event of default. Upon an event of default under the AJB SPA or AJB Note, the AJB Note will
bear interest at the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum amount permitted under law, AJB may immediately accelerate the AJB Note due
date, AJB may convert the amount outstanding under the AJB Note into shares of Company common stock at a discount to the market price
of the stock, and AJB will be entitled to its costs of collection, among other penalties and remedies.
The
Company provided various representations, warranties, and covenants to AJB in the AJB SPA. The Company’s breach of any representation
or warranty, or failure to comply with the covenants would constitute an event of default.
The
Company also entered into a Security Agreement with AJB pursuant to which the Company granted to AJB a security interest in substantially
all of the Company’s assets to secure the Company’s obligations under the AJB SPA and AJB Note.
The offer and sale
of the AJB Note was made in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), in reliance on exemptions afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation
D promulgated thereunder.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Stock-Based
Compensation
In
accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), the Company measures the compensation costs of
stock-based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value of granted instruments and recognizes the costs in consolidated financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Stock-based
compensation arrangements include stock options.
Equity
instruments (“instruments”) issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required
by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees (“ASC 505”), defines the measurement date and recognition
period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when
the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete and (ii) the instruments are vested. The compensation cost is remeasured
at fair value at each reporting period when the award vests. As a result, stock option-based payments to non-employees can result in
significant volatility in compensation expense.
The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using
this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company’s common stock
price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the period of time over which employees and non-employees are expected to
hold their options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate.
4
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company recognizes and discloses the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable
inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty
involved in determining fair value.
Level
1
Inputs
are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurable date.
Level
2
Inputs,
other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data
at the measurement date.
Level
3
Unobservable
inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date.
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Goodwill
and Indefinite-lived intangible Assets
We
test for the impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating
that a possible impairment has been incurred.
We
perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of our fourth quarter based on the income approach, also known as the discounted
cash flow (“DCF”) method, which utilizes the present value of future cash flows to estimate fair value. We also use the market
approach, which utilizes market price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as that of our company, to
estimate fair value. A reconciliation of the two methods is performed to assess the reasonableness of fair value of each of the reporting
units.
The
future cash flows used under the DCF method are derived from estimates of future revenues, operating income, working capital requirements
and capital expenditures, which in turn reflect specific global, industry and market conditions. The discount rate developed is based
on data and factors relevant to the economies in which the business operates and other risks associated with those cash flows, including
the potential variability in the amount and timing of the cash flows. A terminal growth rate is applied to the final year of the projected
period and reflects our estimate of stable growth to perpetuity. We then calculate the present value of the respective cash flows for
each reporting unit to arrive at the fair value using the income approach and then determine the appropriate weighting between the fair
value estimated using the income approach and the fair value estimated using the market approach. Finally, we compare the estimated fair
value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets to its respective carrying value in order to determine if the goodwill assigned to
each reporting unit is potentially impaired. In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU
2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminated
Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. If the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no
further testing is required. If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount
of goodwill allocated to that asset.
5
Significant
assumptions used include management’s estimates of future growth rates, the amount and timing of future operating cash flows, capital
expenditures, discount rates, as well as market and industry conditions and relevant comparable company multiples for the market approach.
Assumptions utilized are highly judgmental, especially given the role technology plays in driving the demand for consulting services
in the blockchain technology space. Based on the analysis that we performed at December 31, 2023, we determined that there was no impairment
of our goodwill or intangible assets.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes consulting revenue when the service is rendered, the fee for arrangement is fixed or determinable, and collectability
is reasonably assured.
Income
Taxes
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based
on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and
the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be
ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period
during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest
amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing
authorities upon examination.
Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions
We
do not have any off-balance sheet transactions.
Trends,
Events and Uncertainties
The
blockchain technology market is dynamic and unpredictable. Although we undertake compliance efforts, including efforts with commercially
reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that there will not be a new or unforeseen law, regulation or risk factor which will
materially impact our ability to continue our business as currently operated or raise additional capital to foster our continued growth.
We
cannot assure you that our consulting business will develop as planned, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations,
or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required
to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.
Other
than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that
are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.

9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
On May 3, 2024, the SEC entered an order barring BF Borgers, the Company’s
then independent registered public accounting firm, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant and therefore BF Borgers
could no longer act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Effective May 8, 2024, the Company dismissed
Borgers as its independent registered public accounting firm. Subsequently, the Company engaged Bush and Associates CPA as the Company’s
new independent registered public accounting firm.

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Conclusions
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2023 As a result of adjustments discovered during the re-audit of the Company’s
December 31, 2023 financial statements, management has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of December 31, 2023.
Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that:
●
Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company;
●
Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
●
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO 2013).
Based
on its assessment, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting were not effective.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
were changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that has materially
affected
our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the re-audit of the December 31, 2023 financial statements we determined that we had a material weakness
in both disclosure controls and control over financial reporting.
Inherent
Limitations of Controls
Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

The
Crypto Company

Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of The Crypto Company (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and the related
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the
related notes to the financial statements (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Crypto Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
The
financial statements of The Crypto Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, before adjustments described in Note 3, were audited by
other auditors whose report dated April 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements, including an explanatory paragraph
concerning going concern. We also audited the adjustments described in Note 3 that were applied to restate the 2023 financial statements.
In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations and has
a significant accumulated deficit, that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

THE
CRYPTO COMPANY
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
1 – THE COMPANY
The
Crypto Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 9, 2017. The Company is engaged in the business of providing consulting
services and education for distributed ledger technologies (“blockchain”), for the building of technological infrastructure
and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. The Company currently generates revenues and incurs expenses solely through these consulting
operations.
Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Crypto,” the “Company,” “we,”
“us,” and “our” in these consolidated financial statements refer to The Crypto Company and, where
appropriate, its wholly-owned subsidiary Technology Convergence Company (“TechCC”) formerly Blockchain Training
Alliance, Inc. (“BTA”) and an inactive subsidiary Coin Tracking, LLC (“CoinTracking”).
The
Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) effective as of March 24, 2021 with BTA and its stockholders. On April 8, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
stock of BTA and BTA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of this acquisition, the operations of BTA became consolidated
with Company operations on April 8, 2021.
TechCC
is a blockchain training company and service provider that provides training and educational courses focused on blockchain technology
and education as to the general understanding of blockchain to corporate and individual clients.
During
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated revenues and incurred expenses primarily through the business of providing
consulting services and education for distributed ledger technologies, for the building of technological infrastructure
and enterprise blockchain technology solutions, both of which have ceased operations as of the date of this Annual Report.
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Going
Concern
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with
United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flows since inception. As of December 31, 2023, the Company
had cash of $72,970. In addition, the Company’s net loss was $7,231,317 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the
Company’s had a working capital deficit of $6,126,104. As of December 31, 2023 the accumulated deficit amounted to
$46,762,752. As a result of the Company’s history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management is evaluating different strategies to obtain financing to fund the Company’s expenses and achieve a level of
revenue adequate to support the Company’s current cost structure. Financing strategies may include, but are not limited to,
private placements of capital stock, debt borrowings, partnerships and/or collaborations. There can be no assurance that any of
these future-funding efforts will be successful. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
of presentation – The company prepares its consolidated financial statements based upon the accrual method of
accounting, recognizing income when earned and expenses when incurred.
Consolidation –
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blockchain
Training Alliance and CoinTracking LLC which is inactive. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.
F-7
Use
of estimates – The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company’s
significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets,
allocation of revenue on software subscriptions, valuation of goodwill from business acquisitions, valuation and recoverability of
investments, valuation allowances of deferred taxes, and share- based compensation expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. In addition, any change in these estimates or their related assumptions could have an adverse effect on the
Company’s operating results.
Cash
and cash equivalents – The Company defines its cash and cash equivalents to include only cash on hand and certain highly liquid
investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions,
the balances of which may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the risk of loss due to the concentration
is minimal.
Investments
in cryptocurrency – Investments are comprised of several cryptocurrencies the Company owns, of which a majority is Bitcoin,
that are actively traded on exchanges. The Company records its investments as indefinite-lived intangible assets at cost less impairment
and are reported as long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized
but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely
than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for
impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that
an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test
is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment
loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.
Realized
gains and losses on sales of investments in cryptocurrency, and impairment losses, are included in other income/(expense) in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
As
of
December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were $-0- in investments in cryptocurrency on the Company’s Balance Sheet. However, during
the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company received tokens from cryptocurrency investments that were previously written down to -0-
value. These tokens were immediately liquidated, and the total proceeds received from them was $67,600 and classified as “Other
Income from the Recovery of Tokens” in the Company’s Statement of Operations.
Equipment
– Equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life ranging from
three to five years. Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially adapt, improve, or alter the
nature of the underlying assets are capitalized. When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income.
Business
combination – The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill.
The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the dates of acquisition.
Goodwill
and intangible assets – The Company records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired as goodwill. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of
purchased customer relationships, trade names, and developed technologies. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over
the period of estimated economic benefit of five years. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC
350”), goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested annually, on December 31, or more
frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. Indefinite lived intangible assets also include investments in cryptocurrency
(see Investments in Cryptocurrency).
F-8
The
Company assesses whether goodwill impairment and indefinite lived intangible assets exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments.
The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company
determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects
not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at
the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2023 the Company determined that no impairment had occurred.
Income
taxes – Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future consequences of events that have been
included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of
deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents
the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be
ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period
during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest
amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.
The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing
authorities upon examination.
As
of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $10,613,000 portions
of which will begin to expire in 2037. Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject
to annual limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state
provisions. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
Fair
value measurements – The Company recognizes and discloses the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based
upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). Each level of input has different
levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value.
Level
1
Inputs
are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurable date.
Level
2
Inputs,
other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data
at the measurement date.
Level
3
Unobservable
inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date.
F-9
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Revenue
recognition – The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
●
Step
1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation
In
order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in
the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of
a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can
benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e.,
the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is
separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the
context of the contract).
If
a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services
is identified that is distinct.
The
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods
or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.
When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:
Variable
consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of
cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price
allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time
as appropriate.
The
Company adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method for contracts as of the date of initial
application.
Share-based
compensation
In
accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), the Company measures the compensation
costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value of granted instruments and recognizes the costs in
the consolidated financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based
compensation arrangements include stock options.
Equity
instruments (“instruments”) issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required
by ASC 718. ASC No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees (“ASC 505”), defines the measurement date and recognition
period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) when
the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete and (ii) the instruments are vested. The compensation cost is remeasured
at fair value at each reporting period when the award vests. As a result, stock option-based payments to non-employees can result in
significant volatility in compensation expense.
The
Company accounts for its share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Using
this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to the (i) expected volatility of the Company’s common stock
price, (ii) expected life of the award, which for options is the period of time over which employees and non-employees are expected to
hold their options prior to exercise, and (iii) risk-free interest rate.
Net
loss per common share – The Company reports earnings per share (“EPS”) with a dual presentation of basic EPS and
diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed as net income divided by the weighted average of common shares for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issued through stock options, or warrants. For the year ended December 31,
2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. Therefore, the basic EPS
and the diluted EPS are the same.
Marketing
expense – Marketing expenses are charged to operations, under general and administrative expenses. The Company incurred $26,869
of marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $31,777 for year ended December 31, 2022.
Reclassifications
– Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
or cashflows.

NOTE
4 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated
financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a
material impact on its financial position or results of operations except as noted below:
On
November 15, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which (1) provides a framework to stagger effective dates for future major accounting
standards and (2) amends the effective dates for certain major new accounting standards to give implementation relief to certain types
of entities. Specifically, ASU 2019-10 amends the effective date for ASU 2017-04 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and
interim periods therein.
Early
adoption continues to be permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements for both annual and interim reporting periods.
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income
tax accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business
combination, ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective
for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
In
February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments
to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for
smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for us for interim and annual periods in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40), (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and
contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU2020-06 amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
NOTE
5 – ACQUISITION
On April 8, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of BTA and BTA
became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the closing the Company delivered to the sellers a total of $600,000 in cash, promissory
notes in the total principal amount of $150,000 bearing 1% interest per annum, and an aggregate of 201,439 shares of Company common stock
valued at $604,317 in accordance with the terms of the SPA. Additionally, the Company acquired $4,860 in cash at BTA.
As

The
Company recognized $-0- and $-0- of compensation expense related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
As of December 31, 2023 these options had no intrinsic value since they were all out of the money as of December 31, 2023.
The
determination of the fair value of share-based compensation awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company’s
stock price and a number of complex and subjective assumptions, including stock price, volatility, expected life of the equity award,
forfeitures rates if any, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. Volatility is based on the historical volatility of comparable
companies measured over the most recent period, generally commensurate with the expected life of the Company’s stock options, adjusted
for future expectations given the Company’s limited historical share price data.
The
risk-free rate is based on implied yields in effect at the time of the grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with remaining terms
equal to the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend
pay-outs. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur.
The
range of assumptions used for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:

at approximately $0.01 per share based on the Company’s stock trading price on the OTC market on the date of issuance.

date. The conversion of the Fourth Diagonal Note is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% of the number of shares of
common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. Failure of the Company to convert the Note and deliver the
common stock when due will result in the Company paying Diagonal a monetary penalty for each day beyond such deadline.

of Default”, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 22%, and the Company may be obligated to pay to the Diagonal an
amount equal to 150% of all amounts due and owing under the Note.
