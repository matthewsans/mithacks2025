These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “could,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “predict,” “potential” or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to:●our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, satisfy our existing debt service obligations and negotiate maturity date extensions or other modifications to the terms of our existing financing arrangements to the extent necessary;●our ability to continue after July 2027, the maturity date of the largest credit facility on the portfolio;  ●the imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year or forego an opportunity to ensure REIT status;  ●uncertainties related to the national economy, the real estate industry in general and in our specific markets;●economic risks due to the uncertainty regarding tariffs that raise costs for businesses can deter new tenants from leasing space in commercial office buildings;  ●legislative or regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing REITS;  ●construction costs that may exceed estimates or construction delays;  ●further increases in interest rates;  ●availability of credit or significant disruption in the credit markets;  ●litigation risks;●inflation increase in the United States not captured in expense recoveries by the several tenants paying gross instead of triple net leases;   ●risks inherent to the real estate business, including tenant defaults, potential liability related to environmental matters and the lack of liquidity of real estate investments;  ●inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases at our properties;  ●inability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax or other applicable laws;  ●the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flow;●our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to pay distributions to our stockholders;●our ability to retain key personnel of our advisor and other affiliates of our advisor.1Any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included herein could be inaccurate, and undue reliance should not be placed upon any forward-looking statements included herein. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Annual Report, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from the expectations expressed herein will increase with the passage of time. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report, including, without limitation, the risks described under “Risk Factors,” the inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans set forth in this Annual Report will be achieved.  RISK FACTOR SUMMARYWe are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in our forward-looking statements, including those summarized below. The following list of risks and uncertainties is only a summary of some of the most important factors and is not intended to be exhaustive. This risk factor summary should be read together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.General Investment Risks•Shares of our common stock are illiquid. No public market currently exists for our shares, and our share redemption program is indefinitely suspended. It will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares, and they will likely sell them at a substantial discount if sold.•In order to combat the impact of rising interest costs, inflation, recession uncertainty on free cash flow, on November 28, 2022, the board of directors (the "Board") of Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. (the “Company”) approved the suspension of the Company's share redemption program, effective immediately.•If we make distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, then we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties, our stockholders’ overall return may be reduced and the value of a share of our common stock may be diluted. Distributions have been suspended since December 16, 2022.•We have disclosed estimated net asset values (NAVs) per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2022. The NAV per share we disclose in the future may vary significantly from the value as of December 31, 2022 and may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our assets and liabilities. •We pay substantial fees and expenses to our advisor and its affiliates. These fees were not negotiated at arm’s length, may be higher than fees payable to unaffiliated third parties, and may reduce cash available for investment. •Our inability to obtain funding for future capital needs could adversely impact our ability to make cash distributions to
stockholders and the value of our investments.Risks Related to Conflict of Interest•Our executive officers face conflicts of interest related to their positions with our advisor and its affiliates. Hartman Advisors II, LLC is the advisor to two small non-registered alternative investments. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure•Maryland law and our organizational documents limit your right to bring claims against our officers and directors.•Our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise benefit our stockholders.•Our stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks faced by our stockholders.2•Although we have opted out of certain anti-takeover provisions of Maryland law, our board of directors could opt into these protections in the future, which could make it more difficult for us to be acquired, could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a business combination, and could make it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors.Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate•A decrease in demand for office, retail or industrial space may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our
assets are class B office assets in suburban submarkets of Houston and San Antonio, Texas. While the post pandemic work from home trend has continued to affect occupancy in commercial office buildings, suburban buildings have been safeguarded against this risk due to employee's demand to have a shortened commute. •Market trends and other conditions outside of our control could decrease the value of our investments and weaken our operating results.•The loss or downsizing of a significant tenant in a property could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, ability to borrow funds and cash flows.•We face significant competition, which could decrease the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. •Properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your investment.•We are currently involved in legal proceedings, and we may from time to time in the future be involved in legal proceedings the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. •Because we rely on our advisor and its wholly-owned property management company to manage the day-to-day affairs of any properties we may acquire, our operating results with respect to a particular property could be hindered and our net income could be reduced if the staff of a particular property perform poorly.•We may be required to make rent or other concessions and significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Risks Associated with Debt Financing•Our use of debt will reduce cash available for distributions and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.•High mortgage interest rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could adversely impact our net income and the amount of cash distributions we can make. Furthermore, office is seen as an unfavorable asset class in the debt markets, and identifying lenders that will lend on the product type is challenging. Federal Income Tax Risks•Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.•Compliance with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities, which may hinder or delay our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.•Our charter will not permit any person or group to own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding capital stock of all classes or series, and attempts to acquire our common stock or our capital stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 9.8% limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors.•You may have current tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our common stock.•If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we would cease to qualify as a REIT.3•Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.•Stockholders could incur a tax liability in the event that we sell a property and realize a gain but do not make a related distribution to stockholders because the proceeds are needed internally. Retirement Plan Risks•An investment in our stock by plan or account subject to ERISA could subject the fiduciary of that plan or account to certain standards the breach of which could result in criminal and/or civil penalties.4PART IItem 1.    Business We were formed as a Maryland corporation on September 3, 2015 to acquire, develop and operate a diverse portfolio of value-oriented commercial properties, including office, retail, industrial and warehouse properties, located primarily in Texas. We intend to acquire properties in which there is a significant potential for growth in income and value from re-tenanting, repositioning, redevelopment, and operational enhancements. We believe that real estate, and in particular commercial real estate, provides an excellent investment for those investors looking for diversification, income and wealth preservation and growth in their portfolio. We believe that we have significant experience in acquiring and managing these types of properties, largely through our relationships with REIT Property Management, LLC, which is our Sponsor, and other affiliates.Our charter authorizes the Company to issue 950,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 270,000,000 are classified as Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A Shares”), 280,000,000 are classified as shares of Class I common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class I Shares”), 280,000,000 are classified as shares of Class S common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class S Shares"), 70,000,000 are classified as shares of Class T common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class T Shares”), and 50,000,000 are classified as shares of preferred stock without par value.
On June 24, 2016, we commenced our initial public offering in which we offered up to $269,000,000 in shares of our common stock, which at the time was unclassified. On January 9, 2017, we amended our charter to (1) create the Class A Shares and the Class T Shares and (2) convert each share of our common stock outstanding as of that date into one Class A Share.
On February 6, 2017, we revised our initial public offering to allow the offer and sale of up to $269,000,000 in Class A Shares and Class T Shares.
In a follow-on offering that commenced on January 14, 2020, we began offering up to $180,000,000 in any combination of Class A Shares and Class T Shares to the public and up to $5,000,000 in Class Shares and Class T Shares to stockholders pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. On May 12, 2020, the Company's board of directors created the Class I Shares and the Class S Shares, and our follow-on offering was revised on July 27, 2020 to allow us to offer shares of those classes.
Our follow-on offering ended on January 14, 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, we had accepted subscriptions for and issued under all public offerings 8,706,919, net of redemptions, Class A Shares, including 840,901 shares, net of redemptions, pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, 38,198 Class I Shares, 19,708 Class S Shares, and 503,255 Class T Shares, net of redemptions, including 40,380 shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $91,699,487.
We have used, and intend to continue to use, the net proceeds to acquire commercial real estate properties located primarily in Texas.
For additional information, see “Investment Strategy” below.Effective April 17, 2023, the Company terminated the advisory agreement with Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC, which served as our advisor, and the property management agreement with Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., which served as our property manager.
Also effective April 17, 2023, the Company executed an advisory agreement with Hartman Advisors II, LLC, which now serves as our advisor, and a property management agreement with REIT Property Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors II, LLC, which now serves as the property manager of our real estate investments.
Allen R. Hartman is the sole member of Hartman Advisors II, LLC. Hartman Advisors II, LLC manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Our advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.
Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor is responsible for managing the Company’s affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and investments on behalf of the Company.5Substantially all of our business is conducted through Hartman vREIT XXI Operating Partnership, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and Hartman vREIT XXI Holdings LLC, and Hartman vREIT XXI SLP, LLC, are the initial limited partners of our operating partnership. As we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock, we will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to our operating partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that our operating partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our operating partnership will not be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our operating partnership being taxed as a corporation rather than as a partnership. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our operating partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our operating partnership. We will experience a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets.We elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year after the taxable year in which we initially elect to be taxed as a REIT, then we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied.
Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of 100% ownership of ten commercial properties, an 83% tenant in common interest in an office property, and investments in two unconsolidated affiliate entities. For additional information, see “Investment Portfolio” below.Our principal executive offices are located at 11211 Katy Freeway, Suite 309, Houston, Texas 77079, and our main telephone number is 713-400-1000.Investment Objectives       Our primary investment objectives are to:•realize growth in the value of our investments;•preserve, protect and return stockholders’ capital contributions; and•grow net cash from operations and pay regular cash distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will achieve these objectives due to the current economic slowdown, high interest rate environment and increased inflation. Effective December 16, 2022, we suspended the payment of distributions to preserve capital and secure our financial health on an ongoing basis. Investment StrategyThe cornerstone of our investment strategy is our advisor’s discipline in acquiring a portfolio of real estate properties that offer a blend of current and potential income based on in-place occupancy plus significant potential for growth in income and value from re-tenanting, repositioning, redevelopment, and operational enhancements. We refer to this strategy as “value-oriented” or the “Hartman Advantage.” We rely upon the value-oriented or Hartman Advantage strategy to evaluate numerous potential commercial real estate acquisition and investment opportunities per each completed acquisition or investment.We intend to continue to acquire, develop and operate a diverse portfolio of value-oriented commercial properties, including office, retail, industrial and warehouse properties located primarily in Texas. The commercial properties we acquire may be existing income-producing properties, properties developed by an affiliate of our advisor, newly constructed properties or properties under development or construction. We target properties that are located in high traffic areas, have adequate parking, have good curb appeal, have occupancy rates of at least 50%, and have a diversified tenant mix of creditworthy tenants.6We may also invest a portion of the offering proceeds available for investment in unimproved land upon which improvements are to be constructed or completed. However, we may not invest more than 10% of the aggregate cost of the real property assets within our portfolio in unimproved land or real properties which are not expected to produce income within two years of their acquisition. Development of real properties is subject to risks relating to a builder’s ability to control construction costs or to build in conformity with plans, specifications and timetables.Investment Portfolio
As of December 31, 2022, our investments in real estate assets consisted of (1) 10 wholly-owned properties, (2) an 83% (approximate) tenant in common interest in an office property, (3) a 2.47% ownership interest in a special purpose entity that owned as of December 31, 2022, 39 office, retail and light industrial properties in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, Texas, which we refer to as Hartman SPE LLC, and (4) an equity investment in an affiliated REIT.The following table sets forth information regarding our property portfolio as of December 31, 2022.Property NameSpace TypeLocationGross Leasable Area SFIn-Place OccupancyAnnualized Base Rental Revenue (in thousands)Average Base Rental Revenue per Occupied SFAverage Net Effective Annual Base Rent per Occupied SFVillage PointeRetailSan Antonio54,246 94 %$745 $14.53 $14.61 Richardson Tech CenterFlex/R&DDallas96,660 99 %667 6.946.89Spectrum BuildingOfficeSan Antonio175,390 62 %2,530 23.3923.3111211 Katy FreewayOfficeHouston77,851 97 %913 12.0812.061400 BroadfieldOfficeHouston102,893 90 %1,733 18.7318.7616420 Park Ten PlaceOfficeHouston83,760 80 %916 13.7513.59Willowbrook BuildingOfficeHouston67,581 93 %526 8.348.03Timberway IIOfficeHouston130,828 77 %1,722 17.2017.25One Park TenOfficeHouston34,089 100 %399 11.6911.61Two Park TenOfficeHouston56,443 99 %963 17.1717.173100 Weslayan (1) OfficeHouston78,289 70 %1,092 20.0420.05Grand Total958,030 83 %$12,206 $15.29 $15.25 (1) We own an approximately 83% tenant in common interest in this office property.On August 23, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Richardson Tech Center for $10,261,000.
The property was acquired in March 2018 for $5,040,000. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the line of credit that the Company has with East West Bank by $9,337,000 and funded a Capital Reserve account with East West Bank for $500,000. Other closing costs were covered with the remainder of the funds.
7CompetitionThe United States commercial real estate market is highly competitive. All of our properties will be located in areas that include competing properties. We face competition from various entities for investment opportunities in our targeted assets, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds, real estate companies and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the geographic location of investments or the creditworthiness of tenants. Competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell real estate assets. The majority of our
assets are class B office assets in suburban submarkets of Houston and San Antonio. While the post pandemic work from home trend has continued to affect occupancy in commercial office buildings, suburban buildings have been somewhat safeguarded against this risk due to employee's demand to have a shortened commute. The amount of competition in a particular market could also impact our ability to lease space and impact the amount of rent we are able to charge. Disruptions in the credit markets may materially impact the cost and availability of debt to finance real estate acquisitions, which is a key component of our acquisition strategy. A limited availability of financing in the future could reduce suitable investment opportunities and create a competitive advantage for other entities that have greater financial resources than we do. All of the above factors could result in delays in the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering.EmployeesAlthough we have executive officers who manage our operations, we do not have any paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, acquisition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.RegulationsAll real property investments and the operations conducted in connection with such investments are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liabilities on customers, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on a real property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such real property as collateral for future borrowings. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which real property may be used or businesses may be operated. Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures or may impose material environmental liability. Additionally, tenants’ operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our real properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our real properties. There are also various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply and which may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance. In connection with the acquisition and ownership of real properties, we may be exposed to such costs in connection with such regulations. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of any damages or fines we must pay, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated real property could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or lower the value of our assets and, consequently, lower the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.We do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.8Tax StatusWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) to our stockholders.  As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. We believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.Financial Information About Industry SegmentsOur current business consists of acquiring, developing, owning, managing, leasing, operating, and disposing of real estate assets. We internally evaluate all of our real estate assets as one industry segment and, accordingly, do not report segment information.Economic Dependency We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, purchase and disposition of properties and other investments, management of the daily operations of our real estate portfolio, and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide these services to us, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources, and our failure to identify such other sources could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also depend upon the dealer manager for the sale of our shares of common stock in our initial public offering.Available InformationWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and, accordingly, we file annual reports, quarterly reports and other information with the SEC. Access to copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC, including amendments to such filings, may be obtained free of charge from our website, http://www.hartmanreits.com/hartman-vreit-xxi/sec-filings-2/. These filings are available promptly after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. We are not incorporating our website or any information from the website into this Annual Report. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov, were our filings with the SEC are available free of charge. We will provide without charge a copy of this Annual Report, including financial statements and schedules, upon written request delivered to our principal executive office at the address listed on the cover page of this Annual Report.Item 1A.    Risk FactorsThe following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. References to “shares” and “our common stock” in this Item 1A refer to all share classes of our common stock.9Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsShares of our common stock are illiquid. No public market currently exists for our shares, and our charter does not require us to liquidate our assets or list our shares on an exchange by any specified date. As a result, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares, and if they are able to sell their shares, they will likely sell them at a substantial discount.There is no current public market for our shares. We presently intend, but are not required, to evaluate a transaction providing liquidity for our stockholders within three to seven years from the termination of our initial public offering. Our charter does not require our board of directors to pursue any particular liquidity event at any particular time or at all. However, if we have not begun the process of liquidating our assets or listing our shares within seven years of the termination of our initial public offering and our board and a majority of our independent directors have not approved otherwise and set a future date for such a liquidation or listing, then, upon the request of stockholders holding 10% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, our charter requires that we solicit proxies from stockholders to determine whether we should be liquidated and dissolved. Accordingly, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at the times and/or the prices that they desire or at all. Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of our outstanding capital stock or 9.8% in number of shares of our outstanding common stock unless exempted prospectively or retroactively by our board of directors. Even if our stockholders are able to sell shares of our common stock, the absence of a public market may cause the price received for any shares of our common stock sold to be less than what our stockholders paid or less than their proportionate value of the assets we own. Moreover, our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that limit our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares to us, and our board of directors may amend, or suspend our share redemption program without stockholder approval upon 30 days’ written prior notice. Investors should purchase our shares only as a long-term investment because of their illiquid nature.We have limited operating history which makes our future performance difficult to predict.We commenced operations on November 14, 2016 and have a limited operating history. You should not assume that our performance will be similar to the past performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by our Sponsor or the parent of our Sponsor. Our limited operating history increases the risk and uncertainty that you face in making an investment in our shares relative to an investment in the shares of common stock of a real estate investment trust with a substantial operating history.Our cash distributions have been indefinitely suspended. To the extent paid in the future, our distributions will not be guaranteed, may fluctuate and may constitute a return of capital or taxable gain from the sale or exchange of property.
Effective December 16, 2022, our board of directors approved the suspension of the payment of distributions to our stock holders. There can be no assurance that our board of directors will recommence distributions.
To the extent that the payment of distributions is resumed, the actual amount and timing of distributions will be determined by our board of directors and typically will depend upon the amount of funds available for distribution, which will depend on items such as current and projected cash requirements and tax considerations. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. Our long-term strategy is to fund the payment of monthly distributions to our stockholders entirely from our funds from operations. However, we may need to borrow funds, request that our advisor in its discretion, defer its receipt of fees and reimbursements of expenses or, to the extent necessary, utilize offering proceeds in order to make cash distributions. Accordingly, the amount of distributions paid at any given time may not reflect current cash flow from operations.If we make distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, then we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties, our stockholders’ overall return may be reduced and the value of a share of our common stock may be diluted.Our organizational documents permit us to make distributions from any source. If we do resume distributions and our cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover our distributions, then we expect to use the proceeds from our public stock offerings, the proceeds from borrowings, and/or the waiver or deferral of fees otherwise owed to our advisor to make distributions. If we fund distributions from borrowings, sales of properties, or the net proceeds from our stock offerings, then we will have less funds available for the acquisition of assets resulting in potentially fewer investments, less diversification of our portfolio and a reduced overall return to you. In addition, the value of your investment in shares of our common stock may be diluted because funds that would otherwise be available to make investments would be diverted to fund distributions. Further, to the extent distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, a stockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain. There is no limit on the amount we can fund distributions from sources other than from our current and accumulated earnings and profits.10Because we are dependent upon our advisor and its affiliates to conduct our operations, any adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor or its affiliates or our relationship with them could hinder our operating performance and the return on our stockholders’ investment.We are dependent on our advisor to manage our operations and our portfolio of real estate assets and our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to conduct our operations is dependent upon the performance of our advisor. Our advisor will depend largely upon the fees that it will receive from us in connection with the purchase, management and sale of assets, as well as fees it collects from other affiliates, to conduct its operations. Any adverse changes in the financial condition of our advisor or our relationship with our advisor could hinder its ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments.Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to conduct our operations is dependent upon the performance of our advisor. Our advisor’s business is sensitive to trends in the general economy, as well as the commercial real estate and credit markets. To the extent that any decline in our advisor’s revenues and operating results impacts the financial condition and performance of our advisor, our results of operations and financial condition could also suffer.If we are unable to find suitable investments or we experience delays in doing so, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions.Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions depends upon the performance of our advisor in the acquisition of our investments, including the determination of any financing arrangements. Competition from other entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of sellers of the types of properties we seek to purchase. Additionally, disruptions and dislocations in the credit markets may materially impact the cost and availability of debt to finance real estate acquisitions, which is a key component of our acquisition strategy. A lack of available debt could result in a further reduction of suitable investment opportunities and create a competitive advantage to other entities that have greater financial resources than we do. We can give no assurance that our advisor will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that, if our advisor makes investments on our behalf, our objectives will be achieved. If we, through our advisor, are unable to find suitable investments promptly upon receipt of offering proceeds, then we will hold the proceeds from our public offering in an interest-bearing account or invest the proceeds in short-term assets. If we would continue to be unsuccessful in locating suitable investments, then we may ultimately decide to liquidate. In the event we are unable to timely locate suitable investments, we may be unable or limited in our ability to pay distributions and we may not be able to meet our investment objectives.We have determined estimated net asset values (NAVs) per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2022, The NAV per share we disclose in the future may vary significantly from the value as of December 31, 2022 as we purchase additional assets and raise additional capital from the sale of our shares. The estimated NAV per share values that we disclose may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our assets and liabilities and likely will not represent the amount of net proceeds that would result if we were liquidated.To assist members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, and their associated persons that participated in our stock offerings, pursuant to applicable FINRA rules, we will, not less frequently than annually, disclose an estimated NAVs per share of each class of our common stock, an explanation of the method by which the estimated NAVs per share were determined, and the date of the data used to develop the estimated NAVs per share. Our board of directors has established an estimated NAV per share of our common stock of $9.83 per share as of December 31, 2024 (NAV per share as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $9.78 and $7.97 per share respectively). The market for commercial real estate can fluctuate quickly and substantially and values of our assets and liabilities are expected to change in the future as we continue to raise capital and invest in other properties. Future determinations of our estimated NAV per share are likely to vary significantly from the value established as of December 31, 2024. This approach to establishing an estimated NAV per share may bear little relationship to, and will likely exceed, what a stockholder might receive for its shares if the stockholder tried to sell them or if we liquidated our portfolio.11Subsequent estimated NAVs per share are likely to differ from the price at which a stockholder could resell shares of our common stock because: (1) there is no public trading market for our shares at this time; (2) the price does not reflect, and likely will not reflect, the fair value of our assets as we acquire them, nor will it represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate liquidation of those assets, because the amount of proceeds available for investment from our stock offerings is net of selling commissions, dealer manager fees, other organization and offering costs and acquisition fees and costs and distribution and stockholder servicing fees; (3) the estimated per share value does not take into account how market fluctuations affect the value of our investments, including how the current conditions in the financial and real estate markets may affect the values of our investments; and (4) the estimated per share value does not take into account how developments related to individual assets may increase or decrease the value of our portfolio.Currently there are no SEC, federal or state rules that establish requirements concerning the methodology to employ in determining an estimated per share value. Our board of directors is responsible for determining our estimated NAVs per share no less frequently than annually. To assist our board of directors in determining our estimated NAVs per share, we will obtain independent third-party appraisals or valuation reports for our properties and will value our other assets in a manner we deem most suitable under the circumstances, which may include an independent appraisal or valuation. We anticipate that any property appraiser or valuation expert
we engage will be a member of the Appraisal Institute with the MAI designation or such other professional valuation designation appropriate for the type and geographic locations of the assets being valued and will provide a written opinion, which will include a description of the reviews undertaken and the basis for such opinion. Any such appraisal will be provided to a participating dealer upon request. The valuations will be estimates and consequently should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.  For additional information on the calculation of our estimated net asset value per share as of December 31, 2022 ($7.97 per share), see Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Purchases of Equity Securities—Estimated Net Asset Value Per Share.”The value of a share of our common stock may be diluted if we pay a stock dividend.Our board of directors has previously authorized and declared stock dividends. Investors who purchased shares early in both our initial public offering and our follow-on offering received more shares for the same cash investment than investors who purchase later in the offering as a result of the stock dividend. Because they own more shares, upon a sale or liquidation of the Company, these early investors will receive more sales proceeds or liquidating distributions relative to their invested capital compared to later investors. Unless our assets appreciate in an amount sufficient to offset the dilutive effect of the prior stock dividends, the value per share for later investors purchasing our stock will be below the value per share of earlier investors. Stock dividends were discontinued after September 1, 2019.We may change our targeted investments, our policies and our operations without stockholder consent.Although we have, and continue to expect to invest in office, retail, industrial, and warehouse properties located primarily in Texas, we may also invest in other real estate asset classes located throughout the United States. Except as described in our prospectus, we are not restricted as to the percentage of our offering proceeds that may be invested in properties as compared with the percentage of our proceeds that we may invest in other investments, each of which may be leveraged and will have differing risks and profit potential. Further, we are not limited with respect to the percentage of our offering proceeds that may be invested in any one investment. The greater the percentage of our offering proceeds invested in one asset, the greater the potential adverse effect on us if that asset is unprofitable.We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities, and we may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments described in our prospectus. A change in our targeted investments or investment guidelines could adversely affect the value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.We pay substantial fees and expenses to our advisor and its affiliates. These fees were not negotiated at arm’s length, may be higher than fees payable to unaffiliated third parties, and may reduce cash available for investment.A portion of the offering price from the sale of our shares in our public offerings were and will be used to pay fees and expenses to our advisor and its affiliates. These fees were not negotiated at arm’s length and may be higher than fees payable to unaffiliated third parties. In addition, because the full offering price paid by stockholders will not be invested in assets, stockholders will only receive a full return of their invested capital if either (1) we sell our assets or our company for a sufficient amount in excess of the original purchase price of our assets or (2) the market value of our company after we list our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange is substantially in excess of the original purchase price of our assets.12We reimburse our advisor for amounts it pays in connection with the acquisition or development of a property whether or not we ultimately acquire the asset.We rely on our advisor to locate and acquire properties on our behalf. To the extent that we reimburse our advisor for expenses incurred and a property is not acquired, there will be less funds available for investment in other properties. The failure to close on an acquisition of a property will mean that expenses have been incurred without the ability to recoup those expenses from the operation of the property and could reduce the distributions our stockholders may receive.Our stockholders are limited in their ability to sell shares of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. Stockholders may not be able to sell any shares of our common stock back to us, and if they do sell their shares, they may not receive the price they paid.Our share redemption program has been suspended indefinitely. If our share redemption program were to be reinstated, then it could provide our stockholders with a limited opportunity to have their shares of our common stock redeemed by us at a price equal to or at a discount from the purchase price of the shares of our common stock being redeemed, or at the NAV per share price at the time of redemption, subject to the Board of Directors' discretion. In such event, we anticipate that shares of our common stock would be redeemed on a quarterly basis. However, our share redemption program contains certain restrictions and limitations, including those relating to the number of shares of our common stock that we can redeem at any given time and limiting the redemption price. Specifically, at the time of its suspension, we limited the number of shares to be redeemed to no more than (1) 5.0% of the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year and (2) those that could be funded from the net proceeds from the sale of shares under our distribution reinvestment program in the prior calendar year plus 1.0% of the operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year (to the extent positive) and such additional funds as may be reserved for that purpose by our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors reserves the right to amend, or suspend the share redemption program at any time upon 30 days’ notice. Therefore, our stockholders may not have the opportunity to make a redemption request prior to a potential termination or suspension of the share redemption program and our stockholders may not be able to sell any of their shares of our common stock back to us pursuant to our share redemption program. Moreover, if our stockholders do sell their shares of common stock back to us pursuant to the share redemption program, the price at which the stock will be redeemed may not be the same price they paid for any shares of our common stock being redeemed.If we internalize our management functions, then our stockholders’ interest in us could be diluted and we could incur other significant costs associated with being self-managed.Our board of directors may decide in the future to internalize our management functions. If we do so, then we may elect to negotiate to acquire our advisor’s assets and personnel. At this time, we cannot anticipate the form or amount of consideration or other terms relating to any such acquisition. Such consideration could take many forms, including cash payments, promissory notes and shares of our common stock. The payment of such consideration could result in dilution of our stockholders’ interests in our Company and could reduce the earnings per share and funds from operations per share attributable to our stockholders’ investment in our Company.Additionally, while following such an internalization we would no longer bear the costs of the various fees and expenses we currently pay to our advisor under the advisory agreement with our advisor, our direct expenses would include general and administrative costs, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, SEC reporting and compliance. We would also be required to employ personnel and would be subject to potential liabilities commonly faced by employers, such as workers disability and compensation claims, potential labor disputes and other employee-related liabilities and grievances as well as incur the compensation and benefits costs of our officers and other employees and consultants that we now expect will be paid by our advisor or its affiliates. We may issue equity awards to officers, employees and consultants, which awards would decrease net income and funds from operations and may further dilute our stockholders’ investment. We cannot reasonably estimate the amount of fees to our advisor we would save or the costs we would incur if we became self-managed. If the expenses we assume as a result of an internalization are higher than the expenses we avoid paying to our advisor, then our earnings per share and funds from operations per share would be lower as a result of the internalization than it otherwise would have been, potentially decreasing the amount of funds available to distribute to our stockholders and the value of our shares.13If we internalize our management functions, then we could have difficulty integrating these functions as a stand-alone entity. Currently, our advisor and its affiliates perform asset management and general and administrative functions, including accounting and financial reporting, for multiple entities. These personnel have a great deal of knowledge and experience which provides us with economies of scale. We may fail to properly identify the appropriate mix of personnel and capital needs to operate as a stand-alone entity. An inability to effectively manage an internalization transaction could cause us to incur excess costs and suffer deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting. Such deficiencies could cause us to incur additional costs, and our management’s attention could be diverted from most effectively managing our real estate assets. In recent years, internalization transactions have been the subject of stockholder litigation. Stockholder litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that any litigation expenses we might incur would not be significant or that the outcome of litigation would be favorable to us. Any amounts we are required to expend in defending against such litigation would reduce the amount of funds available for investment by us in properties or other investments and the amount of funds available for distributions to stockholders.If we were to internalize our management or if another investment program, whether sponsored by our Sponsor or otherwise, hires the employees of our advisor in connection with its own internalization transaction or otherwise, then our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.We rely on persons employed by affiliates and the parent company of our advisor to manage our day-to-day operations. If we were to effectuate an internalization of our advisor, then we may not be able to retain all of the employees of the parent or affiliates of our advisor or to maintain a relationship with our Sponsor. In addition, some of the employees of our advisor and affiliates provide services to one or more other investment programs, including Hartman Retail III, DST and Hartman Total Return Fund, Inc. These programs or third parties may decide to retain some or all of advisor’s key employees in the future. If this occurs, then these programs could hire certain of the persons currently employed by our advisor and its affiliates who are most familiar with our business and operations, thereby potentially adversely impacting our business.If we are unable to obtain funding for future capital needs, then cash distributions to our stockholders could be reduced and the value of our investments could decline.If we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, then we may have to obtain financing from sources beyond our cash flow from operations, such as borrowings, sales of assets or future equity offerings. These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all. If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, then our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both, which would limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of an investment ins hares of our common stock.Risks Related to Conflicts of InterestOur advisor and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and other key real estate professionals, will face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us, which could result in actions that are not in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.Our advisor and its affiliates receive substantial fees from us. These fees could influence our advisor’s advice to us. Among other matters, these compensation arrangements could affect their judgment with respect to:•the continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with our advisor and its affiliates, including the advisory agreement and the property management agreements we expect to enter into with our property manager;•offerings of equity by us, which would likely entitle our advisor to increased acquisition, asset management and disposition fees;•acquisitions of properties, which would entitle our advisor to acquisition and asset management fees, and, in the case of acquisitions or investments from programs sponsored by our Sponsor or its affiliates, might entitle affiliates of our advisor to disposition fees in connection with its services for the seller;•borrowings to acquire properties and other investments, which would increase the acquisition, debt financing and asset management fees payable to our advisor;•whether and when we seek to list our common stock on a national securities exchange, which listing could entitle the holder of the special limited partnership interests to have its interests in our operating partnership redeemed; and•whether and when we seek to sell the Company or its assets, which sale could entitle our advisor to disposition fees.14The asset management fees that our advisor receives in connection with the acquisition and management of our assets are based on the cost of the investment, not on the value of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us. This may influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. Our advisor will have considerable discretion with respect to the terms and timing of acquisition, disposition and leasing transactions. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn these fees may lead our advisor to place undue emphasis on criteria relating to its compensation at the expense of other criteria, such as the preservation of capital, to achieve higher short-term compensation. Payment of fees and expenses to our advisor and our dealer manager will reduce the cash available for distribution and could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholdersOur advisor will face conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures that we may form with its affiliates, which conflicts could result in a disproportionate benefit to the other venture partners at our expense.If approved by our independent directors, then we may enter into joint venture agreements with other programs sponsored by our Sponsor or its affiliates for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties or other investments. Our advisor and the advisors to other Hartman-sponsored programs have the same executive officers and key employees; and these persons will face conflicts of interest in determining which Hartman-sponsored program should enter into any particular joint venture agreement. These persons may also face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interests of the Hartman-affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture. Any joint venture agreement or transaction between us and a Hartman-affiliated co-venturer will not have the benefit of arm’s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers. The Hartman-affiliated co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals. These co-venturers may thus be either to our and your benefit or detriment.Our advisor, the real estate professionals assembled by our advisor and their affiliates and officers will face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operations and your investment to suffer.We rely on the parent company to our advisor, the real estate professionals our advisor has assembled and their affiliates and officers for the day-to-day operation of our business. Our advisor, its real estate professionals and affiliates, including our officers, have interests in other programs sponsored by our Sponsor and its affiliates and engage in other business activities. As a result of their interests in such other programs and the fact that they have engaged in and they will continue to engage in other business activities, they will face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among us, our advisor and such other programs and other business activities in which they are involved. Should our advisor breach its fiduciary duty to us and our stockholders by inappropriately devoting insufficient time or resources to our business due to the competing demands of other programs, our operations, the returns on our investments, and therefore our profitability, may suffer.Our advisor serves also as the sponsor of the Company. Both entities are wholly owned by one individual. The concentration of control in a single individual
presents a
governance risk. This structure may lead to conflicts of interest, reduced accountability, and decisions that prioritize the sponsor’s interests over those of shareholders.Our sponsor and advisor are under the common control of a single individual. This concentration of authority may create conflicts of interest, as the same person may be incentivized to make decisions that benefit the sponsor or advisor at the expense of our stockholders. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the sponsor has a limited influence on the Company, and the independent board of directors can terminate the advisor at any time. 15Risks Related to Our Organizational StructureMaryland law and our organizational documents limit your right to bring claims against our officers and directors.Maryland law provides that a director will not have any liability as a director so long as he or she performs his or her duties in accordance with the applicable standard of conduct. In addition, our charter provides that, subject to the applicable limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages. Our charter also provides that we will generally indemnify and advance expenses to our directors, our officers, our advisor and its affiliates for losses they may incur by reason of their service in those capacities subject to any limitations under Maryland law or in our charter. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against these persons than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by these persons in some cases. However, our charter provides that we may not indemnify our directors, our advisor and its affiliates for loss or liability suffered by them or hold our directors or our advisor and its affiliates harmless for loss or liability suffered by us unless they have determined that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interests, they were acting on our behalf or performing services for us, the liability was not the result of negligence or misconduct by our non-independent directors, our advisor and its affiliates or gross negligence or willful misconduct by our independent directors, and the indemnification or obligation to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our net assets, including the proceeds of insurance, and not from the stockholders.Our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise benefit our stockholders.Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Our charter restricts the direct or indirect ownership by one person or entity to no more than 9.8% of the value of the aggregate of our then outstanding shares of capital stock (which includes common stock and any preferred stock or convertible stock we may issue) and no more than 9.8% of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of our then outstanding common stock unless exempted (prospectively or retroactively) by our board of directors. These restrictions may discourage a change of control of us and may deter individuals or entities from making tender offers for shares of our common stock on terms that might be financially attractive to stockholders or which may cause a change in our management. In addition to deterring potential transactions that may be favorable to our stockholders, these provisions may also decrease our stockholders’ ability to sell shares of our common stock.We may issue preferred stock, convertible stock or other classes of common stock, which issuance could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.  Our stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future. We may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, convertible stock or other classes of common stock with rights that could dilute the value of shares of common stock. However, the issuance of preferred stock or convertible stock must be approved by a majority of our independent directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, who will have access, at our expense, to our legal counsel or to independent legal counsel. The issuance of preferred stock or other classes of common stock could increase the number of stockholders entitled to distributions without simultaneously increasing the size of our asset base.Our charter, as amended and supplemented to date, authorizes us to issue up to 950,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 270,000,000 are classified as Class A Shares, 280,000,000 are classified as Class I Shares, 280,000,000 are classified as Class S Shares, 70,000,000 are classified as Class T Shares, and 50,000,000 are classified as shares of preferred stock without par value. Our board of directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire board of directors and without any action by our stockholders, may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of capital stock or the number of authorized shares of capital stock of any class or series. If we ever create and issue preferred stock or convertible stock with a distribution preference over common stock, then payment of any distribution preferences of outstanding preferred stock or convertible stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of distributions on our common stock. Further, holders of preferred stock are normally entitled to receive a preference payment in the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind up before any payment is made to our common stockholders, likely reducing the amount common stockholders would otherwise receive upon such an occurrence. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock or a separate class or series of common stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities and the removal of incumbent management.16Our UPREIT structure may result in potential conflicts of interest with limited partners in our operating partnership whose interests may not be aligned with those of our stockholders.We are structured as an “UPREIT,” which stands for “umbrella partnership real estate investment trust.” We use the UPREIT structure because a contribution of property directly to us is generally a taxable transaction to the contributing property owner. In the UPREIT structure, a contributor of a property who desires to defer taxable gain on the transfer of a property may transfer the property to our operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests and defer taxation of gain until the contributor later exchanges his or her limited partnership interests for shares of our common stock. We believe that using an UPREIT structure gives us an advantage in acquiring desired properties from persons who may not otherwise sell their properties because of unfavorable tax results.Our operating partnership may issue limited partner interests in connection with certain transactions. Limited partners in our operating partnership have the right to vote on certain amendments to the operating partnership agreement, as well as on certain other matters. Persons holding such voting rights may exercise them in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. As general partner of our operating partnership, we are obligated to act in a manner that is in the best interest of all partners of our operating partnership. Circumstances may arise in the future when the interests of limited partners in our operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. These conflicts may be resolved in a manner stockholders do not believe are in their best interest.In addition, the special limited partnership interest holder is an affiliate of our advisor and, as the special limited partner in our operating partnership, may be entitled to: (1) receive certain distributions upon the disposition of certain of our operating partnership’s assets; or (2) a one-time payment in the form of cash, interests in our operating partnership or shares in connection with the redemption of the special limited partnership interests upon the occurrence of a listing of our shares on a national stock exchange or certain events that result in the termination or a non-renewal of our advisory agreement. The special limited partnership interest holder will only become entitled to the compensation after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus a 6.0% cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital. This potential obligation to make substantial payments to the holder of the special limited partnership interests would reduce the overall return to stockholders to the extent such return exceeds 6.0%.Our stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks faced by our stockholders.Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of our stockholders. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board’s broad discretion in setting policies and our stockholders’ inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks faced by our stockholders.Our stockholders’ investment returns may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; if we are subject to registration under the Investment Company Act, we will not be able to continue our business.Neither we, our operating partnership nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our operating partnerships and subsidiaries’ intended investments in real estate will represent the substantial majority of our total asset mix. In order for us not to be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we engage, through our operating partnership and our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, primarily in the business of buying real estate. These investments must be made within a year after our initial public offering ends.Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the “40% test.” Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.17We believe that we, our operating partnership and most of the subsidiaries of our operating partnership will not fall within either definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as we intend to invest primarily in real property, through our operating partnership or our operating partnership’s wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, the majority of which we expect to have at least 60% of their assets in real property. As these subsidiaries would be investing either solely or primarily in real property, they would be outside of the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through our operating partnership, which in turn is a company conducting its business of investing in real property either directly or through its subsidiaries. Both we and our operating partnership intend to conduct our operations so that we comply with the 40% test. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that neither we nor our operating partnership will be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 because neither we nor our operating partnership will engage primarily or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our operating partnership or our operating partnership’s wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, we and our operating partnership will be primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real property.In the event that the value of investment securities held by a subsidiary of our operating partnership were to exceed 40% of the value of its total assets, we expect that subsidiary to be able to rely on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires each of our subsidiaries relying on this exception to invest at least 55% of its portfolio in “mortgage and other liens on and interests in real estate,” which we refer to as “qualifying real estate assets,” and maintain at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate assets or other real estate-related assets. The remaining 20% of the portfolio can consist of miscellaneous assets. What we buy and sell is therefore limited by these criteria. How we determine to classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, will be based in large measure upon no-action letters issued by the SEC staff in the past and other SEC interpretive guidance and, in the absence of SEC guidance, on our view of what constitutes a qualifying real estate asset and a real estate-related asset. These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than ten years ago. Pursuant to this guidance, and depending on the characteristics of the specific investments, certain mortgage loans, participations in mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, mezzanine loans, joint venture investments and the equity securities of other entities may not constitute qualifying real estate assets and therefore investments in these types of assets may be limited. No assurance can be given that the SEC or its staff will concur with our classification of our assets. Future revisions to the Investment Company Act of 1940 or further guidance from the SEC staff may cause us to lose our exclusion from the definition of ‘investment company’ or force us to re-evaluate our portfolio and our investment strategy. Such changes may prevent us from operating our business successfully.There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act of 1940 status of REITs, including more specific or different guidance regarding these exclusions that may be published by the SEC or its staff, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. For instance, in 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exclusion. In addition, the SEC or its staff could take action that results in our or our subsidiary’s failure to maintain an exception or exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940.In the event that we, or our operating partnership, were to acquire assets that could make either entity fall within one of the definitions of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, we believe that we would still qualify for an exclusion from registration pursuant to Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6), we believe that we and our operating partnership may rely on Section 3(c)(6) if 55% of the assets of our operating partnership consist of, and at least 55% of the income of our operating partnership is derived from, qualifying real estate assets owned by wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership.18To ensure that neither we, our operating partnership nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company, each entity may be unable to sell assets that it would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets that it would otherwise wish to retain. In addition, we, our operating partnership or our subsidiaries may be required to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise acquire or forego opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire. Although we, our operating partnership and our subsidiaries intend to monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each acquisition and disposition, any of these entities may not be able to remain outside the definition of ‘investment company’ or maintain an exclusion from the definition of an investment company. If we, our operating partnership or our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company but fail to do so, then the unregistered entity would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against such entity. In addition, the contracts of such entity would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of the entity and liquidate its business.Although we have opted out of certain anti-takeover provisions of Maryland law, our board of directors could opt into these protections in the future, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a business combination.Under Maryland law, “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as:•any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or•an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation.Another anti-takeover statute under Maryland law, the Control Share Acquisition Act, provides that the holders of “control shares” of a Maryland corporation acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights with respect to such control shares, except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, excluding votes cast by the acquirer, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation.  Should our board of directors opt into these provisions of Maryland Law in the future, it may discourage offers from third parties to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.We may become subject to certain other anti-takeover provisions of Maryland law that would make it harder for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium price for their shares in connection with an unsolicited takeover.Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, or Subtitle 8, permits the board of directors of a Maryland corporation that has a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act and that has at least three independent directors, to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in its charter or bylaws, to certain additional anti-takeover provisions, which would allow for, among other things, the classification of our board without stockholder approval and the imposition of a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director; and require that vacancies on the board of directors be filled only by the remaining directors and (if the board is classified) for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred, and a majority vote for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders. We have elected by a provision in our charter that, at such time, if ever, as we are eligible to make a Subtitle 8 election, vacancies on our board may be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred. We have not elected to be subject to the other provisions of Subtitle 8, and as discussed above, to do so we must have a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors. While we expect to meet the first of these requirements, we have only two independent directors at this time, and we have no current plan to add a third, although that may change. Accordingly, our board of directors may in the future elect, at such time as we are eligible to make a Subtitle 8 election and without stockholder approval, to classify our board or to become subject to any of the other provisions of Subtitle 8. Any of these provisions could make it more difficult and more time consuming for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium price for their shares in connection with an unsolicited takeover.19Our charter includes an anti-takeover provision that may discourage a stockholder from launching a tender offer for our shares.Our charter provides that any tender offer made by a stockholder, including any “mini-tender” offer, must comply with most of the provisions of Regulation 14D of the Exchange Act. The offering stockholder must provide our company notice of such tender offer at least ten business days before initiating the tender offer. If the offering stockholder does not comply with these requirements, then we would have the right to redeem that stockholder’s shares and any shares acquired in such tender offer. In addition, the non-complying stockholder shall be responsible for all of our company’s expenses in connection with that stockholder’s noncompliance. This provision of our charter may discourage a stockholder from initiating a tender offer for our shares and prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for your shares in such a transaction.Risks Related to Investments in Real EstateA decrease in demand for office, retail or industrial space may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of office, retail, industrial, and warehouse properties. A decrease in demand for office, retail or industrial space could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If parts of our properties are leased within a particular sector, then a significant downturn in that sector in which the tenants’ businesses operate would adversely affect our results of operations. Economic and regulatory changes that impact the real estate market generally may decrease the value of our investments and weaken our operating results.The properties we own and may subsequently acquire, and their performance, are subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, including:•
downturns in national, regional and local economic conditions;•
competition;•
adverse local conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand and changes in real estate zoning laws that may reduce the desirability of real estate in an area;•
vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;•
changes in the supply of or the demand for similar or competing properties in an area;•
changes in interest rates and the availability of permanent mortgage financing, which may render the sale of a property or loan difficult or unattractive;•
changes in governmental regulations, including those involving tax, real estate usage, environmental and zoning laws; and•
periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.Any of the above factors, or a combination thereof, could result in a decrease in the value of our investments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, reduce the cash available for distributions and the return on our stockholders’ investments.Global and U.S. market, political and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and those of our tenants.While recent economic data reflects an economic slowdown in the United States, the cost and availability of credit may continue to be adversely affected by governmental budget and global economic factors. Concern about continued stability of the economy and credit markets generally, and the strength of counterparties specifically, has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Volatility in the U.S. and international capital markets and concern over a return to recessionary conditions in global economies may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants and us. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. Further instability in foreign countries caused by political upheaval or real or threatened armed conflicts could adversely affect the U.S. and local economies, trading markets, jobs, interest rates and lending practices and may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition as well as the ability of our tenants to pay rent.20Market trends and other conditions outside of our control could decrease the value of our investments and weaken our operating results.Our performance and the value of our portfolio are subject to risks associated with our investments in real estate assets and with trends in the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our investments are subject to the risk that our properties may not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses or other obligations. A deficiency of this nature would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.Events and conditions applicable to owners and operators of real estate that are beyond our control and could impact our economic performance and the value of our portfolio may include:•local oversupply or reduction in demand for commercial space of the type we own or are purchasing, which may result in decreasing rental rates and greater concessions to tenants;•inability to collect rent from tenants;•vacancies or inability to rent space on favorable terms or at all;•inability to finance property development and acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, and real estate taxes;•costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations;•the relative illiquidity of real estate investments;•changing submarket demographics;•changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture;•the development of harmful mold or other airborne toxins or contaminants that could damage our properties or expose us to third-party liabilities; and•property damage resulting from seismic activity, flood, or other natural disasters.A downturn in oil demand or weakening of the oil and gas markets could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to borrow funds.Our investment strategy relies heavily on locating and operating properties in Texas, including properties located in the major metropolitan areas of Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. The economies of these cities rely on the exploration, production and processing of oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. A prolonged weakening in the price of oil could make oil exploration and related industries unprofitable for certain companies, forcing them out of the business or forcing them to downsize their operations. To the extent that we lease space to oil and gas companies or companies that support the oil and gas industry, our operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of tenants or less demand for space in our buildings.  To the extent that oil producers have borrowed from lending institutions and are no longer able to repay their debt, lending practices in Texas could be negatively impacted, making funds more difficult to borrow or more expensive to borrow.The loss or downsizing of a significant tenant in a property could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, ability to borrow funds and cash flows.Our financial condition, results of operations, ability to borrow funds, and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our significant tenants in a property fails to renew its lease, renews its lease on terms less favorable to us, renews for less space due to economic conditions or more efficient use of space or becomes bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy its lease obligations and we are unable to re-lease the space.If we enter into long-term leases with our tenants, then those leases may not result in fair value over time.Long-term leases do not allow for significant changes in rental payments and do not expire in the near term. If we do not accurately judge the potential for increases in market rental rates when negotiating these long-term leases, then significant increases in future property operating costs could result in receiving less than fair value from these leases. Such circumstances would adversely affect our revenues and funds available for distribution.21Downturns in our tenants’ businesses may reduce our revenues and cash flows.We derive substantially all of our revenues from continuing operations from rental income and tenant reimbursements. A tenant may experience a downturn in its business or may never generate positive results of operations, which may weaken its financial condition and result in its failure to make timely rental payments or result in defaults under our leases. For tenants that operate pursuant to capital investments, an acceleration of losses may result in a faster than expected use of available cash. In the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant also may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. If any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under federal bankruptcy law, then we would not be permitted to evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might permit the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against the tenant for unpaid and future rent could be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. Therefore, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. Any losses resulting from the bankruptcy of any of our existing tenants could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.We are subject to governmental regulations that may affect the renovations to, and use of, our properties.Our properties are subject to regulation under federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, pursuant to which all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and state and local laws addressing earthquake, fire and life safety requirements. Although we believe that our properties will substantially comply with requirements under applicable governmental regulations, it is possible that any of our properties could be audited or investigated for compliance by any regulatory agency. If we do not comply with material provisions of the ADA or other regulations affecting our properties, then we might be required to take remedial action, which could include making modifications or renovations to properties. Federal, state, or local governments may also enact future laws and regulations that could require us to make significant modifications or renovations to our properties. If we were to incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other regulations, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.We face significant competition, which may decrease the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.We compete with developers, owners and operators of office and retail properties and other commercial real estate, many of which own properties similar to the properties that we expect to acquire, in the same submarkets in which our properties are located, but which have lower occupancy rates than our properties. Therefore, our competitors have an incentive to decrease rental rates until their available space is leased. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below the rates currently charged by us for comparable space, then we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those currently charged in order to retain tenants when our tenant leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders may be adversely affected.In order to maintain the quality of our properties and successfully compete against other properties, we must periodically spend money to maintain, repair and renovate our properties, which reduces our cash flows. If our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective tenants in terms of rent, services, condition, or location as properties owned by our competitors, then we could lose tenants or suffer lower rental rates. As a result, we may from time to time be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our properties. There can be no assurances that any such expenditure would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates, or deter existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors.We may be unable to complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.Our ability to acquire properties own favorable terms and successfully operate them is subject to various risks, including the following:•we may potentially be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors;22•even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of a desired property, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions because they remain subject to customary conditions to closing, including the completion of due diligence investigations to management’s satisfaction;•we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;•we may spend more than the budgeted amount in our operations, particular in the making of necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;•we may be unable to lease acquired, developed, or redeveloped properties at projected economic lease terms or within budgeted timeframes;•we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse;•we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;•we may not complete or redevelop properties on schedule or within budgeted amounts;•we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to acquisition or redevelopment of properties that we may not complete;•we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, and other required entitlements, and building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations;•we may encounter delays, refusals, unforeseen cost increases, and other impairments resulting from third-party litigation; and•we may fail to obtain the financial results expected from properties we acquire or redevelop.If one or more of these events were to occur in connection with our acquired properties, then we could be required to recognize an impairment loss. These events could also have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.Properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your investment.A property may incur vacancies through either the expiration or the continued default of a tenant lease. Long-term vacancies would reduce our revenues and the cash available for distributions. In addition, because the value of a property’s lease has a significant impact on that property’s market value, the resale value of properties with high or prolonged vacancies could suffer, further reducing the value of an investment in our Company.We may own certain properties subject to ground leases and other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to the loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us, terminated or not renewed.We may acquire properties that we lease individually on a long-term basis. These ground leases and other restrictive agreements may impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject property, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the property or restrict our leasing of the property. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. In addition, if we default under the terms of any particular lease, we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the lease. Upon expiration of a lease, we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms, if at all. The loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase of rental expense could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.Real estate assets are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell our properties when we desire.Our investments in our properties are relatively illiquid, limiting our ability to sell our properties quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code generally imposes a 100% prohibited transaction tax on profits derived by REITs from sales of properties held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, which effectively limits our ability to sell properties other than on a selected basis. These restrictions on our ability to sell our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders.23Our advisor relies on information technology networks and systems in providing services to us, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.Risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, or otherwise, against persons inside our organization, persons with access to systems inside our organization, the U.S. government, financial markets or institutions, or major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt or disable networks and related systems, other critical infrastructures, and the normal operation of business. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Even though we may not be specifically targeted, cyber-attacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt our normal business operations and networks, which may in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations. They also may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we believe we will be able to maintain the security and integrity of these types of networks and related systems, or implement various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. While, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced any significant cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions, we may not be able to anticipate or implement adequate security barriers or other preventive measures. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could:•disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;•result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;•result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;•result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;•result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;•require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;•subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases or other agreements; or•damage our reputation among our tenants and stockholders generally.Future terrorist activity or engagement in war by the United States may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.Terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of terrorism or wars may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. In addition, the public perception that certain locations are at greater risk for attack, such as major airports, ports, and rail facilities, may decrease the demand for and the value of our properties near these sites. A decrease in demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at these sites at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist activities also could directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, or loss, and the availability of insurance for these acts may be less, and cost more, which could adversely affect our financial condition. To the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases.24Terrorist acts and engagement in war by the United States also may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade and may cause further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending and may result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of these events may cause a decline in the demand for our office leased space, delay the time in which our new or renovated properties reach stabilized occupancy, increase our operating expenses, such as those attributable to increased physical security for our properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital.From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.We may be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged acts and omissions or the alleged acts and omissions of our operators and tenants. An unfavorable resolution of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and ability to pay dividends and distributions to our stockholders. Regardless of its outcome, litigation could result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, litigation. In addition, litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were involved in pending litigation the outcome of which could cause the foregoing risks to materialize. See the Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report for further information. Our joint venture partners could take actions that decrease the value of an investment to us and lower our stockholders’ overall return.We may enter into joint ventures or other co-ownership arrangements with affiliates or with third parties having investment objectives similar to ours for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties as well as the acquisition of real estate-related investments. We may also purchase and develop properties in joint ventures or in partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with the sellers of the properties, affiliates of the sellers, developers or other persons. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present with other forms of real estate investment, including, for example:•
the possibility that our co-venturer, co-tenant or partner in an investment might become bankrupt;•
the possibility that a co-venturer, co-tenant or partner in an investment might breach a loan agreement or other agreement or otherwise, by action or inaction, act in a way detrimental to us or the investment;•
that such co-venturer, co-tenant or partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become inconsistent with our business interests or goals;•
the possibility that we may incur liabilities as the result of the action taken by our partner or co-investor; or•
that such co-venturer, co-tenant or partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, including our policy with respect to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT.Any of the above might subject a property to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and thus reduce our returns on that investment.Because we rely on our advisor, its affiliates and third-party sub-managers to manage the day-to-day affairs of any properties we may acquire, should the staff of a particular property perform poorly, our operating results for that property will similarly be hindered and our net income may be reduced.We depend upon the performance of our property managers to effectively manage our properties and real estate-related assets. In order to increase or maintain adequate occupancy levels, we may have to offer inducements, such as free rent, to compete for tenants. Poor performance by those sales, leasing and other management staff members operating a particular property will necessarily translate into poor results of operations for that particular property. Should our property manager, its affiliates or third-party sub-managers fail to identify problems in the day-to-day management of a particular property or fail to take the appropriate corrective action in a timely manner, our operating results may be hindered and our net income reduced.25If we are unable to sell a property for the price, on the terms, or within the time frame we desire, then our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders could be limited.Many factors that are beyond our control affect the real estate market and could affect our ability to sell properties for the price, on the terms, or within the time frame that we desire. These factors include general economic conditions, the availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we have a limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Further, before we can sell a property on the terms we want, it may be necessary to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements. However, we can give no assurance that we will have the funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements. We may be unable to sell our properties at a profit. Our inability to sell properties at the time and on the terms we want could reduce our cash flow and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of an investment in our company.Government entities and contractors may cause unforeseen delays and increase costs to renovate properties that we may acquire, which may reduce our net income and cash available for distributions to you.We may seek to or be required to incur substantial capital obligations to renovate or reposition existing properties that we acquire. Our advisor and its key real estate professionals will do their best to estimate these costs prior to acquisition but may not be able to ascertain all hidden defects or problems. There could be unknown and excessive costs, expenses and delays associated with a property’s renovations and interior and exterior upgrades. We will be subject to risks relating to the uncertainties associated with permits and approvals required by governmental entities, community associations and our construction manager’s ability to control costs and to build in conformity with plans and the established timeframe. We will pay a construction management fee to a construction manager, which may be one of our affiliates, if new capital improvements are required. If we are unable to increase rental rates or sell a property at a price consistent with our underwritten projections due to local market or economic conditions to offset the cost of renovating a property, then the return on an investment in our company may suffer.We may be required to make rent or other concessions and significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.In order to retain existing tenants and attract new clients, we may be required to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements and early termination rights or accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants. As a result, we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants in sufficient numbers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, if we need to raise capital to make such expenditures and are unable to do so, or such capital is otherwise unavailable, then we may be unable to make the required expenditures. This could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Costs of responding to both known and previously undetected environmental contamination and hazardous conditions may decrease our cash flows and limit our ability to make distributions.Real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health. We could be subject to liability in the form of fines, penalties or damages for noncompliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination associated with the release or disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the presence of toxic building materials, and other health and safety-related concerns.Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on the tenants, current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, whether the contamination occurred prior to purchase, or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Our tenants’ operations, the condition of properties at the time we buy them, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.26Environmental laws also may impose liens on a property or restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly manage or remediate these substances, may hinder our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. Any material expenditures, fines, penalties or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and may reduce the value of an investment in our company.Properties acquired by us may have toxic mold or asbestos that could result in substantial liabilities to us.Litigation and concern about indoor exposure to certain types of toxic molds and asbestos has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold and asbestos can cause a variety of health effects and symptoms, including allergic reactions, cancer and even death. It is impossible to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment. There can be no assurance that the properties acquired by us will not contain toxic mold or that buildings containing asbestos encased so as to render the asbestos non-health threatening will remain that way. The difficulty in discovering indoor toxic mold growth could lead to an increased risk of lawsuits by affected persons and the risk that the cost to remediate toxic mold and/or asbestos will exceed the value of the property. There is a risk that we may acquire properties that contain toxic mold and/or asbestos and such properties may negatively affect our performance and the return on an investment in our company.Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage could reduce our cash flows and the return on our stockholders’ investments.There are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential acts of terrorism or catastrophes could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism or catastrophes as a condition for providing mortgage loans. Such insurance policies may not be available at reasonable costs, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We may not have adequate coverage for such losses. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, then the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss. In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower distributions.Our properties may be dispersed geographically and across various markets and sectors.We may acquire and operate properties in different locations throughout Texas and the United States and in different markets and sectors. The success of our properties will depend largely on our ability to hire various managers and service providers in each area, market and sector where the properties are located or situated. It may be more challenging to manage a diverse portfolio. Failure to meet such challenges could reduce the value of our stockholders’ investments.We may be limited in our ability to diversify our investments, making us more vulnerable economically than if our investments were diversified.Our ability to diversify our portfolio may be limited both as to the number of investments owned and the geographic regions in which our investments are located. While we seek to diversify our portfolio by geographic location, we focus on our specified target markets that we believe offer the opportunity for attractive returns and, accordingly, our actual investments may result in concentrations in a limited number of geographic regions. As a result, there is an increased likelihood that the performance of any single property, or the economic performance of a particular region in which our properties are located, could materially affect our operating results.27Our tenants may be adversely affected by a decline in manufacturing activity in the U.S. and threat due to uncertainty of tariffs.Fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the U.S. may adversely affect our industrial tenants and therefore the demand for and profitability of any industrial properties we acquire. Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive foreign manufacturing workers. Outsourcing manufacturing activities could reduce the demand for U.S. workers, thereby reducing the profitability of our industrial tenants and the demand for and profitability of our industrial properties.Tariffs that raise costs for businesses can deter new tenants from leasing space in commercial office buildings, reducing occupancy rates and hindering the growth of commercial hubs. Tariffs on construction materials and imported goods pose a significant risk to commercial office buildings by increasing development and maintenance costs, potentially reducing profitability and delaying project timelines.Risks Associated with Debt FinancingOur use of debt will reduce cash available for distributions and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.Payments of principal and interest on our borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or to pay in cash the distributions necessary to qualify and maintain our REIT qualification. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed by our debt agreements may have substantial consequences, including the following:•
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity, or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;•
cash flows may be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments;•
we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;•
we may default on our obligations, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure the loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases; and•
our default under one mortgage loan could result in a default on other indebtedness with cross default provisions.Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected if one or more of these events were to occur.We may incur mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which increases our risk of loss due to foreclosure.We may obtain lines of credit and long-term financing that may be secured by our properties and other assets. In some instances, we may acquire real properties by financing a portion of the price of the properties and mortgaging or pledging some or all of the properties purchased as security for that debt. We may also incur mortgage debt on properties that we already own in order to obtain funds to acquire additional properties. In addition, we may borrow as necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, including borrowings to satisfy the REIT requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). We, however, can give you no assurance that we will be able to obtain such borrowings on satisfactory terms.If we mortgage a property and there is a shortfall between the cash flow from that property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on that property, then the amount of cash available for distributions to stockholders may be reduced. In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss of a property since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions. In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, reducing the value of your investment. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, then we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure even though we would not necessarily receive any cash proceeds. We may give full or partial guaranties to lenders of mortgage debt on behalf of the entities that own our properties. When we give a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity. If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, then a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.28We may also obtain recourse debt to finance our acquisitions and meet our REIT distribution requirements. If we have insufficient income to service our recourse debt obligations, then our lenders could institute proceedings against us to foreclose upon our assets. If a lender successfully forecloses upon any of our assets, then our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be limited and our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.High mortgage interest rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire, our net income and the amount of cash distributions we can make.If mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable interest rates, then we may not be able to finance the purchase of properties. If we place mortgage debt on properties, then we run the risk of being unable to refinance the properties when the loans become due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance the properties, then our income could be reduced. If any of these events occur, then our cash flow would be reduced.
This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to you and could hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money.We may not be able to access financing sources on attractive terms, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.We may finance our assets over the long term through a variety of means, including credit facilities and other structured financings. Our ability to execute this strategy will depend on various conditions in the markets for financing in this manner that are beyond our control, including lack of liquidity and greater credit spreads. If our strategy is not viable, then we will have to find alternative forms of long-term financing for our assets. This could subject us to more recourse indebtedness and the risk that debt service on less efficient forms of financing would require a larger portion of our cash flows, thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for operations, as well as for future business opportunities. Additionally, we may need to purchase a swap or cap, interest rate protection instrument, to hedge against higher interest rates. These instruments are usually expensive. We cannot be certain that these markets will remain an efficient source of long-term financing for our assets. Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.When providing financing, a lender may impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property, discontinue insurance coverage or replace our advisor. These or other limitations may limit our flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating plans.Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.We expect that we will incur indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates may increase our interest costs, which would reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of higher interest rates, we might have to sell one or more of our investments in order to repay the debt, which sale at that time might not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and decrease the value of your investment.Our charter limits our leverage to 300% of our net assets and our board of directors has adopted a policy that our debt financing will be approximately 50% of the aggregate costs of our investments but we may exceed this limit with the approval of the independent directors of our board of directors. High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments and may also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of our stockholders’ investments.29Federal Income Tax RisksFailure to qualify as a REIT would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution.We expect to operate so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist. Notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, various compliance requirements could be failed and could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, new tax legislation, administrative guidance or court decisions, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, then:  •we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which under current laws would result in, among other things, our being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates;•any resulting tax liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our book value;•unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be required to pay taxes, and thus, our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a REIT and for which we had taxable income; and•we generally would not be eligible to requalify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years.Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could adversely affect us or our stockholders.Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect us and/or our stockholders.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for taxation of individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. In addition to reducing corporate and non-corporate tax rates, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates or restricts various deductions. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and would apply only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes numerous large and small changes to the tax rules that do not affect REITs directly but may affect our stockholders and may indirectly affect us.While the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally appear to be favorable with respect to REITs, the extensive changes to non-REIT provisions in the Internal Revenue Code may have unanticipated effects on us or our stockholders. Moreover, Congressional leaders have recognized that the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review is likely to have led to drafting errors, issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that will have to be reviewed in subsequent tax legislation. At this point, it is not clear when Congress will address these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service will issue administrative guidance on the changes made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Stockholders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to the status of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on investment in our common stock.30To maintain our REIT status, we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. Our REIT taxable income will include our allocable share of any partnerships (including investment funds and joint ventures that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes) without regard to the amount, if any, of distributions we receive from such partnerships. We will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on any undistributed REIT taxable income each year. Additionally, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from previous years. Payments we make to our stockholders under our share repurchase plan will not be taken into account for purposes of these distribution requirements. If we do not have sufficient cash to make distributions necessary to preserve our REIT status for any year or to avoid taxation, then we could be forced to borrow funds or sell assets even if the market conditions at that time are not favorable for these borrowings or sales.Compliance with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities, which may hinder or delay our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.To qualify as a REIT, we are required at all times to satisfy tests relating to, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the ownership of our stock and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. Compliance with the REIT requirements may impair our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. For example, we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution.Compliance with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.To qualify as a REIT, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of our assets must consist of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than qualified real estate assets and government securities) generally cannot include more than 10% of the voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a “taxable REIT subsidiary” under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20% of the value of our assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries and not more than 25% of our assets may be represented by non-qualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we would be required to dispose a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. In order to satisfy these requirements, we may be forced to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.Our charter will not permit any person or group to own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding capital stock of all classes or series, and attempts to acquire our common stock or our capital stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 9.8% limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors.In order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock may be owned directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year after the first year for which we elect to qualify as a REIT. Our charter prohibits (unless otherwise permitted by our board of directors) beneficial or constructive ownership by any person or group of more than 9.8%, in value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock of all classes or series, which we refer to as the “ownership limits.” The constructive ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of our stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding capital stock by a person could cause another person to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock and thus violate the ownership limits. There can be no assurance that our board of directors, as permitted in the charter, will not decrease the ownership limits in the future. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our capital stock in excess of an ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors would result either in the shares in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust, and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares will not have any rights in such excess shares, or in the transfer being void.31The ownership limits may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party, even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock (and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our REIT status).We may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may become subject to U.S. federal income taxes and related state and local taxes. For example, any gain from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a REIT (a “prohibited transaction” under the Internal Revenue Code) will be subject to a 100% tax on the gain. We may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. Similarly, if we were to fail an income test (and did not lose our REIT status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect) we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll, mortgage recording and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you. In the event that a property is sold, gain is realized, but the cash is needed internally and can't be distributed to investors, a tax liability is incurred. Our board of directors is authorized to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval, which may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.Our charter authorizes our board of directors to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of our stockholders if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. Our board of directors has statutory duties to us and could cause such changes in our tax treatment only if it determines in good faith that such changes are in our best interests. In this event, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income, and we would no longer be required to distribute most of our net income to our stockholders, which may cause a reduction in the total return to our stockholders.You may have current tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our common stock.If you participate in our distribution reinvestment plan, then you will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital. Therefore, you could be forced to use funds from other sources to pay your tax liability on the reinvested dividends unless you are a tax-exempt entity.Generally, ordinary dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for reduced U.S. federal income tax rates.The maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to certain non-corporate U.S. stockholders has been reduced by legislation to 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause certain non-corporate investors to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends even taking into account the lower 37% maximum rate for ordinary income and the 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we would cease to qualify as a REIT.If the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we would be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. In the event that this were to occur, it would reduce the number of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us. This would also result in our failing to qualify as a REIT and becoming subject to a corporate-level tax on our income, which would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the yield on your investment.32Taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes.We may conduct certain activities or invest in assets through one or more TRSs. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to hotel and health care properties, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the provision of services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation.No more than 20% of the value of our total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. This requirement limits the extent to which we can conduct our activities through TRSs. The values of some of our assets, including assets that we hold through TRSs, may not be subject to precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future. Furthermore, if a REIT lends money to a TRS, then the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to the REIT, which could increase the tax liability of the TRS. In addition, as a REIT, we must pay a 100% penalty tax on certain payments that we receive if the economic arrangements between us and any of our TRSs are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. We intend to structure transactions with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm’s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above; however, the IRS may successfully assert that the economic arrangements of any of our inter-company transactions are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties.Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate risk will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if: (1) the instrument (A) hedges interest rate risk or foreign currency exposure on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets, (B) hedges risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the 75% or 95% gross income tests or (C) hedges a position entered into pursuant to clause (A) or (B) after the extinguishment of such liability or disposition of the asset producing such income; and (2) such instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations. Income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS.Retirement Plan RisksYou could be subject to criminal and civil penalties if you fail to meet the fiduciary and other standards under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code as a result of an investment in our stock.There are special considerations that apply to employee benefit plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA (such as pension, stock bonus, profit-sharing or 401(k) plans), and other retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (such as an IRAs or annuities described in Sections 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code, annuities described in Sections 403(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, Archer MSAs described in Section 220(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, health savings accounts described in Section 223(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and Coverdell education savings accounts described in Section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code) whose assets are being invested in our common stock.If you invest the assets of such a plan or arrangement in our common stock, then you should consider whether:•your investment is consistent with your fiduciary and other obligations under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code applicable to your plan or arrangement, and other applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code applicable to your plan or arrangement;•your investment is made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing your plan or IRA, including your plan or account’s investment policy;  •your investment satisfies the prudence and diversification requirements of Sections 404(a)(1)(B) and 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA and other applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code;33•your investment in our shares, for which no trading market may exist, is consistent with the liquidity needs of the plan or IRA;•your investment will not produce an unacceptable amount of “unrelated business taxable income” (UBTI) for the plan or IRA;•you will be able to comply with the requirements under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code to value the assets of the plan or IRA annually;•your investment will not constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code; and  •our assets will not be treated as “plan assets” of your plan or arrangement.You should consider whether your investment in us will cause some or all of our assets to be considered assets of an employee benefit plan, IRA, or other arrangement. We do not believe that under ERISA and U.S. Department of Labor regulations currently in effect that our assets would be treated as “plan assets” for purposes of ERISA, although there can be no assurances. However, if our assets were considered to be plan assets, then transactions involving our assets would be subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and some of the transactions we have entered into with our advisor and its affiliates could be considered “prohibited transactions,” under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code. If such transactions were considered “prohibited transactions,” then our advisor and its affiliates could be subject to liabilities and excise taxes or penalties. In addition, our officers and directors, our advisor and its affiliates could be deemed to be fiduciaries under ERISA, subject to other conditions, restrictions and prohibitions under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA and those serving as fiduciaries of plans investing in us may be considered to have improperly delegated fiduciary duties to us. Additionally, other transactions with “parties-in-interest” or “disqualified persons” with respect to an investing plan might be prohibited under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or other governing authority in the case of a government plan. Therefore, we would be operating under a burdensome regulatory regime that could limit or restrict investments we can make or our management of our real estate assets. Even if our assets are not considered to be plan assets, a prohibited transaction could occur if we or any of our affiliates is a fiduciary (within the meaning of ERISA) with respect to an employee benefit plan purchasing shares and, therefore, in the event any such persons are fiduciaries (within the meaning of ERISA) of your plan or IRA, you should not purchase shares unless an administrative or statutory exemption applies to your purchase.Failure to satisfy the fiduciary standards of conduct and other applicable requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code may result in the imposition of civil and criminal (if the violation was willful) penalties and can subject the responsible fiduciaries to claims for damages or for equitable remedies. In addition, if an investment in our common stock constitutes a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, then the “party-in-interest” or “disqualified person” who engaged in the prohibited transaction may be subject to the imposition of excise taxes with respect to the amount involved, and for IRAs or other arrangements, the tax-exempt status of the IRA or other arrangement may be lost. In the case of a prohibited transaction involving an IRA owner, the IRA may be disqualified and all of the assets of the IRA may be deemed distributed and subjected to tax. Plans that are not subject to ERISA or the prohibited transactions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as government plans or church plans, may be subject to similar requirements under state law. Such plans should satisfy themselves that the investment satisfies applicable law.Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.34Item 2.    PropertiesAs of December 31, 2022, our investments in real estate assets consist of (1) 10 wholly owned properties, (2) an 83% (approximate) tenant in common interest in an office property, (3) a 2.47% interest in an affiliate special purpose entity that owned as of December 31, 2022, 39 office, retail and light industrial properties in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, Texas, which we refer to as Hartman SPE LLC, and (4) an equity investment in an affiliated REIT.The following table sets forth certain information relating to our properties, by commercial property type, as of December 31, 2022:Property NamePropertyTypeLocationGross Leasable Area SFIn-Place OccupancyAnnualized Base Rental Revenue(in thousands)Average Base Rental Revenue per Occupied SFAverage Net Effective Annual Base Rent per Occupied SFVillage PointeRetailSan Antonio54,246 94 %$745 $14.53 $14.61 Richardson Tech CenterFlex/R&DDallas96,660 99 %667 6.946.89Spectrum BuildingOfficeSan Antonio175,390 62 %2,530 23.3923.3111211 Katy FreewayOfficeHouston77,851 97 %913 12.0812.061400 BroadfieldOfficeHouston102,893 90 %1,733 18.7318.7616420 Park Ten PlaceOfficeHouston83,760 80 %916 13.7513.59Willowbrook BuildingOfficeHouston67,581 93 %526 8.348.03Timberway IIOfficeHouston130,828 77 %1,722 17.2017.25One Park TenOfficeHouston34,089 100 %399 11.6911.61Two Park TenOfficeHouston56,443 99 %963 17.1717.173100 Weslayan (1) OfficeHouston78,289 70 %1,092 20.0420.05Grand Total958,030 83 %$12,206 $15.29 $15.25 (1) We own an approximately 83% tenant in common interest in this office property.On August 23, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Richardson Tech Center for $10,261,000. The property was acquired in March 2018 for $5,040,000. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the line of credit that we have with East West Bank by $9,337,000 and to fund a Capital Reserve account with East West Bank for $500,000. Other closing costs were covered with the remainder of the funds. Hartman SPE LLCOn October 1, 2018, we acquired a 5.89% membership interest in Hartman SPE LLC in exchange for our 48.8% minority interest in Three Forest Plaza, an office property owned jointly with Silver Star Properties REIT, Inc., formerly known as Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (“Silver Star”).
As of December 31, 2022 Hartman SPE LLC owned 39 commercial properties located in Houston, Dallas, Richardson, Arlington and San Antonio, Texas comprising approximately 6.6 million square feet. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company's ownership in Hartman SPE LLC has remained the same, but the underlying properties, and corresponding square footage within Hartman SPE LLC have decreased.Effective March 1, 2019, we exchanged 3.42% of our 5.89% interest in Hartman SPE LLC for 700,302 common shares of Silver Star.On April 14, 2020, the Company made a tender offer to the stockholders of Hartman Income REIT, Inc. ("HIREIT") to acquire up to 500,000 shares of HIREIT common stock at a price of $4.00 per share. On May 1, 2020, the Company extended the term of the tender offer until May 13, 2020, and modified the offer to purchase up 500,000 shares of HIREIT common stock at a price of $5.00 per share.
As of September 24, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of 661,940 HIREIT common shares and 80,000 Hartman Income REIT Operating Partnership ("HIROP") OP units for consideration of $3,709,703. The HIREIT common shares and HIROP OP units acquired converted to 497,926 Silver Star common shares and 60,178 Silver Star Operating Partnership OP units in connection with the merger of those two entities.35Item 3.    Legal ProceedingsDuring February 2021, the state of Texas experienced a severe winter storm, unofficially referred to as Winter Storm Uri, which resulted in power outages and electrical grid failures across the state. Wholesale prices for electricity increased significantly during this period. As a result, we experienced a substantial increase in electricity charges for some of our properties during the month of and after the storm.On May 26, 2021, Summer Energy LLC (“Summer”) filed a lawsuit against Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., the former Property Manager, an affiliate of the Silver Star that managed our properties, in state court in Harris County, Texas. In this lawsuit, Summer seeks to collect approximately $8,400,000 from the Property Manager that Summer claims that the Property Manager owes Summer under one or more electricity sales agreements (“Agreements”) related to Winter Storm Uri. Of the approximately $8,400,000 claimed in the lawsuit, approximately $800,000 relates to wholly owned properties of the Company. Under the Agreements, Summer provided electricity to buildings managed by the Property Manager at indexed prices. On March 24, 2022, the court entered a judgment in favor of Summer against the Property Manager in the amount of $7,871,000 plus customary pre- and post-judgment interest and attorney's fees. The Property Manager disputed the amount of liability to Summer and has appealed the judgment. The Company
recognized the share of the judgment amount applicable to wholly owned properties of the Company, approximately $750,000, within the Company's consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year 2021. On April 25, 2022, the property manager filed its supersedeas surety bond totaling $2,197,000 in order to suspend enforcement the judgment for the duration of the property manager's appeal. The share of the supersedeas surety bond applicable to wholly owned properties of the Company totaled $196,000 and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.On May 17, 2024, the lawsuit was dismissed upon appeal. In 2023, the Company filed suit in the District Court of Harris County, Texas against Silver Star, Hartman Income REIT Property Holdings, LLC, Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC,
Silver Star Property Management, Inc., Hartman SPE, LLC, Hartman Income REIT, Inc. and Hartman Retail I, DST. This suit includes claims for: (1) Silver Star’s breach of contract related to two loans from the Company to Silver Star; breach of contract by defendants related to Mr. Hartman’s Executive Chair Agreement; defamation; tortious interference; failure to return to the Company certain documents and information; and a request for a declaratory judgment that the Company and Mr. Hartman did not breach any fiduciary duties owed to Defendants.
Later in 2023, Silver Star filed a separate suit against the Company and Allen Hartman, Individually and as trustee for the Hartman Family Protection Trust; Lisa Hartman, individually and as trustee for the Hartman Family Protection Trust; Margaret Hartman,; Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc; and Hartman XX Holdings, Inc; in the District Court for Harris County, Texas.
This suit includes claims against the Company and the other defendants for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference, and negligent misrepresentation related to the lawsuit that we filed against them for collecting on a note receivable. The Company believes that the claims fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference, and negligent misrepresentation have no merit. Because both suits included many overlapping claims, the two suits have been consolidated into the first filed suit. Discovery is ongoing. It is anticipated that trial will be in late 2025. On September 28, 2023, Hartman SPE, LLC sued the Company in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in which it asked the court to (1) declare that the Company did not have an ownership interest in certain assets of Hartman SPE, LLC and (2) discharge lis pendens filed by the Company with respect to those assets.
On November 21, 2023, following the Company’s recordation of releases of the lis pendens, the court granted the parties’ request for a stipulated final judgment that the Company has no direct interest in Hartman SPE, LLC’s assets and that the lis pendens are discharged. There was no material impact to the Company regarding this lawsuit.
On October 19, 2023, the Company joined Allen R. Hartman in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland against Silver Star and its directors other than Mr. Hartman, which was originally filed by Mr. Hartman for the purpose of compelling an annual meeting of stockholders of Silver Star.
In this litigation, the Company and Mr. Hartman additionally asked the court to (1) compel Silver Star to provide them with a copy of Silver Star’s stock ledger, (2) declare void and unenforceable a purported amendment to Silver Star’s bylaws that allows Silver Star’s directors to be elected by less than all of its stockholders through a consent solicitation, and (3) compel Silver Star’s board of directors to liquidate Silver Star in accordance with a provision of its charter.
On November 12, 2024, the court granted Silver Star’s request to dismiss the Company as a party to the litigation.
36On January 31, 2025, Frank Gardner filed a derivative suit in the District Court for Harris County, Texas on behalf of all stockholders against several officers and directors of the Company, including Louis Fox, Allen Hartman, John Ostroot, J. Allen Quine, Richard Ruskey, and Jack Tompkins, and Silver Star. The Company is a nominal defendant in this derivative suit.
Plaintiff’s claims include breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. This claim of breach of fiduciary duty by the then Board of Directors of the Company asserts that the directors should not have authorized the Company to make unsecured loans totaling $17,187,000 to Silver Star. Discovery on this case has not yet commenced and is not anticipated to commence until 2026. Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures.Not applicable.37PART IIItem 5.     Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesStockholder InformationAs of August 20, 2025, the number of shares outstanding of each of our classes of common stock were:
(1) 8,684,819 shares of Class A common stock held by 1,502 stockholders of record; (2) 503,255 shares of Class T common stock held by 104 stockholders of record; (3) 38,198 shares of Class I common stock held by seven stockholders of record; and 19,708 shares of Class S common stock held by three stockholders of record.Market InformationOur shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or quoted or traded on any over-the-counter market. We do not expect our shares of common stock to become so listed, quoted or traded in the foreseeable future. As of January 14, 2023, the date that our follow-on offering terminated, the prices at which we sold were $11.31 per share of Class A common stock, $10.55 per share of Class S common stock, $10.17 per share of Class I common stock, and $10.83 per share of Class T common stock. The sale price of all classes of common shares to our stockholders pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan was $7.97 per share.Our board of directors has determined an estimated net asset value per share for our common stock as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 of $7.97 per share, $9.78 per share and $9.83 per share, respectively.
Our board of directors’ objective in determining the estimated net asset values per share was to arrive at values, based on the most recent data available, that it believed was reasonable based on methodologies that it deemed appropriate after consultation with our advisor. However, the market for commercial real estate can fluctuate quickly and substantially and the value of our assets is expected to change in the future and may decrease. Also, our board of directors did not consider certain other factors, such as a liquidity discount to reflect the fact that our shares are not currently traded on a national securities exchange and the limitations on the ability to redeem shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan.As with any valuation method, the methods used to determine the estimated net asset values per share were based upon a number of assumptions, estimates and judgments that may not be accurate or complete. Our assets have been valued based upon appraisal standards and the values of our assets using these methods are not required to be a reflection of market value under those standards and will not necessarily result in a reflection of fair value under GAAP. Further, different parties using different property-specific and general real estate and capital market assumptions, estimates, judgments and standards could derive a different estimated net asset value per share, which could be significantly different from the estimated net asset values per share determined by our board of directors. The estimated net asset values per share is not a representation or indication that, among other things: a stockholder would be able to realize the estimated values per share if he or she attempts to sell shares; a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated values per share upon liquidation of assets and settlement of our liabilities or upon a sale of our company; shares of our common stock would trade at the estimated net asset values per share on a national securities exchange; a third party would offer the estimated net asset values per share in an arms-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of our shares of common stock; or the methodologies used to estimate the net asset values per share would be acceptable to FINRA or ERISA with respect to their respective requirements. Further, the estimated net asset values per share were calculated as of a moment in time and the value of our shares will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, future acquisitions or dispositions of assets, developments related to individual assets and changes in the real estate and capital markets.We intend to determine updated estimated fair values per share every year on or about the last day of our fiscal year or more frequently in the sole discretion of our board of directors. The market for commercial real estate can fluctuate quickly and substantially, and values of our assets and liabilities are expected to change in the future. Equity Compensation Plan InformationPursuant to the SEC’s Regulation S-K Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 106.01, the information regarding the Corporation’s equity compensation plans required by this Item pursuant to Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K is located in Item 12 of Part III of this annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.38Distribution PolicyTo qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) to our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.For federal income tax purposes, distributions to common stockholders are characterized as ordinary dividends, capital gain distributions or nontaxable distributions. To the extent that we make distributions in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be a nontaxable return of capital which reduces the tax basis of each share of common stock held by a U.S. stockholder. The amount of distributions in excess of a U.S. stockholder’s tax basis will be a taxable gain realized upon the sale of the stockholders’ shares.The following table reflects the total distributions the Company has paid in cash, stock and pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in thousands:PeriodCash (1)DRP & Stock (2)TotalFirst Quarter 2022$1,459 $583 $2,042 Second Quarter 2022899 586 1,485 Third Quarter 2022335 565 900 Fourth Quarter 2022— — — Total$2,693 $1,734 $4,427 First Quarter 2021$566 $566 $1,132 Second Quarter 20211,117 578 1,695 Third Quarter 2021862 581 1,443 Fourth Quarter 2021 (3) 286 605 891 Total$2,831 $2,330 $5,161 (1)Distributions are paid on a monthly basis.

The delay occurred while the Company was changing stock transfer agents.Unregistered Sales of Equity SecuritiesIn 2022, the Company issued 9,833 restricted (time-vesting) shares to its independent directors as director compensation. These shares were issued in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Neither the Company nor any of its affiliated purchasers (as defined in Rule 10b-118 promulgated under the Exchange Act) purchased any shares of common stock during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. Item 6.    Reserved.39Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” preceding Part I of this Annual Report.OverviewWe were formed as a Maryland corporation on September 3, 2015 to acquire, develop and operate a diverse portfolio of value-oriented commercial properties, including office, retail, industrial and warehouse properties, located primarily in Texas. We intend to acquire properties in which there is a significant potential for growth in income and value from re-tenanting, repositioning, redevelopment, and operational enhancements. We believe that real estate, and in particular commercial real estate, provides an excellent investment for those investors looking for diversification, income and wealth preservation and growth in their portfolio. We believe that we have significant experience in acquiring and managing these types of properties, largely through our relationships with our Sponsor and other affiliates.Hartman Advisors II, LLC, which we refer to as our advisor, manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Our advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.On May 30, 2023, after one short-term extension, the Company completed a refinancing combining the MCFA, the MCFA II, and the $2,250,000 term loan into one Master Credit Facility of $53,000,000. On August 23, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Richardson Tech Center for $10,261,000. The property was acquired in March 2018 for $5,040,000. On August 23, 2024 the Master Credit Facility was reduced due to the sale of Richardson Tech Center to $42,861,000 with a loan maturity date of July 15, 2025. On August 11, 2025 the Master Credit Facility was extended from its original maturity date of July 15, 2025 to and through July 15, 2027. Management has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, due to uncertainty about the ability to meet certain loan covenant requirements of the Master Credit Facility with East West Bank. However, management believes that the Company will be able to effectively manage day-to-day operations and meet these loan covenant requirements to remain in compliance, which is expected to mitigate the covenant issue within one year of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. See Note 14 (Subsequent Events) for additional information regarding loan extensions.Upon extending our debt, we believe that we will have sufficient capital to meet our existing debt service and other operating obligations for the next year and that we have adequate resources to fund our cash needs. While management has identified substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern due to uncertainty around meeting certain loan covenant requirements under the Master Credit Facility with East West Bank, we believe we will be able to effectively manage day-to-day operations and maintain compliance with these covenants. This is expected to mitigate the covenant-related concerns within one year of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. However, our operations remain subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in national economic conditions, restricted financing availability, demographic shifts, interest rate fluctuations, and declining real estate valuations. As a result of these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we will meet our investment objectives or that these risks will not adversely affect our properties or financial results.40Substantially all of our business is conducted through Hartman vREIT XXI Operating Partnership, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and Hartman vREIT XXI Holdings LLC, and Hartman vREIT XXI SLP, LLC, affiliates of our advisor, are the initial limited partners of our operating partnership. As we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock, we will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to our operating partnership as a capital contribution. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that our operating partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our operating partnership will not be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which classification could result in our operating partnership being taxed as a corporation rather than as a partnership. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our operating partnership in acquiring and operating our investments, our operating partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our operating partnership. We will experience a relative increase in liquidity as additional subscriptions for shares of our common stock are received and a relative decrease in liquidity as offering proceeds are used to acquire and operate our assets.We elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied or lost.
Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations.Review of our Investment Policies Our board, including our independent directors, has reviewed our investment policies as described in this Annual Report and determined that such policies are in the best interests of the Company based on the following factors: (1) such policies increase the likelihood that we will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income producing properties, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (2) our executive officers and directors and the affiliates of our advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; (3) there are sufficient property acquisition opportunities with the attributes that we seek; and (4) borrowings should enable us to purchase assets and earn income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates General We consider the accounting policies described below to be critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management’s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions is different, then it is possible that different accounting policies would be applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses would be recorded, resulting in a different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.Income Taxes  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing in the taxable year ended
December 31, 2017. As a REIT we generally are not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year after the year in which we initially elected to be treated as a REIT, then we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income. However, we believe that we are organized and will operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.41We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We record a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized.For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred a net loss of $1,930,000 and $2,206,000, respectively.  We do not anticipate forming any taxable REIT subsidiaries or otherwise generating future taxable income which may be offset by the net loss carry forward.  We consider that any deferred tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset which may be recorded in light of the net loss carry forward would be properly offset by an equal valuation allowance in that no future taxable income is expected. Accordingly, no deferred tax benefit or deferred tax asset has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.Management has reviewed our tax positions and is of the opinion that material positions taken by us would more likely than not be sustained upon examination.  Accordingly, we have not recognized a liability related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The updated guidance requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This is different from the current guidance as this will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets.
Generally, the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after January 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2016-13 from January 1, 2023. This adoption will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity can elect to apply the amendments as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to that date that the financial statements are available to be issued. In October 2022, the FASB approved a two-year extension of the temporary accounting relief provided under ASU 2020-04 to December 31, 2024.For the period from January 1, 2020 (the earliest date the Company may elect to apply ASU 2020-04) through December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any contract modifications impacting current reference rates. The Company's SASB Loan and derivative instrument use LIBOR as the current reference rate. The optional expedients for hedging relationships described in ASU 2020-04 are not expected to have an impact to the Company.In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires the disclosure of incremental segment information, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to net income. The title and position of the CODM must also be disclosed, along with how the CODM uses the reported measures to assess segment performance and to allocate resources. Entities with a single reportable segment (such as the Company) will be required to provide the disclosures required by Topic 280, as amended. The standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024 and the required disclosures for the Company will begin with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. With the Company having only one segment, the adoption, effective January 1, 2024, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.42In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance focuses on providing more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Pursuant to this ASU, the footnotes to the Company's consolidated financial statements may include incremental disclosures related to income taxes. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, therefore, compliance with this ASU will be required beginning with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this ASU for its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025, and is continuing to research the impact of this amended guidance, however, does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2024 and January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 and ASU No. 2025-01, respectively. Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ("Update 2024-03"), which requires companies to disclose additional information for certain relevant expense categories in the Statements of Operations and within the notes to the financial statements. Update 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted and can be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or retrospectively to prior periods which are presented in the financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Inflation Although inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties, inflation has recently increased in the United States. Monetary policy and stimulus measures implemented by the federal government and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher inflation rates or lengthen the period of inflation, which may negatively impact our tenants, our operating costs, and our construction costs. Our increased use of net lease agreements mitigates the adverse effect of inflation, including rent escalations and requirements for tenants to pay their allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and insurance. Additionally, many of our leases are for terms less than ten years, which allows us to target increased rents to current market rates upon renewal. TariffsFluctuations in manufacturing activity in the U.S. may adversely affect our industrial tenants and therefore the demand for and profitability of any industrial properties we acquire. Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive foreign manufacturing workers. Outsourcing manufacturing activities could reduce the demand for U.S. workers, thereby reducing the profitability of our industrial tenants and the demand for and profitability of our industrial properties.Tariffs that raise costs for businesses can deter new tenants from leasing space in commercial office buildings, reducing occupancy rates and hindering the growth of commercial hubs. Tariffs on construction materials and imported goods pose a significant risk to commercial office buildings by increasing development and maintenance costs, potentially reducing profitability and delaying project timelines.43REIT Compliance We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. To qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined for this purpose without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year following the taxable year in which we initially elect to be taxed as a REIT, then we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We did not meet all of the qualifications to be a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the period from September 3, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2016.Our Real Estate InvestmentsAs of December 31, 2022, our investments in real estate assets consist of ten properties listed below, a 2.47% interest in an affiliate special purpose entity that owned as of December 31, 2022, 39 office, retail and light industrial properties in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, Texas, which we refer to as the Hartman SPE LLC, and an 83% (approximate) tenant in common interest in an office property located in Houston, Texas.Property NameYearSpace TypeGross Leasable Area SFIn-Place OccupancyNo. of TenantsAnnualized Base Rental Revenue (in thousands)Average Base Rental Revenue per Occupied SFAcquisition Price (in thousands)Encumbrances (1) (in thousands)Village Pointe1982Retail54,246 94 %15745 14.53$7,226 Richardson Tech Center1987Flex/R&D96,660 99 %20667 6.94$5,165 $2,411 Spectrum Building1986Office175,390 62 %462,530 23.39$16,951 $35,000 11211 Katy Freeway1976Office77,851 97 %87913 12.08$4,495 1400 Broadfield1982Office102,893 90 %331,733 18.73$9,581 16420 Park Ten Place1982Office83,760 80 %38916 13.75$7,511 Willowbrook Building1982Office67,581 93 %44526 8.34$3,972 Timberway II1982Office130,828 77 %521,722 17.20$11,891 $15,625 One Park Ten1982Office34,089 100 %37399 11.69$3,075 Two Park Ten1982Office56,443 99 %27963 17.17$5,125 3100 Weslayan (2)1980Office78,289 70 %371,092 20.04$3,758 Grand Total958,030 83 %43612,206 15.29$78,750 $53,036 (1)    Specific encumbrances represent mortgage loans secured by the property indicated. See also Note 8 to consolidated financial statements.(2)     We own an approximately 83% tenant in common interest in this office property.On August 23, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Richardson Tech Center, a premier four-building, multi-tenant portfolio located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, for $10,261,000.
The property was acquired in March 2018 for $5,040,000. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the line of credit that we have with East West Bank by $9,337,000 and fund a Capital Reserve account with East West Bank for $500,000. Other closing costs were covered with the remainder of the funds. Hartman SPE LLCOn October 1, 2018, we acquired a 5.89% member interest in Hartman SPE LLC in exchange for our 48.8% minority interest in Three Forest Plaza, an office property owned jointly with Silver Star Properties REIT, Inc, formerly Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc (“Silver Star”).
As of December 31, 2022 Hartman SPE LLC owned 39 commercial properties located in Houston, Dallas, Richardson, Arlington and San Antonio, Texas comprising approximately 6.6 million square feet.44Effective March 1, 2019, we exchanged 3.42% of our 5.89% interest in Hartman SPE LLC for 700,302 common shares of Silver Star Properties REIT, Inc, formerly Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (“Silver Star”). Hartman 3100 WeslayanOn December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an approximately 83% tenant in common interest in and office property located at 3100 Weslayan Street, Houston, Texas.
Results of OperationsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owned 10 properties comprising approximately 879,741 and 879,741 square feet, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owned a 2.47% interest in an affiliate special purpose entity that owns 39 office, retail and light industrial properties in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio, Texas, which is referred to as the Hartman SPE interest. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owed an 83% (approximate) tenant in common interest in an office property comprising approximately 78,289 square feet located at 3100 Weslayan Street in Houston, Texas, which was acquired on December 29, 2020.
Revenues – The primary source of our revenue is rental revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had total rental revenues and tenant reimbursements of $13,461,000 and $12,905,000, respectively. The increase in 2022 was mainly due to increase in overall occupancy from 71% as of December 31, 2021 to 83% as of December 31, 2022.Property operating expenses – Property operating expenses consist of contract services, repairs and maintenance, utilities and management fees. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had property operating expenses of $4,697,000 and $5,357,000, respectively. Fees to affiliates – We pay asset management fees to our advisor in connection with the management of our company. Asset management fees to our advisor were $553,000 for the each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.Real estate taxes and insurance – Real estate taxes and insurance were $2,370,000 and $2,382,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization – Depreciation and amortization were $4,313,000 and $5,520,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in 2022 was primarily related to a decrease in amortization expense of our in-place lease value intangibles, which typically have a shorter useful life compared to other real estate asset components.Equity in losses of tenancy in common interest - Equity in net loss of tenant in common interest was $330,000 and $540,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net loss of tenant in common interest in 2022 was due to Winter Storm Uri. The Weslayan property was impacted by the storm and experienced an increase in electricity utility billings for the months of February and March 2021.Impairment expense on investments – As of December 31, 2022, Hartman held 1,258,406 shares of Silver Star Properties REIT, Inc. ("Silver Star”). Impairment testing conducted on this investment resulted in the recognition of an impairment expense of $502,000, compared to no impairment expense recognized as of December 31, 2021.General and administrative – General and administrative expenses were $1,981,000 and $1,416,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of audit fees, transfer agent fees, other professional fees, and independent director’s compensation. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2022 was primarily due to increase in professional fees associated with unsuccessful refinancing efforts in 2022 for the combined Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. and Silver Star portfolio.
Interest expense - Interest expense was $2,595,000 and $1,226,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to an overall increase in notes payable and interest rates from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. Interest and dividend income - Interest and dividend income was $1,991,000 and $1,927,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to additions to related party notes receivable, offset with a reduction of dividend income as Silver Star Properties suspended distributions to it stockholders, including the Company, in July 2022.45Net loss – We generated a net loss of $1,930,000 and $2,206,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year reduction in net loss of $276,000. Total revenue increased by $556,000 in 2022 compared to the prior year. However, this increase was partially offset by the recognition of a $502,000 provision for impairment loss on investment during the same period. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1,207,000, while interest expense increased by $1,369,000, as further discussed in the respective sections above. Additionally, a $210,000 decrease in equity in losses of tenancy in common interest primarily attributable to a decrease in electricity expense. The combination of these key variances contributed to the slight year-over-year improvement in net loss for 2022.46Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThrough our stock offerings, as of December 31, 2022, we had accepted subscriptions for, and issued, 8,706,919 Class A Shares, net of redemptions, including 840,901 shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, 38,198 Class I Shares, 19,708 Class S Shares, and 503,255 Class T Shares, net of redemptions, including 40,380 shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $91,699,487.Our principal demands for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related acquisitions, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions to our stockholders, and for the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness.  Generally, we expect to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions from our cash flow from operations, and we expect to meet cash needs for acquisitions from the net proceeds of our initial public offering and from financings.We intend to borrow money to acquire properties and make other investments. There is no limitation on the amount we may invest in any single property or other asset or on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any individual property or other investment.  Under our charter, we are prohibited from borrowing over 300% of the value of our “net assets” (as defined by our charter). However, we may temporarily exceed that limit if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors and if disclosed to the stockholders in the next quarterly report along with the explanation for such excess borrowings. In addition, our board of directors has adopted a policy to generally limit our aggregate borrowings to approximately 50% of the aggregate value of our assets unless substantial justification exists that borrowing a greater amount is in our best interests; provided, however, that such policy limitation does not apply to individual real estate assets and only will apply once we have ceased raising capital under our initial public offering or any subsequent public offering and invested substantially all of our capital. As a result, we expect to borrow more than 50% of the contract purchase price of each real estate asset we acquire to the extent our board of directors determines that borrowing these amounts is prudent.  Our policy of limiting our aggregate borrowings to approximately 50% of the aggregate value of our assets relates primarily to mortgage loans and other debt that will be secured by our properties. The charter limitation of 300% of the value of our net assets includes secured and unsecured indebtedness that we may issue. We do not anticipate issuing significant amounts of unsecured debt and therefore we intend to limit the balance of our borrowings to 50% of the contract purchase price of our assets. We may, but are not required to, establish capital reserves from gross offering proceeds, out of cash flow generated by operating properties and other investments or out of non-liquidating net sale proceeds from the sale of our properties and other investments. Capital reserves are typically utilized for non-operating expenses such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions and major capital expenditures. Alternatively, a lender may require its own formula for escrow of capital reserves. Potential future sources of capital include proceeds from additional private or public offerings of our securities, secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $4,898,000 and $5,114,000, respectively, representing a year-over-year decrease of $216,000 primarily due to $712,000 more increase in account receivable in 2022, partially offset by $616,000 less increase in deferred leasing commissions in 2022.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $16,466,000 and $4,310,000, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing in 2022 was primarily due to the issuances of notes receivable to related parties of $9,083,000. The Company increased issuances of notes receivable to related parties during 2022 to realize the spread between the 10% interest rate earned
and the interest paid. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from our stock offerings and debt financing.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $12,130,000 and $(1,207,000), respectively. Cash flows from financing activities increased in 2022 mainly due to an increase of $12,944,000 in proceeds from a revolving credit facility.47Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, which we believe is an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a real estate investment trust, or REIT in conjunction with net income. FFO is used by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT’s policy described above. We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA’s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of its liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund its cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed.
FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO or MFFO. Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and as a result we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO. 48The table below summarizes our calculation of FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial performance measures to our net loss, in thousands. December 31, 20222021Net loss$(1,930)$(2,206)Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets4,313 5,520 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of unconsolidated tenant in common interest619 619 FFO attributable to unconsolidated entity, Hartman SPE, LLC (1)534 446 Funds from operations (FFO)$3,536 $4,379 Organization and offering costs41 44 Modified funds from operations (MFFO)$3,577 $4,423 (1) The Company's share of Hartman SPE, LLC FFO is based on the below financial data.Hartman SPE, LLCDecember 31,20222021Net loss$(27,082)$(6,284)Depreciation and amortization expense24,544 24,321 Impairment loss$24,160 $— FFO$21,622 $18,037 Weighted average ownership2.47 %2.47 %DistributionsEffective December 16, 2022, our board of directors suspended the payment of monthly distributions to preserve capital and secure our financial health on an ongoing basis.

Distributions for all record dates of a given month were paid approximately 20 days following the end of such month. Distributions for the month of October 2021 and November 2021, which normally would have been paid in November 2021 and December 2021, were not paid until January 2022. The delay occurred while the Company was changing to a stock transfer agent.49For the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid aggregate distributions of $4,427,000, including $2,693,000 in cash and $1,734,000 in shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. During the same period, cash provided by operating activities was $4,898,000 and our FFO was $3,536,000. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 51% of distributions in cash were paid from net cash provided by operating activities.For the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid aggregate distributions of $5,161,000, including $2,831,000 in cash and $2,330,000 in shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. During the same period, cash provided by operating activities was $5,114,000 and our FFO was $4,379,000. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 55% of distributions were paid from net cash provided by operating activities.During the period from our inception to December 31, 2022, our cash provided by operating activities was $14,631,000, our net loss was $10,101,000 and our FFO was $16,137,000. Of the $21,777,000 in aggregate distributions paid to our stockholders from inception to December 31, 2022, 65% was paid from net cash provided by operating activities and 35% was funded from offering proceeds. For a discussion of how we calculate FFO, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.”Our long-term policy is to pay distributions solely from funds from operations. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period, and we expect to pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, our board of directors has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to fund distributions from sources such as borrowings, offering proceeds or advances and the deferral of fees and expense reimbursements by our advisor, in its sole discretion. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use from sources other than cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, then we will have fewer funds available for investments.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Recent Accounting PronouncementsManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with our advisor and its affiliates whereby we have paid, and may continue to pay, certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our advisor and its affiliates. See Item 13 of Part III of this Annual Report and Note 9 (Related Party Arrangements) to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.Subsequent EventsOn February 14, 2023, the Company sent notice to Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., who was then serving as the Company’s property manager, and Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC, who was then serving as the Company’s advisor, terminating the respective property management and advisory agreements. Effective April 17, 2023, we terminated our advisory agreement with Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC and our property management agreement with Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc. Both entities no longer provide management and advisory services to Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. and its affiliates. Effective April 17, 2023, we entered into an advisory agreement of Hartman Advisors II, LLC and a property management agreement with REIT Property Management, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors II, LLC. Allen R. Hartman is the sole member of Hartman Advisors II, LLC.
50On May 30, 2023, we completed a refinancing that combined our $35,000,000, $20,000,000 and $2,250,000 loans and credit facility into one Master Credit Facility of $53,000,000.
On August 23, 2024, we completed the sale of Richardson Tech Center for $10,261,000. The property was acquired in March 2018 for $5,040,000. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the line of credit that we have with East West Bank by $9,337,000 and fund a Capital Reserve account with East West Bank for $500,000. Other closing costs were covered with the remainder of the funds. On August 23, 2024 the Master Credit Facility was reduced due to the sale of Richardson Tech Center to $42,861,000 and the original maturity date has been subsequently amended to be July 15, 2025. On August 11, 2025 the Master Credit Facility was extended from its original maturity date of July 15, 2025 to and through July 15, 2027. Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RisksNot required.Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThe consolidated financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item 8 can be found beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report.Item 9.      Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.51Item 9A.     Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer (the “PEO”) and our principal financial officer (the “PFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls or procedures, no matter how well designed it operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.Our management, with the participation of the PEO and the PFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the PEO and the PFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.During the fourth quarter of 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Since December 31, 2022, however, management has begun implementing remediation plans to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting contained in management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting.
The remediation plan for the first material weakness includes enhancing our policies and procedures around identifying related party transactions, approval thresholds, disclosure requirements, and strengthening documentation standards to ensure transactions with related parties are appropriately evaluated, reviewed, approved, and disclosed. The remediation plan for the second material weakness includes implementation of a fiscal year-end evaluation procedure to determine if recognition of an estimated recovery is warranted. We believe these actions will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting; however, some of these actions will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and will make any further changes management determines appropriate.As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has performed an evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting is included on the following page.Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement of Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management another personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting in the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally excepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) and include those policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of our assets;•provide reasonable assurance the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally excepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and our directors; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention of timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.52Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and the Company’s principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report, our management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and the Company’s principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making that assessment, our management used the framework and criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting discussed below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.As of December 31, 2022, the following material weaknesses existed:1Ineffective investment policies and procedures related to the investment by the Company in loans to affiliates, and2
The insufficient operation of controls in the review of the completeness and accuracy of financial statement disclosures. Regarding the first material weakness above, management has determined that the Company’s investment policy and procedures related to the investment by the Company in loans to affiliates, specifically loans and advances to Silver Star Properties REIT, Inc., formerly Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (“Silver Star”), were not effective due to material weakness in the design of the control, or lack thereof, for the proper approval of investing decisions specifically related to loans and investments in affiliates. Management has determined that the Company has made loans to Silver Star pursuant to an intercompany promissory note, in excess of the face amount of such promissory note without the prior authorization and approval of the board of directors. The making of loans and investments in affiliates, as described, resulted from a lack of adequate investment policy and procedures with respect to such matters.The second material weakness is the result of insufficient financial statement disclosure surrounding a financing agreement executed in the first quarter of 2021. Under the agreement, a property wholly owned by one of our affiliates was added to one of our credit facilities. During the ongoing renewal of the credit facility, the review of organizational and other financing documents required the Company to further evaluate whether the property should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the periods ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, and related interim periods.Notwithstanding this material weakness, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Audit CommitteeOur board of directors has established an audit committee, the members of which are Messrs. Ostroot and Quine.
The audit committee’s function is to assist our board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing: (1) the systems of our internal accounting and financial controls; (2) our financial reporting processes; (3) the independence, objectivity and qualification of our independent Registered Public Accounting Firms; (4) the annual audit of our financial statements; and (5) our accounting policies and disclosures. The audit committee meets on a regular basis, at least quarterly and more frequently as necessary.The board of directors has determined that Mr. Quine qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined by the SEC in Item 407 of Regulation S-K.
During 2022, until their respective resignations from our board of directors, Messrs. Ruskey and Tompkins served on the Audit Committee and were deemed to be “independent directors” as defined in our charter.
The board of directors determined that Mr. Ruskey was an “audit committee financial expert” during 2022.Delinquent Section 16(a) ReportsSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires each director, officer and individual beneficially owning more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC, within specified time frames, initial statements of beneficial ownership (Form 3) of our common stock and statements of changes in beneficial ownership (Forms 4 and 5) of our common stock. These specified time frames require the reporting of changes in ownership within two business days of the transaction giving rise to the reporting obligation. Reporting persons are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed with the SEC.

See also Note 9 (Related Party Arrangements) to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our independent directors are specifically charged with and have examined the fairness of such transactions to our stockholders, and have determined that all such transactions are fair and reasonable to us.Ownership InterestsAs of December 31, 2022, Hartman XXI Holdings owned 100% of the outstanding limited partnership interests in our operating partnership and Hartman XXI SLP owned 100% of the special limited partnership interests issued by our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership.Pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership, Hartman XXI SLP, as the holder of the special limited partnership interests, will be entitled to receive distributions equal to 15.0% of our operating partnership’s net sales proceeds from the disposition of assets, but only after our stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their total invested capital plus a 6.0% cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such aggregated invested capital. In addition, the holder of the special limited partnership interests is entitled to receive a payment upon the redemption of the special limited partnership interests. Pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership, the special limited partnership interests will be redeemed upon: (1) the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange; (2) the occurrence of certain events that result in the termination or non-renewal of our advisory agreement with our advisor other than by us for “cause” (as defined in the advisory agreement); or (3) the termination of the advisory agreement by us for cause. In the event of the listing of our shares of common stock or a termination of the advisory agreement other than by us for cause, the special limited partnership interests will be redeemed for an aggregate amount equal to the amount that the holder of the special limited partnership interests would have been entitled to receive under the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership if our operating partnership had disposed of all of its assets at their fair market value and all liabilities of our operating partnership had been satisfied in full according to their terms as of the date of the event triggering the redemption. Payment of the redemption price to the holder of the special limited partnership interests will be paid, at the holder’s discretion, in the form of (i) limited partnership interests in our operating partnership, (ii) shares of our common stock, or (iii) a non-interest bearing promissory note. If the event triggering the redemption is a listing of our shares on a national securities exchange only, then the fair market value of the assets of our operating partnership will be calculated taking into account the average share price of our shares for a specified period. If the event triggering the redemption is an underwritten public offering of our shares, then the fair market value will take into account the valuation of the shares as determined by the initial public offering price in such offering. If the triggering event of the redemption is the termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement other than by us for cause for any other reason, then the fair market value of the assets of our operating partnership will be calculated based on an appraisal or valuation of our assets. In the event of the termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement by us for cause, all of the special limited partnership interests will be redeemed by our operating partnership for the aggregate price of $1. As the holder of special limited partnership interests, Hartman XXI SLP is not entitled to receive any other distributions.Our Relationships with our Advisor and our Property Manager Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC was our advisor until April 16, 2023 and, as such, supervised and managed our day-to-day operations and selects our real property investments and real estate-related investments, subject to the oversight by our board of directors.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not pay our advisor any debt financing fees.•If our advisor provides a substantial amount of services, as determined by our independent directors, in connection with the sale of one or more assets, then it will receive a disposition fee equal to (1) in the case of the sale of real property, the lesser of: (A) one-half of the aggregate brokerage commission paid (including the disposition fee) or, if none is paid, the amount that customarily would be paid, or (B) 3% of the sales price of each property sold, and (2) in the case of the sale of any asset other than real property, 3% of the sales price of such asset.

When recorded by us, organization costs will be expensed as incurred, and offering costs, which include selling commissions, dealer manager fees and all other underwriting compensation, will be deferred and charged to stockholder’s equity as such amounts are reimbursed or paid to the advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates from the gross proceeds of our initial public offering.•Pursuant to our advisory agreement and our charter, we will reimburse our advisor for all operating expenses paid or incurred by our advisor in connection with the services provided to us.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our total operating expenses were $15,391,000.

Our charter defines independent director in accordance with the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.’s Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts, as revised and adopted on May 7, 2007.

An indirect association with the Sponsor or the advisor shall include circumstances in which a director’s spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, or brother- or sister-in-law is or has been associated with the Sponsor, the advisor, any of their affiliates, or with us.We have a three-member board of directors.

Quine and Ostroot, who comprise the majority of our board, qualify as independent directors as defined in our charter.

The audit committee reserves the right to select a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time in the future in its discretion if it deems such decision to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.  Pre-Approval PoliciesThe charter of our audit committee imposes a duty on the audit committee to pre-approve all audit and audit-related services performed for us by our independent auditors as well as all permitted non-audit services in order to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditors’ independence. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the audit committee will consider whether the service is a permissible service under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The audit committee, may, in its discretion, delegate to one or more of its members the authority to pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors, provided any such approval is presented to and approved by the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.All services rendered to us by Weaver for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were pre-approved in accordance with the policies and procedures described above.63Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm FeesThe audit committee reviewed the audit and non-audit services performed by Weaver, as well as the fees charged by Weaver for such services.

(a Maryland corporation) and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Going ConcernThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, uncertainty exists regarding the Company’s ability to meet certain loan covenant requirements, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by F-1communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment (Note 2)Critical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company evaluates, on at least an annual basis, its real estate assets for potential impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the value of real estate assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.We identified the evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment and management’s related determination of fair value as a critical audit matter. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in determining the recoverability of these real estate assets. Management’s impairment analysis of its real estate assets was also significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the consolidated financial statements. Auditing management’s assessment is complex and involves significant judgment as the Company’s ability to estimate future cash flows could be impacted by various economic and industry conditions as well as the Company’s assumptions.How we addressed the matter in our auditWe obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management’s controls with respect to their impairment analysis and evaluated the inputs used and underlying significant assumptions. Our testing of the Company's impairment analysis included, among other procedures, evaluating the methods, data and underlying significant assumptions used to develop the estimated cash flows and related fair value estimates, testing the accuracy and completeness of operating data used in the calculation, identifying capitalization rates by geographic market, assessing the reasonableness of the market-specific capitalization rates, and performing a sensitivity analysis of the underlying significant assumptions to evaluate the potential changes in the fair value estimates. We also utilized an auditor specialist to assist in estimating the fair values based upon recent market comparable transactions.Presentation and disclosure of related party transactions (Note 9)Critical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company has a material amount of related party transactions as it regularly transacts with multiple other Hartman affiliates in the normal course of business.Auditing the presentation and disclosure of these related party transactions, including the completeness thereof, was challenging due to the affiliates’ involvement in many aspects of the Company’s business, including (1) entities with common management, (2) formal and informal affiliate borrowings and advances, and (3) informal documentation governing such transactions.How we addressed the matter in our auditWe obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of controls over the Company’s process of identifying and disclosing related party transactions. F-2To test the completeness of related party transactions, a listing of all related party relationships was compared to the Hartman affiliates’ legal structure and evidence obtained from other audit procedures including, among others, inquiries of management and the audit committee, review of the board of directors and other committee meeting minutes, and review of contracts. We also performed procedures to test material related party account activity and account balances including, among others, testing the related party amounts and disclosures of transactions recognized in the statement of operations and balance sheet accounts by inspecting source documentation, and evaluating the aggregated presentation and disclosure of related party transactions. /s/ Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P.WEAVER AND TIDWELL, L.L.P.We have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.Houston, TexasAugust 22, 2025 F-3HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 — OrganizationHartman vREIT XXI, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation formed on September 3, 2015. The Company elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.In its initial public offering, the Company offered to the public up to $250,000,000 in any combination of shares of Class A and Class T common stock and up to $19,000,000 in shares of Class A and Class T common stock to stockholders pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan.  The Company's follow-on offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 14, 2020. In its follow-on offering, the Company registered $180,000,000 in any combination of shares of Class A and Class T common stock to be offered to the public and $5,000,000 to be offered to stockholders pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan.On May 12, 2020, the Company's board of directors authorized the classification and designation of Class I and Class S common stock. As of December 31, 2020, 900,000,000 shares of capital stock are classified as common stock, par value $0.01 per share of which 270,000,000 shares classified and designated as Class A common stock
(“Class A Shares”), 280,000,000 shares classified and designated as Class S common stock ("Class S Shares"), 280,000,000 shares classified and designated as Class I common stock ("Class I Shares"), and 70,000,000 shares classified and designated as Class T Common stock (“Class T Shares”).Effective December 31, 2022, the sale prices of our Class A, Class S, Class I and Class T common shares to the public were $9.11, $8.35, $7.97 and $8.63 per share, respectively, representing the net asset value per share as determined by the board of directors plus the applicable sales commissions and managing broker dealer fees. The last sale price of all classes of common shares to our stockholders pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan was $9.83 per share.The Company’s board of directors may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, change the price at which the Company offers shares to the public in the follow-on offering or pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan to reflect changes in estimated value per share and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.Effective January 14, 2023, the initial public offering and follow on offering was terminated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s advisor is Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”), a Texas limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors, LLC. Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor, is the Company’s sponsor and property manager (“Sponsor” and “Property Manager”). The Advisor and the Property Manager are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Silver Star Properties REIT. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor is responsible for managing the Company’s affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and investments on behalf of the Company.On February 14, 2023, the Company sent notice to Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., who was then serving as the Company’s property manager, and Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC, who was then serving as the Company’s advisor, terminating the respective property management and advisory agreements. On April 17, 2023, the Company terminated the advisory agreement with Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC and property management agreement with Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc. Both entities no longer provide management and advisory services to Hartman vREIT XXI, Inc. and its affiliates. On April 17, 2023, the Company executed an advisory agreement of Hartman Advisors II, LLC and a property management agreement with REIT Property Management, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors II, LLC. Allen R. Hartman is the sole member of Hartman Advisors II, LLC.  F-9 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSubstantially all the Company’s business is conducted through Hartman vREIT XXI Operating Partnership, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (the “OP”). The Company is the sole general partner of the OP. The initial limited partners of the OP are Hartman vREIT XXI Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“XXI Holdings”), and Hartman vREIT XXI SLP LLC (“SLP LLC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors, LLC. SLP LLC has invested $1,000 in the OP in exchange for a separate class of limited partnership interests (the “Special Limited Partnership Interests”). As the Company accepts subscriptions for shares, it will transfer substantially all the net proceeds of the offering to the OP as a capital contribution.
The partnership agreement provides that the OP will be operated in a manner that will enable the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the OP will not be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), which classification could result in the OP being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a partnership.  In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by the OP in acquiring and operating real properties, the OP will pay all the Company’s administrative costs and expenses and such expenses will be treated as expenses of the OP.As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accepted investors' subscriptions for, and issued 9,268,080 shares, net of redemptions, of its Class A Shares, Class T Shares, Class S Shares, and Class I Shares in its initial public offering, including
19,708 Class S shares issued as stock distributions and pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan resulting in gross offering proceeds of $91,699,487. Our follow-on offering and initial public offering expired on January 14, 2023.We do not expect to register additional securities for sale to the public in the foreseeable future.F-10 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Form 10-K, Regulation S-K, and Regulation S-X. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the financial position and operating results for the respective periods.The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and the accounts of its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of demand deposits at commercial banks. As of December 31 2021, the Company had a bank overdraft of $184,000. The overdraft is recorded as a liability in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted CashRestricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consists of amounts escrowed for future real estate taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and debt service, as required by certain mortgage debt agreements.Financial InstrumentsThe accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, accrued rent and accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable, net and balance with related parties. The Company considers the carrying value, other than notes payable, net, to approximate the fair value of these financial instruments based on the short duration between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of its notes payable approximates fair value.Revenue RecognitionThe Company’s leases are accounted for as operating leases. Certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due and/or for increases or decreases in the minimum lease payments over the terms of the leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the individual leases. Revenue recognition under a lease begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space. When the Company acquires a property, the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. The Company’s accrued rents are included in accrued rent and accounts receivable, net, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will defer the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved. F-11 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Company’s revenue is primarily derived from leasing activities which is accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 - Leases. The Company’s other revenue is also comprised of tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, and operating. Reimbursements from real estate taxes and certain other expenses are also accounted for under ASC 842. The Company elected to utilize the practical expedient provided by Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2018-11 related to the separation of lease and non-lease components. The predominant component of revenue is the lease component, and as a result, revenues related to leases are reported on one line in the presentation within the consolidated statements of operations.Investment in Real Estate Joint Ventures and Partnerships To determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships, management begins with evaluating whether or not there are any variable interests. Management then determines whether an entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and, if so, determines which party is the primary beneficiary by analyzing whether we have both the power to direct the entity’s significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits. Significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this analysis include the design of the entity structure, the nature of the entity’s operations, future cash flow projections, the entity’s financing and capital structure, and contractual relationships and terms. We consolidate a VIE when we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary.Primary risks associated with our involvement with our VIEs include the potential funding of the entities’ debt obligations or making additional contributions to fund the entities’ operations or capital activities.Partially owned, non-variable interest real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we have a controlling financial interest are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. In determining if we have a controlling financial interest, we consider factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions, kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. Partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we do not have a controlling financial interest, but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Management continually analyzes and assesses reconsideration events, including changes in the factors mentioned above, to determine if the consolidation or equity method treatment remains appropriate. The Company's investments in Hartman SPE, LLC and Silver Star are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards for equity securities. Management has determined that the Hartman SPE, LLC and Silver Star investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are recorded at cost minus impairment. The Company's investment in the office building located at 3100 Weslayan Street, Houston, Texas is accounted for as an equity method investment. Distributions received from equity method investments are classified based on cumulative earnings. Amounts up to the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings since acquisition reduce the investment’s carrying value. Distributions exceeding cumulative earnings are treated as a return of capital, reducing the investment balance without income recognition. The Company evaluates investments for impairment when events indicate a potential other-than-temporary decline in value.The Company evaluates its investment in real estate joint ventures and partnerships for impairment each reporting period. The Company evaluates various factors, including operating results of the investee, ability and intent to hold the investment and views on current market and economic conditions, when determining if there is a decline in the investment value. The Company will record an impairment charge if it's determined that a decline in the estimated fair value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary. The ultimate realization is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. There is no certainty that impairments will not occur in the future if market conditions decline or if management’s plans for these investments change. See Note 4. Management recognized an impairment charge of $502,000 related to the Company’s investment in unconsolidated entities as of December 31, 2022F-12 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSReal EstateAllocation of Purchase Price of Acquired AssetsAcquisitions of integrated assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. Third-party transaction costs, including acquisition fees paid to our advisor, associated with asset acquisitions will be capitalized while internal acquisition costs will continue to be expensed as incurred. Upon acquisition, the purchase price of properties is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, any assumed debt and asset retirement obligations, if any, based on their relative fair values. Acquisition costs, including acquisition fees paid to our advisor, are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Land and building and improvement fair values are derived based upon the Company’s estimate of fair value after giving effect to estimated replacement cost less depreciation or estimates of the relative fair value of these assets using discounted cash flow analyses or similar methods. The fair values of above-market and below-market in-place lease values, including below-market renewal options for which renewal has been determined to be reasonably assured, are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (2) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases and below-market renewal options, which is generally obtained from independent appraisals, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The above-market and below-market lease and renewal option values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment of rental revenues over the remaining expected terms of the respective leases.The fair values of in-place leases include direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease, and tenant relationships. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated based on independent appraisals and management’s consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs are included in intangible lease assets and are amortized to expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs is calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. Customer relationships are valued based on expected renewal of a lease or the likelihood of obtaining a particular tenant for other locations. These intangibles are included in real estate assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.The Company determines the fair value of any assumed debt by calculating the net present value of the scheduled mortgage payments using interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities that the Company believes it could obtain at the date of acquisition.  Any difference between the fair value and stated value of the assumed debt is recorded as a discount or premium and amortized over the remaining life of the loan as interest expense. In allocating the purchase price of each of the Company’s acquired or purchased properties, the Company makes assumptions and uses various estimates, including, but not limited to, the estimated useful lives of the assets, the cost of replacing certain assets and discount rates used to determine present values. The Company uses Level 3 inputs to estimate fair value of the acquired properties. Many of these estimates are obtained from independent third-party appraisals; however, the Company is responsible for the source and use of these estimates. These estimates require judgment and are subject to being imprecise; accordingly, if different estimates and assumptions were derived, the valuation of the various categories of the Company’s properties or related intangibles could in turn result in a difference in the depreciation or amortization expense recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These variances could be material to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.Depreciation and amortizationDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of five years to 39 years for buildings and improvements. Tenant improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. In-place leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the weighted average years' remaining calculated on terms of all of the leases in-place when acquired.F-13 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSImpairmentThe Company reviews its real estate and related intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. The Company determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), including the estimated residual value of the property, with the carrying cost of the property. If impairment is indicated, then a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management has concluded that there were no indicators of impairment in the carrying value of the Company’s real estate, and related intangible assets. Projections of expected future cash flows require management to estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, property operating expenses, discount rates, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property and the number of years the property is held for investment. The use of inaccurate assumptions in the future cash flow analysis would result in an incorrect assessment of the property’s future cash flow and fair value and could result in the overstatement of the carrying value of the Company’s real estate and related intangible assets and net income.Fair Value MeasurementFair value measures are classified into a three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1:Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.Level 2:Directly or indirectly observable inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets.Level 3:Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require a reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following valuation techniques:Market Approach:Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.Cost Approach:Amount required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).Income Approach:Techniques used to convert future amounts to a single amount based on market expectations (including present-value, option-pricing, and excess-earnings models).The Company’s estimates of fair value were determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The Company used non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurements to assess potential impairment of its investments in unconsolidated entities and conducted a comprehensive analysis to estimate the fair value of such investments as of December 31, 2022. This analysis was performed using appropriate valuation methodologies, observable market inputs where available, and unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions and judgment. In evaluating potential impairment, the Company developed assumptions based on a variety of relevant qualitative and quantitative factors, including the financial condition and operating performance of the unconsolidated entities. Key indicators assessed included changes in financial results, occupancy levels, net operating income, estimated equity value, and net asset value per share during the relevant periods. The Company also considered macroeconomic and market-specific factors, including conditions in the broader real estate industry and, more specifically, within the commercial office market in Texas, which may have adversely affected the valuation of certain investments.The assumptions used in the fair value assessments reflected management’s best estimates regarding future cash flows, capitalization rates, discount rates, and market comparable. Accrued Rent and Accounts ReceivableAccrued rent and accounts receivable include base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight-line basis. An allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rent and accounts receivable is determined based upon customer creditworthiness, historical bad debt levels, and current economic trends.F-14 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPrepaid expenses and other assetsPrepaid expenses and other assets include prepaid insurance, subscription receivable and miscellaneous other assets and prepayments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $188,000 and $303,000, respectively, in prepaid expense and other assets.Acquisition DepositsAcquisition deposits represent funds in escrow or advanced to a seller of a property which the Company plans to acquire. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had acquisition deposits of $0 and $125,000, respectively, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets. Organization and Offering Costs As of December 31, 2022, total organization and offering costs incurred for the offering amounted to $8,496,000. The total organizational and offering costs incurred by the Company (including selling commissions, dealer manager fees and all other underwriting compensation) did not exceed 15% of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock sold in the initial public offering.Organization costs, when recorded by the Company, are expensed as incurred, and offering costs, which include selling commissions, dealer manager fees and all other underwriting compensation, are deferred and charged to stockholders’ equity as such amounts are reimbursed or paid by the Advisor, the dealer manager or their affiliates from gross offering proceeds.For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, such costs totaled $181,000 and $162,000, respectively.Income Taxes The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing in the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, then the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, so long as it distributes at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net loss of $1,930,000 and $2,206,000, respectively. The Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary which may generate future taxable income which may be offset by a net loss carry forward. The Company considers that any deferred tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset which may be recorded in light of the net loss carry forward would be properly offset by an equal valuation allowance. Accordingly, no deferred tax benefit or deferred tax asset has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.The Company is required to recognize in its consolidated financial statements the financial effects of a tax position only if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax position will not be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Management has reviewed the Company’s tax positions and is of the opinion that material positions taken by the Company would more likely than not be sustained upon examination. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized a liability related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.Loss Per Share The computations of loss per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities. The Company’s potentially dilutive securities include special limited partnership interests - see Note 11. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no common shares issuable in connection with these potentially dilutive securities. These potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computations of diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.F-15 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSConcentration of RiskThe Company maintains cash accounts in one U.S. financial institution. The terms of the Company's deposits are on demand to minimize risk. The balances of the Company's depository accounts may exceed the federally insured limits. No losses have been incurred in connection with these deposits.The geographic concentration of the Company’s real estate assets makes it susceptible to adverse economic developments in the State of Texas. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, increased competition or any other changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders.Major tenants are defined as those tenants who individually comprise more than 10% of the Company’s total rental revenues. No tenant represents over 10% of the Company's total rental revenue in 2022. One tenant of the Spectrum Building represents 18% of total annualized rental revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Going Concern EvaluationPursuant to ASC 205-40, “Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern,” management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued (or when applicable, one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued).
Management has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, due to uncertainty about the ability to meet certain loan covenant requirements of the Master Credit Facility with East West Bank. However, management believes that the Company will be able to effectively manage day-to-day operations and meet these loan covenant requirements to remain in compliance, which is expected to mitigate the covenant issue within one year of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. See Note 14 (Subsequent Events) for additional information regarding loan extensions.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The updated guidance requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This is different from the current guidance as this will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. Generally, the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective method of adoption. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after January 2023, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity can elect to apply the amendments as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to that date that the financial statements are available to be issued. In October 2022, the FASB approved a two-year extension of the temporary accounting relief provided under ASU 2020-04 to December 31, 2024.For the period from January 1, 2020 (the earliest date the Company may elect to apply ASU 2020-04) through December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any contract modifications impacting current reference rates. The Company's SASB Loan and derivative instrument use LIBOR as the current reference rate. The optional expedients for hedging relationships described in ASU 2020-04 are not expected to have an impact to the Company.F-16 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires the disclosure of incremental segment information, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to net income. The title and position of the CODM must also be disclosed, along with how the CODM uses the reported measures to assess segment performance and to allocate resources. Entities with a single reportable segment (such as the Company) will be required to provide the disclosures required by Topic 280, as amended. The standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024 and the required disclosures for the Company will begin with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. With the Company having only one segment, the adoption, effective January 1, 2024, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amended guidance focuses on providing more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Pursuant to this ASU, the footnotes to the Company's consolidated financial statements may include incremental disclosures related to income taxes. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, therefore, compliance with this ASU will be required beginning with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this ASU for its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025, and is continuing to research the impact of this amended guidance, however, does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2024 and January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 and ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ("Update 2024-03"), which requires companies to disclose additional information for certain relevant expense categories in the Statements of Operations and within the notes to the financial statements. Update 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted and can be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or retrospectively to prior periods which are presented in the financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Note 3 — Real EstateThe Company’s real estate assets, net as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following, in thousands: December 31, 20222021Land$16,816 $16,816 Buildings and improvements63,724 59,719 In-place lease value intangible7,477 7,477  88,017 84,012 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization(20,682)(16,369)Total real estate assets, net$67,335 $67,643 Depreciation expense (excluding in place intangibles) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3,566,000 and $3,825,000, respectively.         The Company identifies and records the value of acquired lease intangibles at the property acquisition date. Such intangibles include the value of acquired in-place leases and above and below-market leases. Acquired lease intangibles are amortized over the leases' remaining terms. With respect to all properties owned by the Company, the Company considers all of the in-place leases to be market rate leases.F-17 HARTMAN vREIT XXI, INC.

Amortization expense for the years ended the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $747,000 and $1,695,000 respectively.There were no acquisition fees recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Acquisition fees are capitalized and added to the real estate assets, at cost, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Asset management fees incurred were $553,000 and $553,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Asset management fees are captioned as such in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.The Company owns an 83% tenant in common (“TIC”) interest in an office building located at 3100 Weslayan, Houston, Texas. The property comprises approximately 78,289 rentable square feet and is commonly referred to as Weslayan. The remaining 17% TIC interest is owned by Allen Hartman. The Company is party to a loan agreement where it is jointly and severally liable with Mr. Hartman.
The Weslayan property is collateral for the loan. As of December 31, 2022, the loan had an outstanding principal balance of $3,831,000 and a current interest rate of 4.66%. The maturity date of the loan is August 6, 2024. Installments of principal and interest are payable monthly. The Company exercises significant influence as a result of the Weslayan TIC interest, but the Company does not have financial and operating control. Weslayan is accounted for as an equity method investment and presented on the consolidated balance sheets within the "Investment in tenant in common interest, net" line item. The Company recognized equity in net loss of tenant in common interest of $330,000 and $540,000 for December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, related to the Weslayan TIC interest. Note 4 — Investment in unconsolidated entitiesEffective March 1, 2019, the Company's board of directors approved the exchange of 3.42% of the Company's 5.89% ownership interest in Hartman SPE, LLC for 700,302 shares of common stock of Silver Star. The exchange reduced the Company’s ownership interest in Hartman SPE, LLC from 5.89% to 2.47%.
On April 14, 2020, the Company made a tender offer to stockholders of Hartman Income REIT, Inc. ("HIREIT") to acquire up to 500,000 shares of HIREIT common stock at a price of $4.00 per share. On May 1, 2020, the Company extended the term of the tender offer until May 13, 2020 and modified the offer to purchase up 500,000 shares of HIREIT common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. As of September 24, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of 661,940 HIREIT common shares and 80,000 Hartman Income REIT Operating Partnership ("HIROP") OP units for consideration of $3,709,703.The HIREIT common shares and HIROP OP units acquired were converted into 497,926 Silver Star common shares and 60,178 Hartman XX Operating Partnership OP units in connection with the merger of those entities. The Company's investment in Hartman SPE, LLC and Silver Star do not have a readily determinable fair value and are recorded at cost minus impairment. The aggregate carrying amount for the investments is $11,232,000 and $11,734,000
as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company did not receive any distributions from Hartman SPE, LLC for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company recognized dividend income of
