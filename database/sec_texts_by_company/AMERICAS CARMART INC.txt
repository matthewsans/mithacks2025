PART III – NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Forms 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR,
N-CSR, or the transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
As part of the year-end reporting process and the preparation of the Registrant’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025 (the “Annual Report”), management identified the need
to enhance disclosures related to loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, in accordance with ASC 310-10-50-42
through 50-44.
Specifically, the Registrant is enhancing its disclosures regarding loan
modifications to customers. The Registrant is in the process of completing its analysis of these accounts and based on its preliminary
assessment, believes additional disclosures around the loan modifications associated with these customers are required.
As a result of the time required to complete these enhanced disclosures,
the Registrant is unable to file its Annual Report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense. The Registrant
expects to file the Annual Report within the fifteen-day filing extension provided by Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

been filed? If the answer is no, identify report(s).  [X] Yes
[  ] No
(3)Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will
be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report or portion thereof?
[X] Yes [  ] No
If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively and quantitatively,
and, if appropriate, state the reasons why a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.
As previously disclosed in the Registrant’s June 12, 2025 press release
announcing fourth quarter and full-year results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, the Registrant expects to report the following
in its consolidated statements of operations for the full year, which will be included in the upcoming Annual Report:
•Total
revenues decreased by $3.0 million, or (0.2)%.
•Total
costs and expenses decreased by $65.9 million, or (4.6)%.
•Net
income improved by $49.3 million, shifting from a net loss of $31.4 million, or diluted loss per share of $4.92, in fiscal
year 2024 to a net profit of $17.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.33, in fiscal year 2025.
These figures reflect management’s current estimates and are subject to change. Final
results will be included in the Annual Report once filed.
