Annuity contracts represent contractual agreements in which payments are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or lump sum amount at a later date. Annuity contracts are valued at fair value using the net present value of future cash flows.
In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.
Activity primarily represents amounts written-off during the year, along with other adjustments (primarily foreign currency translation adjustments).
Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. These securities include U.S. equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges inside the U.S. and international equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges outside the U.S.
Mutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Mutual funds held by the Company’s funded benefit plans are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities Exchange Commission. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value (“NAV”) and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held by the Company’s funded benefit plans are deemed to be actively traded.

PART I
Item 1. Business
Twin Disc, Incorporated (“Twin Disc”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918. Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off‑highway power transmission equipment. The Company has manufacturing locations in the United States, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In addition to these countries, it has distribution locations in Singapore, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Products offered include: marine transmissions, azimuth drives, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches, controls systems, and braking systems. The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government, military and industrial markets. The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network. The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
On February 14, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Kobelt Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“Kobelt”).  Based in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, Kobelt is a manufacturer of controls, propulsion, steering, and braking systems to the marine, oil and gas, and industrial markets. The provisional fair value estimates of Kobelt's deferred income taxes, property, plant and equipment, net and intangible assets, net, are pending final review by the Company, and Kobelt is included in the Company's manufacturing segment.
On May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Katsa Oy (“Katsa”). Based in Finland, Katsa is a European manufacturer of custom-designed, high-quality power transmission components and gearboxes for industrial and marine end-markets for a broad range of end market applications. Katsa also provides a wide range of after-sales services, including spare part deliveries, reverse engineering, modeling, and gearbox refurbishment. Katsa is included in the Company’s manufacturing segment.
Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
The Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable. The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in Europe, occur mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers. The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers. The primary competitive factors for the Company’s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability. The Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 35% and 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. No individual customer accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2025 and 2024.
Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $150.5 million, including the impact of the acquisition of Kobelt, at June 30, 2025 compared to $133.7 million, including the impact of the acquisition of Katsa, at June 30, 2024. Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six‑month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog. However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate. Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in total backlog.

Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered low due to the relatively low investment within individual countries that have currency movement restrictions. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products. Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2.7 million and $2.6. million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Total engineering and development costs were $12.2 million and $9.8 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not anticipated to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company.
The number of persons employed by the Company at June 30, 2025 was 980, including the impact of the acquisition of Kobelt, and at June 30, 2024 was 910, including the impact of the acquisition of Katsa, respectively. The Company believes that its continued success is a direct result of its talent. As such, the Company strives to be an employer of choice in every community in which it operates. It does this by fostering a fair, respectful, inclusive and safe work environment and culture shaped with its core values of customer focus, integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation.
A summary of financial data by segment, geographic area, and classes of products that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales revenues for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 appears in Note K, Business Segments and Foreign Operations, to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s website address is www.twindisc.com. The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor’s own internet access charges) through its website the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business involves various risk factors. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company’s business.
5
As a global Company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and a significant movement between the U.S. dollar and the euro exchange rate, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability.
Although the Company’s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies. The Company’s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and financial condition.
The Company could be materially adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have business operations.  Operating during a global pandemic could expose the Company to a number of material risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers’ products, suspensions in the operations of our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels, our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, access to capital and potential increases to the cost of capital, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms and potential further impairment of long-lived assets; all of which, in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Certain of the Company’s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices. In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets. The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil. Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company’s profitability. The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company’s profitability.
Many of the Company’s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or unpredictable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s overall financial performance. Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government, military and industrial markets. The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors. Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.
In the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products.
With the continued advancement of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years. The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its needs. However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company’s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company. If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.
6
The Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability. In addition, developments in tariff regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have resulted in uncertainty regarding international trade policies and future commodity prices, contributing to an increased risk of higher commodity costs that could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s profitability is dependent, in part, on commodity costs. To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions. However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing or cost reductions, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s future profitability.
The Company anticipates that additional tariffs or trade restrictions resulting from “trade wars” could result in an increase in its cost of sales and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to pass any of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from additional tariffs to its customers. Given that it procures many of the raw materials that it uses to create its products directly or indirectly from outside of the U.S., the imposition of tariffs and other potential changes in U.S. trade policy could increase the cost or limit the availability of such raw materials, which could hurt its competitive position and adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company sells a significant proportion of its products to customers outside of the U.S. Retaliatory actions by other countries could result in increases in the price of its products, which could limit demand for such products, hurt its global competitive position and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
If the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company’s business would be adversely affected. Although no individual customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company’s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected. Although the Company’s accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of its largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable and future operating results.
The termination of relationships with the Company’s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products. The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company’s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected. Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and financial condition.
A significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability.
As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company’s products are some of its competitive advantages. While the Company prides itself on implementing procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.
The Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 73% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2025. The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Canada, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, China, Japan, and Singapore. The Company’s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within countries that favor local companies over US companies, including government-supported efforts to promote local competitors;
7
currency exchange rate fluctuations;
global trade issues and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including tariffs, trade sanctions, and international trade disputes, and the ability to obtain required import and export licenses;
differing legal systems and standards of trade which may not honor our intellectual property rights, and which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;
multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including varying labor laws and tax regulations;
reliance on various information systems and information technology to conduct our business, making us vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breaches due to employee error, misuse, or other causes, that could result in business disruptions, loss of or damage to our intellectual property and confidential information (and that of our customers and other business partners), reputational harm, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or other adverse consequences;
regional or global economic downturns or recessions, varying foreign government support, unstable political environments, and other changes in foreign economic conditions;
difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, managing distributors and representatives, and repatriating cash and dividends;
longer sales cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and
different customs and ways of doing business.
To date, our operations have not been materially adversely affected by global conflicts including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, further escalation of this or other conflicts could result in, among other negative consequences, a disruption to the global economy and supply chain leading to a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture and timely deliver our products. Any such shortages could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and, in turn, our ability to satisfy our customer demand. These challenges, together with other challenges associated with operating an international business, may adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue and our other operating results.
A material disruption at one of the Company’s largest manufacturing facilities could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand. If operations at one of the Company’s largest facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions, labor force disruptions or other reasons, the Company’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition. The Company maintains property damage insurance, which it believes is adequate to reconstruct its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers. If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.
The ability to service the requirements of debt depends on the ability to generate cash and/or refinance its indebtedness as it becomes due, and depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. The Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement on February 14, 2025. The Company’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness, including those under the credit agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate expenses depends on the Company’s future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond its control. The Company cannot be certain that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund its other operating requirements. Significant delays in its planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future revenue prospects.
8
Any failure to meet debt obligations and financial covenants, and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  The Company’s revolving credit facility expiring April 2027 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment.  Under this agreement, the Company’s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient asset levels at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings.  The Company is also required to comply with a total funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum tangible net worth.  If the Company does not meet these financial covenants as specified under the agreement, the Company may require forbearance or relief from its financial covenant violations from its senior lender or be required to arrange alternative financing. Failure to obtain relief from financial covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note H, Debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2026 to meet the required financial covenants under the agreements. However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods.
While the Company has obtained forgiveness of its Paycheck Protection Program Loan (“PPP loan”), it remains subject to audit under the program’s rules and any resulting adverse audit findings of non-compliance can result in the repayment of a portion or all of the PPP loan.  On April 17, 2020, the Company received proceeds of $8.2 million from a loan under the PPP of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which it has used to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments.  The Company accounted for the full proceeds as a loan.  It obtained formal forgiveness of the full amount of the loan on June 16, 2021, and accounted for the forgiveness as income from extinguishment of loan in its statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021.
While the loan has been formally forgiven, under the terms of the PPP loan, the Company remains subject to an audit by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) for a period of six years after forgiveness.  The audit is intended to confirm the Company’s eligibility for the PPP loan and the appropriateness of the PPP loan forgiveness. The Company is aware of the requirements of the PPP loan and believes it is within the eligibility threshold and has used the loan proceeds in accordance with PPP loan forgiveness requirements. It has retained all necessary documentation in support of its eligibility, including gross receipts calculations, supporting payroll expenses and related information. However, no assurance is provided that the Company will satisfy fully all the requirements of an audit. If despite the Company’s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP loan, it may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties, which could result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company’s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition of Katsa and Kobelt in its forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate. The integration of Katsa and Kobelt into the Company’s business processes is ongoing. While the integration is currently proceeding as planned, the Company has made certain longer term assumptions relating to the forecast level of synergies and associated costs of the acquisition of Katsa and Kobelt that may be inaccurate based on the information that was available to the Company or as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, higher than expected integration costs, unknown liabilities and global economic and business conditions that may adversely affect the combined Company following the completion of the acquisition. The combination of the businesses will require significant management attention, and the Company may incur significant additional integration costs because of integration difficulties and other challenges.

As a result of the acquisition of Katsa and Kobelt, the Company carries a significant amount of intangible assets, but it may never fully realize the full value of these assets. The full accounting for the Kobelt acquisition, including the purchase price allocation, is pending final review by the Company. The Company recorded intangible assets, including customer relationships, technology know-how, trade name, and computer software for both Katsa and Kobelt.
Amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment may result from, among other things, (i) a decrease in its expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in its common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) heightened competition; (viii) strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions; or (ix) a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of. In the event that it determines that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, it might have to recognize a non-cash impairment of identifiable intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
The Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the allowance totaled $24.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively.
Taxing authority challenges and changes to tax laws may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves. The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company’s effective tax rate.
Future changes in tax law in the United States or the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company’s information system and expose the Company to liabilities, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its internal and external data centers, cloud services and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company’s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company’s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure, and that of its partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise the Company’s networks and/or that of its partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory fines or penalties, including, among others, under the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation, disrupt the Company’s operations, damage its reputation and/or cause a loss of confidence in the Company’s products and services, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
The Company’s Audit Committee is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification and management, and planning for, risks from cybersecurity threats.
The Company has developed and implemented processes to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of its overall enterprise risk management system. Its cybersecurity processes include security monitoring and threat hunting through a third-party managed vendor and mandatory, company-wide employee training. The processes also extend to oversight and identification of risks associated with vendors and customers if their computer systems interface with the Company’s information systems. Upon detection of a potentially material cybersecurity incident, the Company initiates its cyber incident procedure to investigate, contain, and remediate the incident.
The Company has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents, and the expenses incurred from any security incidents have been immaterial. However, as discussed under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report, cybersecurity threats pose multiple and potentially material risks to the Company, including potentially to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company relies extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risk. As cybersecurity threats become more frequent, sophisticated, and coordinated, it is reasonably likely that the Company may expend greater resources to continue to modify and enhance protective measures against such security risks.
Item 2. Properties
The Company leases a facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A., which serves as its corporate headquarters.

Note on Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains statements (including but not limited to certain statements in Items 1, 3, and 7) that are forward-looking as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.  Forward-looking statements include the Company’s description of plans and objectives for future operations and assumptions behind those plans. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” estimates,” and “expects,” or similar anticipatory expressions, usually identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on management’s current expectations that are based on assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may vary because of variations between these assumptions and actual performance.  In addition, goals established by the Company should not be viewed as guarantees or promises of future performance. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in achieving its goals.
The Company intends that such forward-looking statements qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition to the assumptions and information referred to specifically in the forward-looking statements, other factors, including, but not limited to those factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors, could cause actual results to be materially different from what is presented in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. The Company assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information, or otherwise.
Fiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024
Net Sales
Net sales for fiscal 2025 increased 15.5%, or $45.6 million, to $340.7 million from $295.1 million in fiscal 2024. The Company’s acquisition of Katsa at the beginning of fiscal 2025 contributed $39.1 million of incremental revenue, while the acquisition of Kobelt in the Company’s third fiscal quarter contributed $4.9 million of incremental revenue. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the Company’s revenue was relatively flat with the prior year, as strong growth in the Veth product was offset by weaker oil and gas transmission shipments into China and some weakness in the European industrial and commercial marine markets. Currency translation had a favorable impact on fiscal 2025 sales compared to the prior year totaling $1.5 million, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.
Excluding the impact of the Katsa and Kobelt acquisitions, sales for our manufacturing segment decreased 2.5%, or $7.5 million, versus the same period last year. The largest improvement was seen at the Company’s Veth propulsion operation in the Netherlands, which experienced a 12.3% increase in sales compared to fiscal 2024. The primary driver for this increase was growing demand through market and geographic penetration for the Company’s innovative propulsion solutions around the globe, along with improving supply chain and operational performance. The Company’s domestic manufacturing operation experienced a 1.8% decrease in sales in fiscal 2025, driven by some softening demand for oil and gas transmissions in China. The Company’s Italian manufacturing operations reported a 29.7% decrease in sales from fiscal 2024, primarily due to the sale of the BCS business during fiscal 2024. The Company’s Belgian manufacturing operation saw an 18.4% decrease in sales from fiscal 2024 with softer demand in the European marine markets. The Company’s Swiss manufacturing operation, which supplies customized propellers for the global mega yacht and patrol boat markets, experienced a 3.9% increase in sales compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to a strengthening European propulsion market.
14
Sales for our distribution segment were down 8.6%, or $12.4 million, compared to fiscal 2024. The Company’s Asian distribution operations in Singapore, China and Japan experienced a 6.7% decrease in sales on softening demand for energy related products in China. The Company’s North American distribution operation saw a 26.9% decrease on weaker domestic demand for marine products from the European operations. The Company’s European distribution operation was essentially flat with the prior year. The Company’s distribution operation in Australia, which provides boat accessories, propulsion and marine transmission systems for the pleasure craft market, saw a slight decrease in revenue (0.7%) on consistent demand for pleasure craft products in the region.
Net sales for the Company’s marine transmission and propulsion systems were up 17.1% in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase reflects generally strong market conditions, continued global growth of the Veth product, the addition of the Katsa and Kobelt product lines and a general easing of supply chain constraints during the fiscal year. In the off-highway transmission market, the year-over-year increase of 2.1% can be attributed primarily to the historically high demand for the Company’s ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) transmissions. The increase experienced in the Company’s industrial products of 61.8% was a function of stronger demand in the North American construction and recycling markets, along with the addition of the Katsa and Kobelt product lines.
Geographically, sales to the U.S. and Canada improved 10% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, representing 27% of consolidated sales for fiscal 2025 compared to 28% in fiscal 2024. The increase is primarily due to the addition of Kobelt, improving Veth demand in the region and recovering industrial sales. Sales into the Asia Pacific market decreased 20% compared to fiscal 2024 and represented approximately 22% of sales in fiscal 2025, compared to 32% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in fiscal 2025 reflects softening demand for the Company’s oil and gas transmissions in the Chinese market. Sales into the European market improved approximately 40% from fiscal 2024 levels while accounting for 41% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025 compared to 33% of net sales in fiscal 2024. The addition of Katsa revenue in fiscal 2025, along with strong demand for the Company’s Veth propulsion products, drove much of the fiscal 2025 growth. See Note K, Business Segments and Foreign Operations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company’s business segments and foreign operations.
Gross Profit
In fiscal 2025, gross profit improved $9.4 million, or 11.3%, to $92.7 million on a sales increase of $45.6 million. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points in fiscal 2025 to 27.2%, compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2024.
There were a number of factors that impacted the Company’s overall gross profit rate in fiscal 2025. Gross profit for the year was primarily impacted by improved volumes (approximately $12.9 million). This was offset by a less favorable product mix (approximately $3.1 million), primarily related to weaker demand for oil and gas related products. The company also recorded purchase accounting amortization in cost of goods sold totaling $0.9 million in fiscal 2025. The remaining increase ($0.5 million) is the result of price realization, cost reduction efforts and improved productivity at our operating facilities.
Marketing, Engineering and Administrative (ME&A) Expenses
Marketing, engineering, and administrative (ME&A) expenses of $82.4 million were up $10.8 million, or 15.1%, in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of sales, ME&A expenses decreased to 24.2% of sales versus 24.3% of sales in fiscal 2024. The increase in ME&A spending in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the addition of the Katsa and Kobelt operations ($8.6 million). The remaining increase was driven by an inflationary increase to salaries and benefits ($1.5 million), stock compensation expense ($0.7 million), professional fees ($1.3 million), and a legal settlement ($0.4 million). These increases were partially offset by reductions to the global bonus expense ($1.0 million), bad debt expense ($0.3 million) and other cost savings ($0.4 million).
15
Restructuring of Operations
During the course of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 the Company incurred $0.4 million and $0.2 million in restructuring charges, respectively. These charges relate to a continued restructuring program at the Company’s Belgian operation to focus resources on core manufacturing process, while allowing for savings on the outsourcing of non-core processes.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $2.6 million for fiscal 2025 was $1.2 million higher than fiscal 2024 due to an increased average balance following the two completed acquisitions.
Other Income, Net
In fiscal 2025, other expense, net, of $5.5 million increased by $10.8 million from the prior fiscal year other income, net, of $5.3 million. This change is primarily due to an increase in currency translation losses ($5.2 million), an increase in defined benefit pension amortization ($2.0 million) and the prior year impact of a bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of Katsa ($3.7 million).
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is 190.4% compared to 26.8% for fiscal 2024.
The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize all the domestic deferred tax assets, therefore, the company recorded in fiscal year 2025 and 2024, the valuation allowance of $24.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively.
Order Rates
As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months (six-month backlog) was $150.5 million or approximately 13% higher than the six-month backlog of $133.7 million as of June 30, 2024. The increased backlog is primarily attributable to continued strength in order rates throughout the fiscal year, led by continued growth in demand for the Veth product, along with the addition of Kobelt backlog ($2.8 million).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Fiscal Years 2025 and 2024
The net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 totaled $24.0 million, a decrease of $9.7 million from the prior fiscal year cash provided by operating activities of $33.7 million. The reduction in operating cash flow from the prior year was primarily due to an increase in inventory in fiscal 2025. This increase was driven by some shipping delays at the end of fiscal 2025, along with operational increases to support a growing backlog. The Company expects to drive inventory reductions through fiscal 2026. The unfavorable movement in inventory was partially offset by favorable movements in trade payables and accrued liabilities.
16
The net cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2025 primarily represents the acquisition of Kobelt ($17.2 million) and the acquisition of property, plant and equipment ($15.2 million). The capital spending amount reflects a significant increase from the prior year, driven by the additional capital needs of Katsa and the timing of machine tool deliveries.
The net cash used by financing activities relates primarily to payments for dividends ($2.6 million), payments on finance lease obligations ($1.1 million) and payments on stock compensation withholding taxes ($1.3 million). These uses were partially offset by incremental borrowings of $4.0 million. During fiscal 2025, the Company did not purchase any shares as part of its Board-authorized stock repurchase program. The Company has 315,000 shares remaining under its authorized stock repurchase plan.
Future Liquidity and Capital Resources
On February 14, 2025, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of Montreal (the “Bank”) that refinances and replaces the credit agreement dated as of June 29, 2018, as amended, between the Company and BMO Harris Bank, N.A. (the “Prior Credit Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Bank made a Term Loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, consisting of an assignment of a term loan under the Prior Credit Agreement from BMO to the Bank with a remaining principal of $8.5 million and an additional advance of $6.5 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan is April 1, 2027, and the Company is required to make principal installments on the Term Loan of at least $0.75 million per quarter. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is restricted in making dividend payments beyond $5 million in any fiscal year.
In addition, the Company may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate and subject to a Borrowing Base, $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”). The Borrowing Base is the sum of (a) 85% of outstanding unpaid Eligible Receivables and (b) the lesser of $40.0 million for each fiscal month ending on or prior to August 31, 2025 (reduced to $35.0 million for each fiscal month ending on or prior to August 31, 2026, and further reduced to $32.5 million for each fiscal month ending thereafter) and 60% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending on or prior to August 31, 2025 (reduced to 55% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending on or prior to February 28, 2026, and 50% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending thereafter). The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from the Bank, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by the Bank, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may not pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of $5.0 million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement runs through April 1, 2027.
The Company used the increased borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to help finance its acquisition of Kobelt. Kobelt is included as a Borrower under the Credit Agreement, and may borrow directly under the Credit Agreement up to the lesser of the Revolving Credit Commitment or $25.0 million. For purposes of determining the Borrowing Base under the Credit Agreement, Eligible Receivables and Eligible Inventory of Kobelt are included.
Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), the euro interbank offered rate (the “EURIBO Rate”), or the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (the “CORRA”). Loans under the Credit Agreement are designated as either as “SOFR Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin; “Eurodollar Loans,” which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin; “Term CORRA Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term CORRA plus an Applicable Margin; “Daily Compounded CORRA Loans,” which accrue interest at a Daily Compounded CORRA plus an Applicable Margin; or Canadian Prime Rate Loans,” which accrue interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margins are between 2% and 3.5% for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 2.125% and 3.625% for Term Loans; and .15% and .3% for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio).
17
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. In determining whether the Company is in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company’s EBITDA will include transaction expenses of up to $0.6 million for each of the Company’s Kobelt Acquisition and the Company’s prior Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa and Kobelt as permitted by the Bank. The Company’s Tangible Net Worth may not be less than $100.0 million plus 50% of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2024.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement secured by substantially all of the Company’s and Kobelt’s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged 65% of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment to the Bank of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank in connection with an April 22, 2016 credit agreement between the Company and the Bank, and further amended such agreements pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Specifically, the Company amended and agreed to the assignment to the Bank of a Security Agreement, IP Security Agreement, Pledge Agreement, Perfection Certificate, and Assignment as to Liens and Encumbrances. The Company also amended and assigned to the Bank a Negative Pledge Agreement, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Kobelt. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also required to be guaranteed by each U.S. subsidiary of the Company.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Bank may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (1) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; (2) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (3) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if the Bank determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company’s bankruptcy, the Bank may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company.
The Company remains in compliance with its liquidity and other covenants under the Credit Agreement.
Management believes that available cash, the Credit Agreement, the unsecured lines of credit, cash generated from future operations, and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the Company's cash and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
The Company’s balance sheet remains strong, there are no material off-balance-sheet arrangements, and it continues to have sufficient liquidity for its near-term needs. The Company had approximately $32.1 million of available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2025. The Company expects to continue to generate enough cash from operations, as well as its credit facilities, to meet its operating and investing needs. As of June 30, 2025, the Company also had cash of $16.1 million, primarily at its overseas operations. These funds, with some restrictions and tax implications, are available for repatriation as deemed necessary by the Company. In fiscal 2026, the Company expects to contribute $0.7 million to its defined benefit pension plans, the minimum contribution required.
18
Net working capital increased $1.0 million, or 0.8%, during fiscal 2025 and the current ratio (calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities) decreased to 2.0 at June 30, 2025 compared to 2.2 for June 30, 2024. The increase in net working capital was primarily the result of an increase to inventory ($21.5 million) and trade receivables ($6.7 million). These increases were partially offset by increases in trade payables ($6.2 million) and accrued liabilities ($18.2 million).
The Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $17 million - $19 million in fiscal 2026. These anticipated expenditures reflect the Company’s plans to invest in modern equipment to drive growth, efficiencies, quality improvements and cost reductions.
Management believes that available cash, the credit facility, cash generated from future operations, and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the Company’s capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
Contractual Obligations
The Company's significant contractual obligations as of June 30, 2025 are discussed in Note I “Lease Obligations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There are no material undisclosed guarantees.  As of June 30, 2025, the Company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90 days.  The Company also has long-term obligations related to its postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note N “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Postretirement medical claims are paid by the Company as they are submitted, and they are anticipated to be $0.5 million in fiscal 2026 based on actuarial estimates; however, these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the Company is self-insured. In fiscal 2026, the Company expects to contribute $0.7 million to its defined benefit pension plans, the minimum contribution required.
Other Matters
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of this Annual Report requires management’s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. However, the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating its reported financial results are the following:
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company’s measurement date utilizing discount rates as the significant assumption in determining the obligation as of that date. The approach used to determine the discount rates is based on the Willis Towers Watson BOND:Link model at June 30, 2025 as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans. This yield curve is made up of Corporate Bonds rated AA or better.
19
Measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year-end measurements of assets and obligations. The Company reviews its discount rates on an annual basis and makes modifications when appropriate. The effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods. Based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the discount rates used are reasonable; however, changes in the discount rates could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Taxes and Valuation Allowances
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, several factors are considered (e.g., prior earnings history, carry-back and carry-forward periods, etc.) but the most significant factors are expected future earnings that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset and tax strategies. Based on the above criteria the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as relates to its domestic operations. A full domestic valuation allowance of $24.0 million has been recognized at June 30, 2025. The recognition of a valuation allowance does not affect the availability of the tax credits as the Company realizes earnings.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1.
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company,
2.
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and
3.
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures included in such controls may deteriorate.
The Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework (2013 edition) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon such evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.
For purposes of evaluating the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, the Company did not include the internal controls of Kobelt, which the Company acquired on February 14, 2025, and which are included in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity, for the year then ended.
RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, as stated in their report which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Twin Disc, Incorporated
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Twin Disc, Incorporated’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated September 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Kobelt Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“Kobelt”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We have also excluded Kobelt from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Kobelt is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets, net sales and income from operations represent approximately 6.0%, 1.4% and 0.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
25
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Twin Disc, Incorporated
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedule (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated September 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
27
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
As described in Note O to the consolidated financial statements the Company’s gross deferred tax asset and valuation allowance was approximately $31,582,000 and $23,964,000, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets in future periods, the available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, history of book losses, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations, are considered.
We identified management’s determination of the value of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter as there is significant judgment required by management to conclude that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the auditing of these elements involved complex and subjective auditor judgment, including the need to involve personnel with specialized skill and knowledge.
Our audit procedures to evaluate management’s determination that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize all of the deferred tax assets included the following, among others:
●
We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over income taxes, specifically, those controls over the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets.
●
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates in regard to the ability to generate future taxable income and utilize the deferred tax assets by evaluating: (i) the forecast of future taxable income, including testing of management’s forecasts against the Company’s historical performance, and (ii) testing management’s assessment of the timing of future reversals of temporary differences.
●
We utilized personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in income taxes and accounting for income taxes under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 to assist in the evaluation of management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence and their conclusion that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets.

TWIN DISC, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS AND PER SHARE DATA)
A.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations‑‑Twin Disc, Incorporated (“Twin Disc”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918. Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off‑highway power transmission equipment. The Company has manufacturing locations in the United States, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In addition to these countries, it has distribution locations in Singapore, China, Australia and Japan. Products offered include: marine transmissions, azimuth drives, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches, controls systems, and braking systems. The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government, military, and industrial markets. The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network.
On
February 14, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Kobelt Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“Kobelt”). Based in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, Kobelt is a manufacturer of controls, propulsion, steering, and braking systems to the marine, oil and gas, and industrial markets. The provisional fair value estimates of Kobelt's deferred income taxes, property, plant and equipment, net and intangible assets, net, are pending final review by the Company, and Kobelt is included in the Company's manufacturing segment.
On
May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Katsa Oy (“Katsa”). Based in Finland, Katsa is an European manufacturer of custom-designed, high-quality power transmission components and gearboxes for industrial and marine end-markets for a broad range of end market applications. Katsa also provides a wide range of after-sales services, including spare part deliveries, reverse engineering, modeling, and gearbox refurbishment. Katsa is included in the Company’s manufacturing segment.
Basis of Presentations‑‑The consolidated financial statements and information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States of America. The Company’s fiscal year end is
June 30.
Consolidation Principles‑‑The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Twin Disc, Incorporated and its wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Management Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
Translation of Foreign Currencies‑‑The financial statements of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities, the weighted-average exchange rate for the year for revenues and expenses, and the historical exchange rate for the year for equity. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is included in equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings. Included in other (expense) income are foreign currency transaction gain (losses) of ($4,825) and $377 in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Business Combinations‑‑ In accordance with ASC 805-10, “Business Combinations”, the Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the Company allocates the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination to the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of the tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as the liabilities assumed. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess consideration transferred is recorded as goodwill and in instances where the fair value of consideration transferred is less than the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed, such amounts are recorded as a gain on the bargain purchase.
33
Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities, or non-controlling interests made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill or the gain on the bargain purchase. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is re-measured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value and the existing book value.
Cash--The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalent. Under the Company’s cash management system, cash balances at certain banks are funded when checks are presented for payment. To the extent that checks issued, but not yet presented for payment, exceed the balance on hand at the specific bank against which they were written, the amount of those un-presented checks is included in accounts payable. The Company maintains cash in bank accounts in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe that significant credit risk exists as a result of this practice.
Accounts Receivable, net --These represent trade accounts receivable and are stated net of an allowance for credit losses of $1,548 and $1,383 at
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company records an allowance for credit losses for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified as well as provisions determined on a general basis when it is believed that some default is probable and estimable. The assessment of likelihood of customer default is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, the historical collection experience, as well as the consideration of customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, negotiated changes to the payment terms of customers, recent economic trends, and expectations regarding economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable future period. Various factors
may adversely impact its customer’s ability to access sufficient liquidity and capital to fund their operations and render the Company’s estimation of customer defaults inherently uncertain. While the Company believes current allowance for credit losses are adequate, it is possible that these factors
may cause higher levels of customer defaults and bad debt expense in future periods.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments. If measured at fair value, cash would be classified as Level 1 and all other items listed above would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note N, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. The Company’s borrowings under the revolving loan agreement, which is classified as long-term debt and consists of loans that are routinely borrowed and repaid throughout the year, approximate fair value at
June 30, 2025. The Company’s term loan borrowing, which is SOFR-based, approximates fair value at
June 30, 2025. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including any current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Inventories, net‑‑Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value (or lower of cost or market where appropriate). Cost has been determined by the last‑in, first‑out (LIFO) method for the majority of inventories located in the United States, and by the first‑in, first‑out (FIFO) or average cost methods for all other inventories. Management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage, forecasted production based on future orders, demand forecasts, and economic trends, among others, when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.
Property, Plant and Equipment, net and Depreciation‑‑Assets are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged against earnings as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated. Capital project costs are accumulated in construction-in-progress until completed, at which time the costs are transferred to the relevant asset and commence depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The lives assigned to buildings and related improvements range from 10 to 40 years, and the lives assigned to machinery and equipment range from 5 to 15 years. Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Fully depreciated assets are not removed from the accounts until physically disposed.
At
June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company owned one permanently idled facility with a book value of $3.0 million. This facility is assessed for impairment quarterly and depreciation has ceased. This facility is accounted for within property, plant and equipment.
34
Right of Use Lease Assets‑‑In accordance with ASC 842, the Company’s leases, with lease periods longer than twelve months, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. These leases primarily consist of office and warehouse facilities, as well as production and office equipment.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. The lease term begins upon lease commencement, which is when the Company takes possession of the asset, and
may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. As its lease agreements typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company primarily uses an incremental borrowing rate based upon the information available at lease commencement. In determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers its current borrowing rate, the lease period, and the economic environments where the lease activity is concentrated.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets--The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. When triggering events are identified, the Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists for property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses; however, other methods
may be used to determine the fair value, including third party valuations when necessary.
Intangible Assets, net-- Intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, technology know-how, and tradenames, all of which are definite-lived. They were initially valued at fair value at acquisition, and are amortized over their respective useful lives on the basis of straight line or accelerated, as appropriate.
Goodwill-- The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually as of the first day of the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying value of goodwill
may not be recoverable.
A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators
may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill impairment charges are recorded using a simplified one-step approach. The fair value of a reporting unit, as defined, is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses which is driven by projected growth rates, and which applies an appropriate market-participant discount rate; the fair value determined is also compared to the value obtained using a market approach from guideline public company multiples. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, that difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
The Company conducted its annual assessment for goodwill impairment as of
June 30, 2025 using updated inputs, including appropriate risk-based, country and company specific weighted average discount rates for the Company’s reporting unit with goodwill. The Company completed its impairment testing as of
June 30, 2025 and concluded there were no impairments.
Changes in circumstances, existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of goodwill, could result in an impairment charge in the future. The Company will continue to monitor all significant estimates and impairment indicators, and will perform interim impairment reviews, as necessary.
Derivative Financial Instruments--The Company has written policies and procedures that place all financial instruments under the direction of the Company’s corporate treasury department and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes. The use of financial instruments for trading purposes is prohibited. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain financial risks. The Company enters into forward contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to reduce the exposure to variability in interest rates on floating debt borrowings. The Company designates certain financial instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The Company designates certain financial instruments as net investment hedges to reduce the exposure in its foreign currency denominated net investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries. See Note S, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information.
35
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans-- The Company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement health care coverage. Plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the Company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement and mortality tables, and health care cost trend rates as of that date.
Income Taxes--The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions as new information becomes available. Tax benefits are recognized to the extent a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority.
Segment Reporting--Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. As of
June 30, 2025, the Company identified two operating segments. Refer to "Note K. Business Segments and Foreign Operations" for further information.
Revenue Recognition--Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a five-step model consisting of the following:
1.
Identify the contract with a customer; The Company’s customers consist of distributors and direct end-users. With regard to distributors, the Company generally has written distribution agreements which describe the terms of the distribution arrangement, such as the product range, the sales territory, product pricing, sales support, payment and returns policy, etc. Customer contracts are generally in the form of acknowledged purchase orders. Services to be rendered, as part of the delivery of those products, are also generally specified. Such services include installation reviews and technical commissioning.
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract; The Company’s performance obligations primarily consist of product delivery and certain service obligations such as technical commissioning, repair services, installation reviews, and shift development.
3.
Determine the transaction price; The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, including the expected value of variable consideration. Variable consideration is immaterial.
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; The Company determined that the most relevant allocation method for its service obligations is to apply the expected cost plus appropriate margin. This is the Company’s practice of billing for repairs, overhaul, and other product service related time incurred by its technicians.
5.
Recognize revenue; Revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied which is typically when the Company transfers control of a good or service to a customer, which can occur over time or at a point in time. For technical commissioning, repairs, installation review, and shift development services, revenue is recognized upon completion of the service. The customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in determining whether a contract exists with the customer. If collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a contract is not probable, consideration received is not recognized as revenue unless the consideration is nonrefundable and the Company no longer has an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or collectability becomes probable.
Goods sold to third party distributors are subject to an annual return policy, for which a provision is made at the time of shipment based upon historical experience. Goods sold under bill and hold arrangements are recorded as revenue when control has been transferred to the customer and when the reason for the arrangement is substantive, when the product is identified as the customer’s asset, when the product is ready for delivery to the customer, and when the Company cannot use the product or redirect the product to another customer. While significant customer deposits are collected at certain locations, the Company’s payment terms are generally short-term in nature and therefore do not include a significant financing component.
36
At
June 30, the Company reported the following contract assets and liabilities, which are presented within trade accounts receivable, net and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Deferred revenue represents billings in excess of cost based on milestone billings in the contract.
Contract Assets    Contract Liabilities
Costs in Excess of Billings, Net    Trade Accounts Receivable, Net      Total Contract Assets    Customer Deposits    Deferred Revenue    Total Contract Liabilities
2023  $-  $54,760  $54,760  $22,937  $-  $22,937
2024   5,216   52,207   57,423   26,540   2,025   28,565
2025  $6,988  $58,941  $65,929  $13,538  $29,664  $43,202
Our contracts are generally short term in nature, and therefore, the amount included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year was recognized as revenue in the reporting period.
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs--The Company records revenue from shipping and handling costs in net sales. The cost associated with shipping and handling of products is reflected in cost of goods sold.
Recently Issued Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards-- In
November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures” (“ASU 2024-03”) to expand expense disclosures by requiring disaggregated disclosure of certain income statement expense line items, including those that contain purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and amortization. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2026, or the Company’s fiscal 2028, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In
December 2023, the FASB issued guidance ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which includes requirements that an entity disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that are greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income rate. The standard also requires that entities disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) and income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statement disclosures.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards-- In
November 2023, the FASB issued guidance ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment and contain other disclosure requirements. The Company adopted the new annual disclosures as required for fiscal 2025 and will adopt the interim disclosures as required beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2026.

Based in Surrey, British Columbia, Kobelt is a Canadian manufacturer of controls, propulsion, steering, and braking systems to the marine, oil and gas, and industrial markets. This acquisition was pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) entered into by Twin Disc Canada Holdings Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with the prior owners, on
February 14, 2025. Immediately following the acquisition, Kobelt and Twin Disc Canada Holdings Ltd amalgamated to continue a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, retaining the Kobelt name.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $17,236 in cash at closing, which included a base payment plus adjustments for net cash, working capital, and earnout. The Company paid an additional $516 for the net working capital adjustment. The amount is still subject to a final determination of the earnout calculation. The transaction is considered a taxable stock acquisition.
The Company, in part, financed the payment of the cash consideration through borrowings of $6,500 under a new credit agreement entered into on
February 14, 2025 with Bank of Montreal (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement is further discussed in Note K, Debt.
Kobelt brings a complementary range of products that enhance and diversify the Company's portfolio, reinforcing Twin Disc’s position as a global leader in power transmission solutions. Kobelt's in-house foundry and expertise in bronze die casting, precision machining, assembly and testing ensure complete quality control, which aligns perfectly with the Company's commitment to engineering excellence.
With over 60 years of experience designing and manufacturing high-quality products, Kobelt is a well-suited addition to the Twin Disc family. This acquisition opens new opportunities for growth and partnerships, leveraging the Company's global sales and service teams to drive even greater success.
Since the acquisition date, the Company included in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income net sales and earnings (loss) for Kobelt of $4,870 and ($164), respectively.

Fair Value Estimate of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
The Company is continuing its review of the fair value estimate of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period, which will conclude as soon as the necessary information regarding the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is obtained, or otherwise not available. This measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. At the effective date of the acquisition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be measured at fair value. The fair value estimates are pending completion of some elements, including the finalization of an independent appraisal and final review by the Company. Accordingly, until the fair values are final, there could be material adjustments to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including changes to depreciation and amortization expense related to the valuation of property and equipment and intangible assets acquired and their respective useful lives, among other adjustments.
Upon the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the excess of the purchase price over such fair values is allocated to goodwill.
The final determination of the purchase price, fair values and resulting goodwill
may differ significantly from what is reflected in these consolidated financial statements.

Katsa OY
On
May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Katsa. Based in Finland, Katsa is a European manufacturer of custom-designed, high-quality power transmission components and gearboxes for industrial and marine end-markets for a broad range of end market applications. Katsa also provides a wide range of after-sales services, including spare part deliveries, reverse engineering, modeling, and gearbox refurbishment. As a well-established business with a solid reputation for quality in addition to its strong in-house manufacturing and engineering capabilities, this acquisition is an excellent opportunity to expand Twin Disc’s global presence, leveraging Kata’s longstanding relationships with leading European OEMs to introduce the Company’s portfolio into new, growing markets. This acquisition was pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) entered into by TD Finland Holding Oy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with Timo Salli and Jouko Salli, the prior owners, on
March 5, 2024.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $25,522 in cash at closing, which included a base payment plus adjustments for net cash and working capital, and transactions costs of $377. This amount was subject to a final determination of working capital adjustments.

The acquisition of Katsa met the criteria for a business combination to be accounted for using the acquisition method under ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), with the Company identified as the legal and the accounting acquirer. The Company recognized approximately $745 of acquisition-related costs which were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
June 30, 2024.
The following table details the allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of Katsa.
Cash purchase price  $25,145

41
The fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of $29,608 exceeded the purchase price of the business, and additional expected working capital adjustment, of $25,884. As a result, the Company reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that the valuation procedures and resulting measurements were appropriate. Accordingly, the acquisition has been accounted for as a bargain purchase and as a result, the Company recognized a gain of $3,724, net of income tax of $2,435. associated with the acquisition. The amount is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Pro forma results of operation for this acquisition have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
Fair Value Estimate of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
The Company is continuing its review of the fair value estimate of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period, which will conclude as soon as the necessary information regarding the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is obtained, or otherwise not available. This measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. At the effective date of the acquisition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be measured at fair value. The provisional fair value estimates of the property, plant and equipment, net, the intangible assets, net, and deferred income taxes are pending final review by the Company. Accordingly, until the fair values are final, there could be material adjustments to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including changes to depreciation and amortization expense related to the valuation of property and equipment and intangible assets acquired and their respective useful lives, among other adjustments.
Upon the final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the excess of the purchase price over such fair values is allocated to goodwill or the excess of such fair values over the purchase price is allocated to bargain purchase gain. The final determination of the purchase price, fair values and resulting bargain purchase gain
may differ significantly from what is reflected in these consolidated financial statements.
The following summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, including the preliminary estimates of the property, plant and equipment, net, the intangible assets, net, and deferred income taxes:

C. INVENTORIES, NET
The major classes of inventories at
June 30 were as follows:
2025    2024
Finished parts  $67,037  $60,166
Work in process   27,229   23,096
Raw materials   57,685   47,222
$151,951  $130,484
43
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell most of its boat management system product line located at one of its subsidiaries in Italy. The sale amount was below cost and resulted in the Company recognizing an inventory write-down of $2.1 million. The Company also evaluated its other boat management system inventory, not associated with the sale. The evaluation resulted in the Company recognizing an additional inventory write-down of $1.6 million for inventory located in the U.S. These write-downs were partially offset by certain liabilities transferred to the buyer at the time of the sale. The sale was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.
The second quarter of fiscal year 2025 includes the impact of a non-cash inventory write-down of $1,579. This write-down reflects the results of a product rationalization exercise of the Company’s industrial product line following the acquisition of Katsa.
Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represent approximately 24% and 31% of total inventories at
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The approximate current cost of the LIFO inventories exceeded the LIFO cost by $31,877 and $30,680 at
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Inventories in the United States were reduced during fiscal 2025 and 2024, resulting in a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers that were carried at a lower cost prevailing from a prior year, as compared with current costs in the current year (“LIFO decrement”). A LIFO decrement results in the erosion of layers created in earlier years, and, therefore, a LIFO layer is not created for years that have decrements. For the years ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024, the effects of LIFO decrements decreased cost of goods sold by $2,112 and $1,553, respectively.
The Company had reserves for inventory obsolescence of $16,016 and $12,693 at
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

G. WARRANTY
The Company warrants all assembled products, parts (except component products or parts on which written warranties are issued by the respective manufacturers thereof and are furnished to the original customer, as to which the Company makes no warranty and assumes no liability) and service against defective materials or workmanship. Such warranty generally extends from periods ranging from 12 months to 24 months. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers. However, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, the number of units affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation. The warranty reserve is established based on the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. When evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs, management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage, historical claim rates and costs of repair, knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends. While the Company believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires. The following is a listing of the activity in the warranty reserve during the years ended
June 30:
2025    2024
Reserve balance, July 1  $4,220  $3,476
Current period expense and adjustments   5,499   5,850

Credit Agreement Debt:
Current Credit Agreement
On
February 14, 2025, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of Montreal (the “Bank”) that refinances and replaces the credit agreement dated as of
June 29, 2018, as amended, between the Company and BMO Harris Bank, N.A. (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). There were no significant financing costs associated with the credit agreement.
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Bank made a Term Loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, consisting of an assignment of a term loan under the Prior Credit Agreement from BMO to the Bank with a remaining principal of $8.5 million and an additional advance of $6.5 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan is
April 1, 2027, and the Company is required to make principal installments on the Term Loan of at least $0.75 million per quarter. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is restricted in making dividend payments beyond $5 million in any fiscal year.
46
In addition, the Company
may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate and subject to a Borrowing Base, $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Commitment”). The Borrowing Base is the sum of (a) 85% of outstanding unpaid Eligible Receivables and (b) the lesser of $40.0 million for each fiscal month ending on or prior to
August 31, 2025 (reduced to $35.0 million for each fiscal month ending on or prior to
August 31, 2026, and further reduced to $32.5 million for each fiscal month ending thereafter) and 60% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending on or prior to
August 31, 2025 (reduced to 55% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending on or prior to
February 28, 2026, and 50% of Eligible Inventory for each fiscal month ending thereafter). The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from the Bank, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by the Bank, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company
may not pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of $5.0 million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement runs through
April 1, 2027.
The Company used the increased borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to help finance its acquisition of Kobelt. Kobelt is included as a Borrower under the Credit Agreement, and
may borrow directly under the Credit Agreement up to the lesser of the Revolving Credit Commitment or $25.0 million. For purposes of determining the Borrowing Base under the Credit Agreement, Eligible Receivables and Eligible Inventory of Kobelt are included.
Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), the euro interbank offered rate (the “EURIBO Rate”), or the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate (the “CORRA”). Loans under the Credit Agreement are designated as either as “SOFR Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin; “Eurodollar Loans,” which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin; “Term CORRA Loans,” which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term CORRA plus an Applicable Margin; “Daily Compounded CORRA Loans,” which accrue interest at a Daily Compounded CORRA plus an Applicable Margin; or Canadian Prime Rate Loans,” which accrue interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margins are between 2% and 3.5% for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 2.125% and 3.625% for Term Loans; and .15% and .3% for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio).
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio
may not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. In determining whether the Company is in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company’s EBITDA will include transaction expenses of up to $0.6 million for each of the Company’s Kobelt Acquisition and the Company’s prior Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa and Kobelt as permitted by the Bank. The Company’s Tangible Net Worth
may not be less than $100.0 million plus 50% of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after
June 30, 2024.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement secured by substantially all of the Company’s and Kobelt’s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged 65% of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment to the Bank of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank in connection with an
April 22, 2016 credit agreement between the Company and the Bank, and further amended such agreements pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Specifically, the Company amended and agreed to the assignment to the Bank of a Security Agreement, IP Security Agreement, Pledge Agreement, Perfection Certificate, and Assignment as to Liens and Encumbrances. The Company also amended and assigned to the Bank a Negative Pledge Agreement, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Kobelt. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also required to be guaranteed by each U.S. subsidiary of the Company.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Bank
may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (1) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; (2) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (3) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if the Bank determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company’s bankruptcy, the Bank
may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company.

Prior Credit Agreement
The Prior Credit Agreement, which was replaced by the Credit Agreement on
February 14, 2025, provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans under a 2016 credit agreement between the Company and Bank of Montreal (as amended, the “2016 Credit Agreement”) into a term loan (the “Prior Term Loan”) and revolving credit loans (each a “Prior Revolving Loan” and, collectively, the “Prior Revolving Loans,” and, together with the Prior Term Loan, the “Prior Loans”). Pursuant to the Prior Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Prior Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount not to exceed $35.0 million and the Company could, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Prior Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate, $50.0 million (the “Prior Revolving Credit Commitment”), subject to a Borrowing Base based on Eligible Inventory and Eligible Receivables. Subsequent amendments to the Prior Credit Agreement reduced the Prior Term Loan to $20.0 million, extended the maturity date of the Prior Term Loan to
April 1, 2027, and required the Company to make principal installment payments on the Prior Term Loan of $0.5 million per quarter. Subsequent amendments to the Prior Credit Agreement (prior to the Tenth Amendment to the Prior Credit Agreement discussed below) incrementally decreased BMO’s Prior Revolving Credit Commitment to $40.0 million. The Prior Credit Agreement also allowed the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Prior Revolving Loans. Under the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company was prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock in excess of $5.0 million in any fiscal year.
Under the Prior Credit Agreement as amended, interest rates were based on either the SOFR or the EURIBO Rate. Prior Loans were designated either as “SOFR Loans,” which accrued interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin, or “Eurodollar Loans,” which accrued interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin. Amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit that were not timely reimbursed to the Bank bore interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Company also paid a commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment equal to an Applicable Margin. Immediately prior to
February 14, 2025, the Applicable Margins were between 2% and 3.5% for Prior Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 2.125% and 3.625% for Prior Term Loans; and 0.15% and 0.3% for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio).
The Prior Credit Agreement, as amended, required the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio could not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio could not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. In determining whether the Company was in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company’s EBITDA included transaction expenses of up to $0.6 million for the Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa as permitted by the Bank. The Company’s Tangible Net Worth could not be less than $100.0 million plus 50% of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after
June 30, 2024.
Borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement were secured by substantially all of the Company’s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company had also pledged 100% of its equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and 65% of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company had also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Veth Propulsion. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank of Montreal in connection with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company also amended and assigned to BMO a Negative Pledge Agreement that it has previously entered into with Bank of Montreal, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement.
The Company had also entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with the Bank, reflecting the Bank’s security interest in deposit accounts the Company maintains with the Bank. The Bank could not provide a notice of exclusive control of a deposit account (thereby obtaining exclusive control of the account) prior to the occurrence or existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or otherwise upon the occurrence or existence of an event or condition that would, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Prior Credit Agreement.
48
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, BMO could take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (1) terminate its remaining obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement; (2) declare all amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (3) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company’s bankruptcy, BMO could take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company.
On
April 1, 2024, the Company had entered into Amendment No. 10 to Prior Credit Agreement (the “Tenth Amendment”) that amended and extended the Prior Credit Agreement. The Tenth Amendment increased the Prior Revolving Credit Commitment from $40.0 million to $45.0 million, and also increased the Borrowing Base for Prior Revolving Loans from the sum of (a) 85% of outstanding unpaid Eligible Receivable and (b) the lesser of $30.0 million and 50% of Eligible Inventory to the sum of (a) 85% of outstanding unpaid Eligible Receivables and (b) the lesser of $35.0 million (reduced to $32.5 million beginning with the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year) and 60% of Eligible Inventory (reduced to 55% of Eligible Inventory beginning with the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, and 50% of Eligible Inventory beginning with the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year).
The Company used the increased borrowing capacity under the Tenth Amendment to help finance its acquisition of Katsa by TD Finland Holding Oy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Tenth Amendment specifically permitted the Company to use Prior Revolving Loans for the Katsa acquisition. In addition, in determining whether the Company is in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company’s EBITDA included transaction expenses of up to $0.6 million for the Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa as permitted by the Bank.
The Tenth Amendment also extended the Prior Credit Agreement through
April 1, 2027 and extended the maturity date of the Prior Term Loan and the Prior Term Loan Commitment Date to
April 1, 2027.
The Tenth Amendment also increased the Applicable Margins under the Prior Credit Agreement for purposes of determining interest rates on Prior Revolving Loans, Letters of Credit, Prior Term Loans, and the Prior Unused Revolving Credit Commitment. Prior to the Tenth Amendment, the Applicable Margins were between 1.25% and 2.75% for Prior Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 1.375% and 2.875% for Prior Term Loans; and .10% and .15% for the Prior Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio). Under the Tenth Amendment, the Applicable Margins were between 2% and 3.5% for Prior Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 2.125% and 3.625% for Prior Term Loans; and .15% and .3% for the Prior Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company’s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio).
During fiscal year 2025, the average interest rate was 7.07% on the Term Loan, and 5.39% on the Revolving Loans.
As of
June 30, 2025, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the terms of the Credit Agreement was approximately $50,597 and the Company had approximately $32,079 of available borrowings.
The Company’s borrowings described above approximates fair value at
June 30, 2025 and
June 30, 2024. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company is party to an interest rate swap arrangement with Bank of Montreal, with an initial amount of $20,000 and a maturity date of
March 4, 2026 to hedge the Term Loan. As of
June 30, 2025, the notional amount was $7,500. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This swap is included in the disclosures in Note S, Derivative Financial Instruments.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company designated its euro denominated Revolving Loan as a net investment hedge to mitigate the risk of variability in its euro denominated net investments in wholly-owned foreign companies. Effective upon the designation, all changes in fair value of the euro Revolving Loan are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those foreign investments. This net investment hedge is included in the disclosures in Note S, Derivative Financial Instruments.

L. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company adopted the Twin Disc, Incorporated Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s shareholders. The Omnibus Plan amended and restated the Twin Disc, Incorporated 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2021 LTI Plan”), and effectively replaced the Twin Disc, Incorporated 2020 Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2020 Directors' Plan”). Benefits under the Omnibus Plan
may be granted, awarded or paid in any one or a combination of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, cash-settled restricted stock units, performance stock awards, performance stock unit awards, performance unit awards, and dividend equivalent awards. The Omnibus Plan is designed to benefit key employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as non-employee directors of the Company.
56
There is reserved for issuance under the Plan an aggregate of 1,636,550 shares of the Company’s common stock, which consists of the previously-approved 715,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 LTI Plan prior to its amendment and restatement to become the Omnibus Plan; 521,550 shares of common stock that remained available for issuance under the 2020 Directors' Plan; and 400,000 newly authorized shares of common stock. Shares issued under the Omnibus Plan
may be authorized and unissued shares or shares reacquired by the Company in the open market or a combination of both. The aggregate amount is subject to proportionate adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits and similar changes.
Shares available for future awards as of
June 30 were as follows (assuming that outstanding performance awards are issued at the target level of performance):

N. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees hired prior to
October 1, 2003, and certain foreign employees. Domestic plan benefits are based on years of service, and, for salaried employees, on average compensation for benefits earned prior to
January 1, 1997, and on a cash balance plan for benefits earned from
January 1, 1997 through
July 31, 2009, at which time the Company froze future accruals under domestic defined benefit pension plans.
58
In addition, the Company has unfunded, non-qualified retirement plans for certain management employees and Directors. In the case of management employees, benefits are based on an annual credit to a bookkeeping account, intended to restore the benefits that would have been earned under the qualified plans, but for the earnings limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. In the case of Directors, benefits are based on years of service on the Board. All benefits vest upon retirement from the Company.
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides other postretirement benefits, including healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain domestic retirees. All employees retiring after
December 31, 1992, and electing to continue healthcare coverage through the Company's group plan, are required to pay 100% of the premium cost.
The measurement date for the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was

Plan Assets
The Company’s Benefits Committee (“Committee”), a non-board management committee, oversees investment matters related to the Company’s funded benefit plans. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. The overall objective of the Committee’s investment strategy is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension plans. The Committee has established an Investment Policy Statement which provides written documentation of the Company’s expectations regarding its investment programs for the pension plans, establishes objectives and guidelines for the investment of the plan assets consistent with the Company’s financial and benefit-related goals, and outlines criteria and procedures for the ongoing evaluation of the investment program. The Company employs a total return on investment approach whereby a mix of investments among several asset classes are used to maximize long-term return of plan assets while avoiding excessive risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, and annual liability measurements.
The Company’s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at
June 30, 2025 and 2024 by asset category were as follows:
Target    June 30
Asset Category   Allocation    2025    2024
Equity securities   15%  15%  19%
Debt securities   75%  78%  71%
Real estate   10%  7%  10%
100%  100%  100%
Due to market conditions and other factors, actual asset allocation
may vary from the target allocation outlined above. The U.S. pension plans held 98,211 shares of Company stock with a fair market value of $867 (1.7% of total plan assets) at
June 30, 2025 and 98,211 shares with a fair market value of $1,157 (1.8% of total plan assets) at
June 30, 2024.
The U.S. plans have a long-term return assumption of 6.25%. This rate was derived based upon historical experience and forward-looking return expectations for major asset class categories.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy:
Level I
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments
Level II
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, or
Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or
Other inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data
Level III
Use of one or more significant unobservable inputs

(a) Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. These securities include U.S. equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges inside the U.S. and international equity securities invested in companies that are traded on exchanges outside the U.S.
(b) Mutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Mutual funds held by the Company’s funded benefit plans are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities Exchange Commission. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value (“NAV”) and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held by the Company’s funded benefit plans are deemed to be actively traded.
(c) Annuity contracts represent contractual agreements in which payments are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or lump sum amount at a later date. Annuity contracts are valued at fair value using the net present value of future cash flows.
(d) In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.

At
June 30, 2025 the Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $0 and $31,031 for federal and state income tax purposes which will expire at various dates from fiscal year 2026 – 2044.  During the year, the Company filed amended tax returns, which resulted in adjustments to certain tax attribute balances, including federal net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The Company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11,718 and $1,276, respectively, which will expire at various dates from fiscal 2026 – 2044. The majority of the Company’s foreign tax credit carryforwards, which make up $9,639 of the $11,718, are scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2026.
The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The Company has evaluated the likelihood of whether the net deferred tax assets would be realized and concluded that it is more likely than not that all of deferred tax assets would not be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize all the domestic deferred tax assets, therefore, a valuation allowance in the amount of $23,964 and $24,035 have been recorded for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The Company has not provided additional U.S. income taxes on cumulative earnings of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. The Company reaffirms its position that the earnings of those subsidiaries remain permanently invested and has no plans to repatriate funds from any permanently reinvested subsidiaries to the U.S. for the foreseeable future. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $30,302 and $20,977 at
June 30, 2025 and
June 30, 2024, respectively. Such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation. The Company’s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits.
Annually, the Company files income tax returns in various taxing jurisdictions inside and outside the United States. In general, the tax years that remain subject to examination are 2020 through 2025 for our major operations in Belgium, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore and Australia. The tax years open to examination in the U.S. are for years subsequent to fiscal 2020.
The Company has approximately $644 and $766 of unrecognized tax benefits as of
June 30, 2025 and
June 30, 2024 respectively, which, if recognized would impact the effective tax rate. No material changes are expected to the reserve during the next 12 months. The Company’s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
66
Below is a reconciliation of beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of
June 30:
2025    2024
Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year  $766  $774
Additions based on tax positions related to the prior year   95   -
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year   38   8
Reductions based on tax positions related to the prior year   (28)  (16)
Subtractions due to statues closing   (227)  -
Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year  $644  $766
Substantially all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as of
June 30, 2025, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As of
June 30, 2025 and 2024, the amounts accrued for interest and penalties totaled $6 and $68, respectively, and are not included in the reconciliation above.
On
July 4, 2025, the President signed H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” into law. The legislation includes several changes to federal tax law that generally allow for more favorable deductibility of certain business expenses beginning in calendar year 2025, including the restoration of immediate expensing of domestic R&D expenditures, reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation, and more favorable rules for determining the limitation on business interest expense.
The Act also includes certain changes to the US taxation of foreign activity, including changes to foreign tax credits, GILTI, FDII, and BEAT. These changes are generally effective for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2025.
These changes were not reflected in the income tax provision for the period ended
June 30, 2025, as enactment occurred after the balance sheet date.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact on future periods. This tax act
may have a material impact on the company’s ability to realize it’s deferred tax assets and the need to maintain the valuation allowance.
The impacts of this law change is expected to be reflected in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the period in which the tax act was enacted into law.
P. CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in litigation of which the ultimate outcome and liability to the Company, if any, are not presently determinable. Management believes that final disposition of such litigation will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, either individually or in the aggregate.
Q. RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS
Restructuring expenses
The Company has implemented various restructuring programs in response to unfavorable macroeconomic trends in certain of the Company’s markets since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. These programs primarily involved the reduction of workforce in several of the Company’s manufacturing locations, under a combination of voluntary and involuntary programs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company undertook a series of steps to accelerate its focus on its core competencies, improve its fixed cost structure, and monetize some of its under-utilized assets.
The Company continued its restructuring plans with regard to its Belgian operations during fiscal year 2025 and 2024. A voluntary program was implemented to reduce the workforce. The action was taken to allow the Belgian operation to focus resources on core manufacturing processes, while allowing for savings on the outsourcing of non-core processes.
Total restructuring charges relating to streamlining operations totaled $369 and $300 in fiscal year
June 30, 2025 and
June 30, 2024, respectively.
67
The following is a roll-forward of restructuring activity:
Accrued restructuring liability, June 30, 2024  $-
Additions   408
Payments, adjustments and write-offs during the year   (369)
Accrued restructuring liability, June 30, 2025  $39
R. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company calculates basic earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, while the calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes all potential common shares if their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect.
The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:
2025    2024
Basic:
Net (loss) income  $(1,599) $11,246
Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest   (295)  (258)
Net (loss) income attributable to Twin Disc, Incorporated   (1,894)  10,988
Weighted average shares outstanding - basic   13,856   13,683
Basic Income Per Share:
Net (loss) income per share - basic  $(0.14) $0.80
Diluted:
Net (loss) income  $(1,599) $11,246
Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest   (295)  (258)
Net (loss) income attributable to Twin Disc, Incorporated   (1,894)  10,988
Weighted average shares outstanding - basic   13,856   13,683
Effect of dilutive stock awards   -   194
Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted   13,856   13,877
Diluted Income Per Share:
Net (loss) income per share - diluted  $(0.14) $0.79
The following potential common shares were excluded from diluted EPS for the year-ended
June 30, 2025 as the Company reported a net loss: 404.3 related to the Company’s unvested PSAs, 10.5related to the Company’s unvested PSAUs, 121.0 related to the Company’s unvested RS awards, and 55.0 related to the Company’s unvested RSUs.
S. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company reports all derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes.
68
As a global organization, the Company faces exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company’s practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if it determines the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring.
Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
The primary purpose of the Company’s cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with interest payments on the Company’s SOFR-based indebtedness. The Company records gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that these hedges are effective and until the Company recognizes the underlying transactions in net earnings, at which time these gains and losses are recognized in interest expense on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. These contracts generally have original maturities of greater than twelve months.
Net unrealized after-tax gains related to cash flow hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were ($284) and ($504) for the years ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The unrealized amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period.
The Company estimates that ($75) of net unrealized loss related to cash flow hedging activities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its investment in net assets in foreign countries. As discussed in Note H, Debt, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company designated its euro denominated Revolving Loan, with a notional amount of €13,500, as a net investment hedge to mitigate the risk of variability in its euro denominated net investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. All changes in fair value of the euro revolver were then reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those foreign investments. Net unrealized after-tax gains related to net investment hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were $129 and ($1,502) for the years ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
The Company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. These contracts are highly effective in hedging the cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period. The primary currency to which the Company was exposed in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was the euro. At
June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no significant forward exchange contracts outstanding.
Other Derivative Instruments
The Company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure. Likewise, the Company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
69
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
The Company’s interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates, and various interest rate curves, and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third-party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments (Level 2).
Counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts have at least an investment grade rating. Credit ratings on some of the Company’s counterparties
may change during the term of the financial instruments. The Company closely monitors its counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to its financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.
As discussed in Note H, Debt, the Company's euro denominated Revolving Loan approximates fair value at
June 30, 2025 and
June 30, 2024. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, it would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of derivative instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets at
June 30 were as follows:
Balance Sheet Location   2025    2024
Derivatives designated as hedges:
Interest rate swaps
Other current assets  $75  $218
