The listed documents should be clearly described for identification purposes (e.g., annual report to security holders for fiscal year ended December 24, 1980). None.    Explanatory Note Subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, management of Freedom Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), in consultation with our independent registered public accounting firm, determined that the previously issued audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 contained material misstatements and should no longer be relied upon. The Company identified errors related primarily to the overstatement of accounts receivable and fixed assets, as well as the premature recognition of revenue and the incorrect accounting for certain acquisition-related transactions. As a result, the Company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The restatement adjustments reflect corrections to:  ·Accounts receivable balances, which were previously overstated by approximately $8.9 million as of September 30, 2024. ·Fixed assets, which were previously understated due to the misclassification of acquisition costs and capitalized expenditures. ·Account payables, which were previously overstated due to misclassification of capitalized expenditures. ·Reported revenues for the year ended September 30, 2024, which have been adjusted to reflect proper revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606. ·Additional paid-in capital, non-controlling interest, and other equity accounts related to merger and acquisition activity.  These corrections impacted the Company’s balance sheet, income statement, and statement of stockholders’ equity for the affected periods. The following table summarizes selected financial line item changes for the year ended September 30, 2024: Line Item As Previously Reported  As Restated  Change Revenues $1,272,800  $52,400  $(1,220,400)Cost of Sales $(1,005,341) $(20,877) $984,464 Net Loss $(20,426) $(256,362) $(235,936)Accounts Receivable $9,201,764  $300,708  $(8,901,056)Fixed Assets, net $141,806  $7,822,463  $7,680,657 Total Assets $30,270,399  $29,049,999  $(1,220,400)Account Payable $7,132768  $6,148,304  $(984,464) Significant reclassification and corrections were made to align the Company's reporting with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).  2 Freedom Holdings, Inc. ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-KFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 TABLE OF CONTENTS    Page Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 4      PART I         Item 1.Business 5 Item 1A.Risk Factors 8 Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments 13 Item 1C.Cybersecurity 13 Item 2.Properties 13 Item 3.Legal Proceedings 13 Item 4.Mine Safety Disclosures NA 13      PART II         Item 5.Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 14 Item 6.Reserved 14 Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 14 Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 18 Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 19 Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 19 Item 9A.Controls and Procedures 19 Item 9B.Other Information 20 Item 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections 20      PART III         Item 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance 21 Item 11.Executive Compensation 22 Item 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 23 Item 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 24 Item 14.Principal Accountant Fees and Services 24      PART IV         Item 15.Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule 25      Signatures 26   3Table of Contents Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. This annual report on Form 10-K of Freedom Holdings, Inc. (“FHLD”) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements which, by definition involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the Sections; Description of Business, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements. Where in any forward-looking statements, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings. You should not rely on forward-looking statements in this annual report. This annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “future,” “intends,” and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by Freedom Holdings, Inc.  4Table of Contents PART I Item 1. Business.  (a)Business Development FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INC A/K/A Freedom Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) was incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 16, 2005. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged in the following sectors. The Company was formed to participate in the mortgage industry however was forced to cease mortgage operations during the 2008 housing crisis at which time the Company acquired small oil and gas leases in SE Kansas. In 2012 the company sold the leases and began an unsuccessful effort to develop technology to recycle asphalt shingles. In 2015 (based upon the efforts and experience of our CEO) began consulting other small private and public companies assisting in the process of going public and introduction of legal and auditing firm. On January 18, 2023 the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with MedCann Industries, Inc. (“MedCann”) whereby (i) MedCann acquired a majority equity position in the Company in exchange for $50,000 consideration, and (ii) John Vivian was appointed as CEO of the Company. The Company and MedCann closed the Definitive Agreement on February 3, 2023. In June 2024, it was decided to cease all operations and activities associated with the MedCann. On September 17, 2024, the Company closed a reverse merger transaction with The Awareness Group LLC (TAG), founder of the TAG GRID and an emerging player in the alternative energy space, whereby TAG became a wholly owned and operating subsidiary of Freedom Holdings, Inc. Under terms of the agreement, the following occurred:  ·TAG shareholders obtained control of 89.5% of FHLD through a restated Series A Preferred class of stock; ·TAG CEO Pablo Diaz and the TAG management team took over as the executive team for FHLD; ·TAG assumed control of the FHLD board and appointed its existing board members to the FHLD board.  5Table of Contents Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:  ·A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;    ·Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.    ·Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and    ·No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this registration statement, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election is irrevocable and allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  (b)Business of Issuer The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Pablo Diaz, the Chief Executive Officer of the Registrant. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party. The Registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Registrant will consider the following factors:  (a)Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products.    (b)Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole.    (c)Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment.    (d)Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Registrant or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources.    (e)The cost of participation by the Registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials.    (f)The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced.    (g)The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and    (h)Other relevant factors.  6Table of Contents The names and ages of our directors and executive officers as of September 30, 2024, are set forth below.

Risk Factors. Our business has been difficult to evaluate because until our reverse merger transaction with TAG, we have had limited operating business and there has been uncertainty around what activities or businesses we will enter. As we have had a limited operating history and revenue and only minimal assets. Until the TAG transaction is fully implemented, appropriate funding and cash flow solutions are in place and the business model is fully up and running as designed, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern. We have limited assets or financial resources. Until the TAG transaction is fully implemented, appropriate funding and cash flow solutions are in place and the business model is fully up and running, we will likely sustain operating expenses without adequate corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until the TAG model is profitable. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were prepared assuming that we will continue our operations as a going concern. We do not, however, have a history of operating profitably. Consequently, our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued operations are highly dependent upon our ability to increase revenues, decrease operating costs, and complete equity and/or debt financings. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We estimate that we will not be able to continue as a going concern unless we are able to secure capital from one of these sources of financing. If we are unable to secure such financing, we may cease operations and investors in our common stock could lose all of their investment. Our auditor has been charged with violations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our auditor, Olayinka Oyebola & Co. (Chartered Accountants), and its principal, Olayinka Oyebola, (the "Auditor") have been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with aiding and abetting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The relief sought includes potential civil penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief, including an order permanently barring the Auditor from acting as an auditor or accountant for U.S. public companies or providing substantial assistance in the preparation of financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These charges and penalties, if imposed, could potentially cause the Company to find a new auditor, leading to potential restatements, delays in regulatory filings or reputational harm. Refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s press release, available at https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press- releases/2024-157.  8Table of Contents The time and cost of preparing a private company to become a public reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or acquisition with the most attractive private companies. Target companies that fail to comply with SEC reporting requirement may delay or preclude acquisition. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition. Otherwise, suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable. We may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations. Although we will be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, management believes we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), since we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. If we engage in business combinations which result in our holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. If so, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the Investment Company Act and, consequently, violation of the Investment Company Act could subject us to material adverse consequences. There is currently a limited and sporadic trading market for our common stock, and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited. Our shares of common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter market for our common stock. Further, no increased public trading market is expected to develop in the foreseeable future unless and until the Company files a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Therefore, outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under, the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws.  9Table of Contents There are issues impacting liquidity of our securities with respect to the fact that we will need to file a resale registration statement to create liquidity in our common stock. Since our shares of common stock issued prior to a business combination or reverse merger cannot currently, nor will they for a considerable period of time, be available to be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred without being registered pursuant to the Securities Act, we will likely file a resale registration statement on Form S-1, or some other available form, to register for resale such shares of common stock. We cannot control this future registration process in all respects as some matters are outside our control. Even if we are successful in causing the effectiveness of the resale registration statement, there can be no assurances that the occurrence of subsequent events may not preclude our ability to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. There may be resale restrictions imposed by rule 144(i) for one year following the company no longer being considered a shell company. Any of the foregoing items could have adverse effects on the liquidity of our shares of common stock. There are issues impacting liquidity of our securities with respect to the fact that it carries this warning on OTC Markets Warning!  This security is eligible for Unsolicited Quotes Only This stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes in this stock reflect unsolicited customer orders. Unsolicited-Only stocks have a higher risk of wider spreads, increased volatility, and price dislocations. Investors may have difficulty selling this stock. An initial review by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule15c2-11 is required for brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and if we do not pay dividends in the future then our shareholders can only benefit from their shares by selling such stock either in the public marketplace or in a private transaction. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be re-invested into us to further our business strategy. We may be subject to certain tax consequences in our business, which may increase the cost of doing business. We may not be able to structure our acquisition to result in tax-free treatment for the companies or their stockholders, which could deter third parties from entering certain business combinations with us or result in being taxed on consideration received in a transaction. Currently, a transaction may be structured to result in tax-free treatment to both companies, as prescribed by various federal and state tax provisions. We intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both us and the target entity; however, we cannot guarantee that the business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes that may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction.  10Table of Contents Our business will have no meaningful increase of revenue until the TAG transaction has been fully integrated and the operating model is successfully up and running.  Even then, there is no certainty the model will be successful and generate revenues and cash flow sufficient to fund operations. We are a development stage company and have had limited revenue from operations. We may not realize any revenue increases unless and until the TAG business model is fully and successfully implemented. We may issue additional shares for mergers or acquisitions, which may result in substantial dilution. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of a maximum of 500,000,000 shares of common stock and a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any merger or acquisition affected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm’s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interested of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially adversely affected. Our principal stockholders may engage in a transaction to cause us to repurchase their shares of common stock. To provide an interest in us to a third party, our stockholders may choose to cause us to sell our securities to one or more third parties, with the proceeds of such sale(s) being utilized by us to repurchase shares common stock held by them. As a result of such transaction(s), our management, principal stockholder(s) and Board of Directors may change. Our business focus has changed five times since inception in 2005. Since inception the Company was formed to serve the mortgage industry, however as a result of the failure of the mortgage industry the Company focus was amended to focus on the energy markets which was not successful. The Company then focused on marketing an asphalt shingle recycling technology which ultimately was also unsuccessful. Since 2017, the Company has been solely focused on the business consulting of our former CEO.  With the TAG transaction, we are re-entering the energy market, and we have a new CEO.  There can be no guarantee this change in focus and leadership will be successful.  11Table of Contents Our shares may be subject to the “penny stock” rules, which might subject you to restrictions on marketability and may not be able to sell your shares. The common stock is quoted and tradable on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets, we are subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which likely would make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities. Additional risks may exist since we have assisted a privately held business to become public through the “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our post-merger company in the future. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market for our common stock will have a generally negative effect on the price of our common stock and you may be unable to sell your common stock, or any attempted sale of such common stock may have the effect of lowering the market price. Your investment could be a partial or complete loss. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system.) Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price of liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock will ever be listed on any other securities exchange and therefore it is possible that our stockholders will not be able to liquidate their investment in our stock and we may not access to capital available to companies trading on these exchanges. We may seek the listing of our common stock on a more senior OTC exchange, or apply to list on a national exchange such as the NASDAQ or NYSE. However, we cannot assure you we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other stock exchange. After completing a business combination, until our common stock is listed on another stock exchange, we expect that our common stock would be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the “pink sheets,” where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, we would be subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such a rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination. Our authorization of blank-check preferred stock could be used to discourage a takeover transaction involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that the Company will not do so in the future.  12Table of Contents Lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is like to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 1C. Cybersecurity None. Item 2. Properties. Prior to the TAG transaction, we neither rent nor own any properties. Post transaction we now rent the TAG office space. We have no ownership interest in any real estate. Further, we currently have no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Presently, there are not any material pending legal proceedings to which the Registrant is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Registrant to be threatened or contemplated against it. Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “future,” “intends,” and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report. The management’s discussion, analysis of financial condition, and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. For example, a few of the uncertainties that could affect the accuracy of forward-looking statements include: (a)an abrupt economic change resulting in an unexpected downturn in demand for our services;(b)governmental restrictions or excessive taxes on our services;(c)economic resources to support the development of our projects;(d)expansion plans, access to potential clients, and advances in technology; and.(e)lack of working capital that could hinder acquisitions for development of our projects.  14Table of Contents Our Business Overview. FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INC A/K/A Freedom Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) was incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 16, 2005. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged in the following sectors. The Company was formed to participate in the mortgage industry however was forced to cease mortgage operations during the 2008 housing crisis at which time the Company acquired small oil and gas leases in SE Kansas. In 2012 the company sold the leases and began an unsuccessful effort to develop technology to recycle asphalt shingles. In 2015 (based upon the efforts and experience of our CEO) began consulting other small private and public companies assisting in the process of going public and introduction of legal and auditing firm. On January 18, 2023 the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with MedCann Industries, Inc. (“MedCann”) whereby (i) MedCann acquired a majority equity position in the Company in exchange for $50,000 consideration, and (ii) John Vivian was appointed as CEO of the Company. The Company and MedCann closed the Definitive Agreement on February 3, 2023. In June 2024, it was decided to cease all operations and activities associated with the MedCann. On September 17, 2024, the Company closed a reverse merger transaction with The Awareness Group LLC (TAG), founder of the TAG GRID and an emerging player in the alternative energy space, whereby TAG became a wholly owned and operating subsidiary of Freedom Holdings, Inc. Under terms of the agreement, the following occurred:  ·TAG shareholders obtained control of 89.5% of FHLD through a restated Series A Preferred class of stock; ·TAG CEO Pablo Diaz and the TAG management team took over as the executive team for FHLD; ·TAG assumed control of the FHLD board and appointed its existing board members to the FHLD board.  (a)Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:  ·A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;    ·Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.    ·Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and    ·No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this registration statement, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election is irrevocable and allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  (b)Post-Merger or Current Business of Issuer We are driving innovation in the alternative energy revolution. TAG is raising the bar with the TAG GRID, a groundbreaking national platform offering a unique suite of solar services and financing solutions for both commercial and residential projects. We plan to take care of every stage of the project, from concept to installation. This ensures a seamless experience for TAG GRID members and their customers, resulting in higher satisfaction for service providers and end users alike. Our growth is fueled by TAG Financial, which operates through two key divisions. TAG Financial Services (TFS) supports TAG GRID members by managing the front-end processes—partnering with sales organizations and EPCs while providing exclusive access to TAG and third-party lending products and innovative fintech solutions. Meanwhile, TAG Capital, our in-house fund management arm, takes it a step further by directly funding proprietary lending products and maximizing the value of our loan portfolios and investment tax credits (ITCs). While organic growth is at the core of our strategy, we’re also expanding through a proven acquisition strategy, bringing forward-thinking companies under the TAG umbrella. This approach adds new offerings, drives incremental revenue and strengthens TAG’s position as the trusted guarantor for all TAG GRID projects. Together, these efforts are propelling TAG to new heights, delivering unparalleled value to our customers, employees, partners, and investors.  15Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION. Given the TAG acquisition which took place on September 15, 2024, the Company plans to fully integrate and develop the TAG GRID and grow the business through expanding its residential and commercial customer base and exploring additional acquisition opportunities to do the same. We have a limited history as a public company. We currently file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and SEC regulations. Thus, we will need to ensure that we will have the ability to prepare, on a timely basis, financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements following the effectiveness of this registration statement. We will also become subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the listing standards of any securities exchange upon which we may list our Common Stock, and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. As a public company, we will be required, among other things, to:  ·prepare and distribute reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and the applicable national securities exchange listing rules; ·define and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors and its committees; ·institute more comprehensive compliance, investor relations and internal audit functions; ·evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management’s assessment thereof, in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC; and ·involve and retain outside legal counsel and accountants in connection with the activities listed above. The adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting must be assessed by management for each year commencing with the year ended September 30, 2023. Our internal control over financial reporting will be required to meet the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will incur additional costs in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting and comply with Section 404, including increased auditing and legal fees and costs associated with hiring additional accounting and administrative staff. Ultimately, our efforts may not be adequate to comply with the requirements of Section 404. If we are unable to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or otherwise to comply with Section 404, we may be unable to report financial information on a timely basis, may suffer adverse regulatory consequences, may have violations of the applicable national securities exchange listing rules and may breach covenants under our credit facilities. The significant obligations related to being a public company will continue to require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight that will increase our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management’s attention might be diverted from other business concerns. In addition, we might not be successful in implementing and maintaining controls and procedures that comply with these requirements. If we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment or to comply with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed on public companies, we could make material errors in, and be required to restate, our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC.  16Table of Contents Results of Operations and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The results of operations are based on preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations for years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 Revenues. Total Revenue. The Company had revenues of $52,400 for the year ended September 30, 2024. The Company had no revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023. Expenses. Cost of Goods Sold. The Company had total costs of goods sold of $20,877 for the year ended September 30, 2024. There were no costs of goods sold for the year ended September 30, 2023. Total Operating Expenses. The Company had operating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 of $310,096 and $395,456, respectively. Financial Condition. Total Assets. The Company had total assets at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 of $30,270,399 and $588, respectively. Total assets increased due to the TAG merger transaction on September 15, 2024. Total Liabilities. The Company had total liabilities at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 of $7,354,162 and $412,477, respectively. Total liabilities consisted of accounts payable and other current liabilities of $7,217,218 and $286,127 and other long-term debt of $136,944 and $126,350, at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in total liabilities is due to the TAG merger transaction on September 17, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company sustained a loss of $20,426 and $399,918 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has accumulated losses totaling $10,434,110 and $10,177,748 at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Unless the merger with the Awareness Group enables the Company to generate increased positive cash flows from operations, it will require additional funding to continue those operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  17Table of Contents We are presently able to meet our obligations as they come due. At September 30, 2024 we had a working capital surplus of $3.9 million. The working capital surplus is directly related to the TAG transaction that took place on September 17, 2024 and the assets and liabilities that were acquired. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2024 totaled $99,214 versus a use of cash of $51,706 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities includes our net operating results, stock-based compensation, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued interest. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2024 totaled $3,987 versus cash provided by financing activities of $52,117 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in or provided by financing activities includes net payments made on notes payable of $3,987 for the year-ended September 30, 2024 and net proceeds of $2,617 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, for the year-ended September 30, 2023, the Company had cash proceeds of $49,500 associated with transactions in its common stock. Our future liquidity requirements will be dependent upon our operating results, payment of our current obligations and any future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in generating sufficient operating cash flow or identifying additional funding on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then we may not be able to expand our operations. See “Note 3 – Going Concern” in our consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.” We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity. Capital Resources. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. The registrant qualifies as a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and is not required to provide the information required by this Item.  18Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm and the financial statements listed on the accompanying index at page F-1 of this report are filed as part of this report and incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. We did not have any disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure with our accounting firm during the reporting period. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Management also conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. This conclusion results from material weaknesses identified in connection with the restatement of previously issued financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Specifically, we identified material weaknesses related to:  ·Inadequate procedures to identify and record transactions in the correct accounting periods. ·Insufficient internal controls over the classification and documentation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities. ·Lack of proper review procedures and segregation of duties in the preparation of financial statements.  These material weaknesses resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements and may result in additional material misstatements going undetected in the future. Accordingly, we have determined that our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Remediation Plan We have begun to implement a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses described above, which includes:  ·Engaging additional qualified financial and accounting personnel; ·Enhancing our internal documentation and financial review processes; ·Improving accounting software and implementing additional levels of transaction review; ·Engaging external advisors to assist in ongoing accounting and control improvements.  We believe these steps will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting; however, the material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls have been operational for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that they are effective. The management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC applicable to smaller reporting companies. This report shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.  19Table of Contents (b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have not made any significant changes to our internal controls subsequent to the Evaluation Date.

Unless otherwise indicated, the beneficial owner has sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares of common stock. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons. None Director Independence. We have not established our own definition for determining whether our director or nominees for directors are “independent”, nor have we adopted any other standard of independence employed by any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, although two of our current Directors would be deemed to be “independent” under any applicable definition. We also have not established any committees of the Board of Directors. Given the nature of our Company, its limited shareholder base and the current composition of management, the Board of Directors does not believe that we require any corporate governance committees currently. As our operations generate revenue, we intend to seek additional members for our Board of Directors and establish our own definition of “independent” as related to directors and nominees for directors. We further intend to establish committees that will be suitable for our operations as our business operations warrant. Our Company retained the services of Olayinka Oyebola & Co. to conduct the September 30, 2024 audit and a re-audit of the September 30, 2023 financial statements.

(the ‘Company’) as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity / (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going ConcernThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $(10,434,110), net loss of $(20,426). These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. /s/ Olayinka Oyebola OLAYINKA OYEBOLA & CO. (Chartered Accountants) Lagos, Nigeria  We have

STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Freedom Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Maryland, United States of America on June 15, 2005. Since inception and up until the September 17, 2024 merger with The Awareness Group (“TAG”) (see Note 4 – Merger Transaction) the Company has devoted substantially all its efforts to establishing a new business. The Company generated expenses and limited revenue from these efforts. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities and the ability to secure additional funding if needed to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company has adopted a September 30 fiscal year end. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, which include the accounts for TAG and its majority owned subsidiaries including Candela Coin, Captain Manicorn and Standard Eco. Any non-controlling interests associated with these subsidiaries is separately disclosed in the financial statements. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentrations of Credit Risk We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We don’t believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk with cash. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization with the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement.  F-7Table of Contents  The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement” are described below: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of accounts payable, advances payable and short-term loans approximate their fair value due to short term maturities. Revenue Recognition The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers”.  Specifically, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale and installation of solar systems on a milestone basis.  As these milestones are achieved the corresponding costs and revenue are recognized.  To the extent that financing is provided, the Company recognizes interest over the term of the financing arrangement.   Cost of Sales Cost of sales is principally comprised of equipment and labor.  These costs are recognized as they are incurred. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents for the years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were $95,815 and $588, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of internally created crypto tokens that are held for sale.  The tokes are adjusted to fair value based on current market prices. Property, Plant & Equipment Property, plant & equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives shown below. Building and improvements 35 yearsEquipment, furniture and fixtures 5 yearsSoftware 3 yearsLeasehold improvements The lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life  There was no depreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively as the Company had no depreciable property, plant & equipment prior to the TAG transaction. Depreciation of the property, plant & equipment acquired as part of the TAG transaction began in October 2024. Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There are no potentially dilutive shares of common stock.  F-8Table of Contents FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INCNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023  Share-based expense ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees”. Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. Share-based expense was $254,000 and $351,000 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, as clarified by ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the “more likely than not” criteria of ASC 740. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company has applied for an extension of time to file with the Internal Revenue Service for its most recent tax filing. The Company recognizes expenses for tax penalties and interest assessed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities upon receiving valid notice of assessments. The Company has received no such notices as of September 30, 2024. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets because it is not currently able to conclude that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered to be realizable could be increased in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased.  F-9Table of Contents FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INCNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023  As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unused net operating loss carry forwards of $258,000 available to reduce future federal taxable income. The Company’s ability to offset future taxable income, if any, with net operating loss tax carryforwards may be limited due to the non-filing of tax returns. Under the CARES act, net operating losses arising after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely. Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Related Parties The Company follows ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Recently issued accounting pronouncements The Company has reviewed the FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of the Company’s financial management. NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company only began generating revenue with the TAG transaction on September 17, 2024 (see Note 4 – Merger Transaction) and has an accumulated deficit of $10,434,110 at September 30, 2024. Further, the Company had a net loss of $20,426 and $399,918 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 4 – MERGER TRANSACTON On September 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with TAG. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transaction, TAG was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary. The transaction closed on September 17, 2024. Since that date, TAG’s operating results have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and all assets and liabilities have been included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Under the Merger Agreement, the TAG shareholders received 32,740,942 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for assigning their LLC membership interests in TAG to the Company. As a result of the Merger, the Company is the sole member of TAG and TAG shareholders are the majority shareholders of the Company. Although shares were agreed to be exchanged as outlined, completion of all share exchanges was not fully completed until December 2024.  F-10Table of Contents FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INCNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023  The following reflects the TAG assets and liabilities at the transaction date:   2024 Current assets $9,815,248 Fixed assets  141,806 Intangible assets  1,603,430 Crypto assets  2,700,000 Other non-current assets  14,746,000 Total assets $29,006,484      Current liabilities $6,198,427 Notes payable  14,581 Total liabilities  6,213,008 Non-controlling interests  (6,647,080 )Net equity $28,572,412  The following depicts the proforma results for the Company for the year-ended September 30, 2024 as if the TAG transaction took place effective October 1, 2023:   2024 Revenues $1,471,230 Cost of sales  1,118,723 Gross margin  352,506 Operating expenses  668,133 Net operating income $(315,626)  Given the Company’s very limited operating activities prior to the September 17, 2024 TAG transaction, there were no pro forma adjustments deemed necessary. NOTE 5 – PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT Property, plant & equipment consists of the following at September 30, 2024:   2024 Autos and vehicles $87,204 Equipment  54,603 Total property, plant & equipment $141,806  There was no property, plant & equipment at September 30, 2023.  The assets were acquired as part of the TAG transaction on September 17, 2024.   F-11Table of Contents FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INCNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist of the following at September 30, 2024:    2024 Customer lists and memberships $569,430 Exchange contracts  457,000 Websites and software  185,000 Media materials  392,000 Total intangible assets $1,603,430  The Company had no intangible assets at September 30, 2023.

The loan incurs interest at 12% per annum. On August 7th, 2017, the Company obtained an additional unsecured, nonrecourse and open-ended loan of $50,000 from Mr. Miller. The loan incurs interest at 15% per annum. The loans require monthly repayment of principal and interest of $750.00 each, however the Company has not remained current on all required payments. Mr. Brian Kistler, a former related party of the Company, has also made loans to the Company under similar terms, to fund operating activities. The following sets forth the outstanding principal and accrued interest at September 30:   2024  2023 Note payable – Bruce Miller $86,289  $86,289 Note payable – New Opportunity Business Solutions (Brian Kistler)  36,074   40,061 Other  14,581   - Total note payable and accrued interest $136,944  $126,350  NOTE 10 – ACCRUED EXPENSES Accrued expenses totaled $82,470 and $241,627 at September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. NOTE 11 – EQUITY Preferred Stock The number of preferred shares outstanding on September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, was 0 and 0, respectively. Common Stock On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with MEDcann Industries in which MEDcann agreed to purchase 40 million common shares at $0.00125 for a total of $50,000 as disclosed in Form 8k filed with the SEC on 2-10-2023.

(See Note 4 – Merger Transaction for further details on share transfers.)  F-13Table of Contents FREEDOM HOLDINGS, INCNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 NOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% is being used due to the new tax law recently enacted. The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following at September 30:   2024  2023 Federal income tax benefit attributable to:      Current Operations $4,000  $84,000 Less: valuation allowance  (4,000 )  (84,000 )Net provision for Federal income taxes $—  $—  The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 21% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows at September 30:   2024  2023 Deferred tax asset attributable to:      Net operating loss carryover $258,000  $254,000 Less: valuation allowance  (258,000 )  (254,000 )Net deferred tax asset $—  $—  At September 30, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $258,000 that maybe offset against future taxable income. No tax benefit has been reported in the September 30, 2024 or 2023 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that effect 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statement was available to be issued and has determined that there are no material subsequent events that require disclosure in these financial statements other than,  F-14Table of Contents UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Defined terms included below have the same meaning as terms defined and included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K"). Introduction The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2024 gives pro forma effect to the Business Combination as if it had been consummated as of October 1, 2023. This information should be read together with audited financial statements of Freedom Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Parent”) for the year ended September 30, 2024 and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company" for the year ended September 30, 2024 included in and incorporated by reference into this 10-K. There is no unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 as the full effect of the Business Combination is already reflected in the September 30, 2024 balance sheet for Freedom Holdings, Inc. included in and incorporated by reference into this 10-K. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2024 has been prepared using the following:  ·Company's audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2024, incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.; and ·TAG's unaudited consolidated historical statement of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Description of the Transactions On September 9, 2024, the Parent entered into the Merger Agreement with TAG. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transaction contemplated thereby, TAG was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent. The Merger closed on September 17, 2024. Under the Merger Agreement, the Target Shareholders received 32,740,942 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for assigning their LLC membership interests in TAG to the Parent. As a result of the Merger, Parent is the sole member of TAG and TAG shareholders are the majority shareholders of Parent. Accounting for the Merger The Merger will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, TAG, who was the legal acquirer, will be treated as the "acquired" company for financial reporting purposes and Company will be treated as the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on TAG having a majority of the voting power of the post-combination company, TAG's senior management comprising substantially all of the senior management of the post-combination company, the relative size of TAG, and TAG's operations comprising the ongoing operations of the post-combination company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger will be treated as the equivalent of a capital transaction in which Company is issuing stock for the net assets of TAG. The net assets of TAG will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Merger will be those of Company. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the post-combination company upon consummation of the Business Combination. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma combined financial information as being indicative of the historical financial position and results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future financial position and results that the post-combination company will experience. Company and TAG did not have any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate activities between the companies. The following depicts the proforma results for the Company for the year-ended September 30, 2024 as if the TAG transaction took place effective October 1, 2023:   2024 Revenues $1,471,230 Cost of sales  1,118,723 Gross margin  352,506 Operating expenses  668,133 Net operating income $(315,626) Given the Company’s very limited operating activities prior to the September 17, 2024 TAG transaction, there were no pro forma adjustments deemed necessary.  F-15
