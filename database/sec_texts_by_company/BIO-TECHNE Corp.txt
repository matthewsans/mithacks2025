This segment also includes proteomic analytical tools, both manual and automated, that offer researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers efficient and streamlined options for protein analysis, automated western blot, and multiplexed ELISA workflows. Our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including controls, calibrators, and diagnostic assays for the regulated diagnostics market, exosome-based molecular diagnostic assays, advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays and instrumentation for spatial genomic and tissue biopsy analysis, and genetic and oncology kits for research and clinical applications.We are a Minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We were founded in 1976 as Research and Diagnostic Systems, Inc. We became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with Techne Corporation, now Bio-Techne Corporation. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “TECH.” We operate globally, with offices in many locations throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Today, our product lines include hundreds of thousands of diverse products, most of which we manufacture ourselves in multiple locations in North America, as well as locations in the U.K., Canada, Switzerland and China.We have implemented a disciplined strategy to accelerate growth in part by acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines, filled portfolio gaps with differentiated high growth businesses, and expanded our geographic scope. Recent examples include the investment in Spear Bio at the beginning of fiscal 2025 and the acquisition of Lunaphore SA (“Lunaphore”) at the beginning of fiscal 2024. We also completed a 19.9% investment in Wilson Wolf Corporation (“Wilson Wolf”) in fiscal 2023, and will acquire the remaining ownership in Wilson Wolf by the end of calendar year 2027, if not earlier due to its achievement of revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) targets. Recognizing the importance of an integrated, global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies, we have maintained many of the brands of the companies we have acquired, but unified under a single global brand -- Bio-Techne.We are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools that allow our customers to make extraordinary discoveries and treat and diagnose diseases. We intend to build on Bio-Techne’s past accomplishments, high product quality reputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research market, and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets. Our strategic pillars include:Grow & Leverage the Core. Through collaborations with key opinion leaders, participation in scientific discussions and societies, and leveraging our internal talent we expect to be able to convert our continued significant investment in our research and development activities to be first-to-market with quality products that are at the leading edge of life science researchers’ needs.Capitalize on High Potential Markets. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to gain access to new and differentiated technologies and products that improve our competitiveness in the current market, meet customers’ expanding workflow needs and allow us to enter adjacent markets.Market Expansion Through Innovation & Acquisition. We will leverage our existing portfolio to expand our product offerings into novel research fields and further penetrate diagnostics and therapeutics markets. 4
Table of ContentsAcquisitions have, and will likely continue to play, an important role in our efforts to expand our portfolio of innovative tools and bioactive reagents, and support our initiatives to enter adjacent markets.Deliver Best-in-Class Customer Experience. We will continue to expand our sales staff and distribution channels globally in order to increase our global presence and make it easier for customers to transact with us. We strive for every interaction to be seamless, personalized, and exceeding expectations. We aim to deeply understand customers’ wants and needs while simultaneously offering high-quality service at every touchpoint. Develop People Through a Transofrmative Culture. As we continue to grow both organically and through acquisition, we are intentionally fostering an “EPIC” culture based on the ideals of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration. We strive to recruit, train and retain the most talented staff, who share these EPIC ideals to effectively implement our global strategies.PROTEIN SCIENCES SEGMENTProtein Sciences Segment Products and MarketsThe Protein Sciences segment is the larger of our two segments, representing approximately 72% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. It is comprised of two divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the Reagent Solutions division and the Analytical Solutions division.The Reagent Solutions division consists of specialized proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, small molecules, tissue culture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by companies developing next generation diagnostics and therapeutics, including cell- and gene-based therapeutics. We believe we are the world leader in providing high quality proteins, both for research use and under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. Key product brands include R&D Systems, Tocris Biosciences and Novus Biologicals. Our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes, and, ultimately, to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address different pathologies. In recent years, we have made several acquisitions and investments that have expanded our product offerings for the cell and gene therapy market. These include a significant investment in state-of-the art facilities for production of both proteins and small molecules in large quantities manufactured in accordance with cGMP, as well as a 19.9% investment in, and eventual acquisition of , Wilson Wolf, a leading provider of cell culture devices for cell-based therapies. Through a collaborative marketing venture with Wilson Wolf and another company, we have leveraged the products we have or are developing to provide a more complete offering for the cell and gene therapy market.The Analytical Solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in quantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids. Products in this division include traditional manual plate-based immunoassays, fully automated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms, and automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of complex protein samples. Key product brands include R&D Systems and ProteinSimple. A number of our products have been demonstrated to have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer, autoimmunity, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, inflammation, neurological disorders, and kidney failure. Immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics. In fact, we have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices. Protein Sciences Segment Customers and Distribution MethodsOur customers for this segment include researchers in academia and industry (chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as contract research organizations). This segment also sells to diagnostic/companion diagnostic and therapeutic customers, including those engaged in the development of cell- and gene-based therapies. Our biologics line of products in the Analytical Solutions division is used chiefly by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies. We sell our products directly to customers who are primarily located in North America, Europe and China, as well as through a distribution agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific. We also sell through third 5
Table of Contentsparty distributors in China, Japan, certain eastern European countries and the rest of the world. Our sales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of the Protein Sciences segment’s net sales during fiscal 2025, 2024, or 2023.DIAGNOSTICS AND SPATIAL BIOLOGY SEGMENTThe Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment, representing approximately 28% of our net revenues in fiscal 2025, includes three divisions and is focused primarily on the diagnostic and research markets and includes spatial biology, liquid biopsy, molecular diagnostics kits and products, and diagnostics reagents.Diagnostics and Spatial Biology Segment ProductsThe Spatial Biology division products sold under the Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD, brand, are novel in-situ hybridization (ISH) assays for transcriptome, DNA copy, and structural variation analysis within intact cells, providing highly sensitive and specific spatial information at single cell resolution. Since these products preserve spatial context, they are particularly useful for complex tissue profiling. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we closed on the acquisition of Lunaphore, a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions using precision microfluidic technology capable of revealing hyperplex proteomic and transcriptomic biomarkers in tumors and other tissues at single-cell and subcellular resolution. Lunaphore’s COMET instrument automates ACD’s RNAscope assays and utilizies antibodies to enable simultaneous hyperplex detection of protein and RNA biomarkers on the same slide at single-cell resolution.The Molecular Diagnostics division markets and sells products and services under the Exosome Diagnostics and Asuragen brands. The Exosome Diagnostics brand is based on exosome-based liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts. It includes the ExoDx Prostate test, which is a urine-based assay for early detection of high-grade prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for biopsy in men with grey-zone prostate specific antigen (PSA) scores. ExoDX Prostate is offered by Exosome Diagnostics as a lab-developed test. We have also licensed exclusively the ExoTRU kidney transplant rejection test to Thermo Fisher Scientific. We also sell products for genetic carrier screening, oncology diagnostics, molecular controls, and research under the Asuragen brand. The Diagnostic Reagents division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting. Also included are instrument and process control products for hematology, blood chemistry, blood gases, coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications. We often manufacture these reagents on a custom basis, tailored to a customer’s specific diagnostic assay technology. We supply these reagents in various formats including liquid, frozen, or in lyophilized form. Most of these products are sold on an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) basis to instrument manufacturers, with most products being FDA-cleared.Diagnostics and Spatial Biology Segment Customers and Distribution MethodsThe customers for the Spatial Biology division include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies. We sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in North America, Europe, and China, and through distributors elsewhere. In addition to being useful research tools, our DNA and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assays have diagnostics applications, and several are cleared or currently under review by the FDA in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. In the United States, we offer the ExosomeDx Prostate test to physicians using our lab-developed non-invasive urine-based assay for prostate cancer detection. Our diagnostic laboratory is certified under and regulated by the State of Massachusetts pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA. We reach our customers through physicians prescribing such tests for their patients. This test is also available in Europe as a CE-marked product. The Asuragen-branded products are sold primarily to laboratories for use in lab-developed tests or in kit form as regulated diagnostic tests.The majority of Diagnostic Reagents Division’s sales are through OEM agreements, but we sell some of our diagnostic reagent products directly to customers and, in Europe and Asia, also through distributors. No customer accounted for 10% or more of the reporting segment’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.6
Table of ContentsMANUFACTURING AND MATERIALSOur manufacturing operations use a wide variety of raw materials and components, including electronic components, chemicals and biological materials. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, which in certain cases includes the use of safety stock, alternative materials, and qualification of multiple supply sources.The majority of our products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders, other than our instruments and related cartridges, which are typically shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order. There was no significant backlog of orders for our products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date. For additional discussion of risks relating to supply chain and manufacturing, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”COMPETITIONAlthough our segments both generally operate in highly competitive markets, it is difficult to determine our competitive position, either in the aggregate or by segment, since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the Company, or any of its segments, does. Because of the range of the products and services we sell, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including a number of large, global companies or divisions of such companies with substantial capabilities and resources, as well a number of smaller, niche competitors with specialized product offerings. We have seen increased competition in a number of our markets as a result of the entry of new companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product line. Key competitive factors vary among the Company’s businesses, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality and safety, performance, delivery speed, application expertise, service and support, technology and innovation, distribution network, breadth of product, service and software offerings, and brand name recognition. We believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of many of our products and our product quality. For a discussion of risks related to competition, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”SEASONALITY OF BUSINESSBio-Techne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base, particularly for the Protein Sciences segment.There is also some seasonality for the ExosomeDx Prostate test, as patients tend to avoid scheduling medical appointments during the summer and other holidays. A majority of Diagnostics Reagents division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer. Consequently, sales for that division can be unpredictable, and not necessarily based on seasonality. As a result, we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment.GOVERNMENT CONTRACTSAlthough the Company transacts business with various government entities, no government contract is of such magnitude that renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government entity would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. As a party to these contracts, Bio-Techne does have to comply with certain regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” NEW PRODUCTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTWe believe that our future success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs. Bio-Techne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines. We also carry out research to develop new products that build upon and expand the technologies we acquire through our acquisition strategy. In fiscal 2025, we introduced over 400 new products. While this is an area of focus for the Company, there is no 7
Table of Contentsassurance that any of the products in the research and development phases can be successfully completed or, if completed, can be successfully introduced into the marketplace. HUMAN CAPITAL Through its subsidiaries, Bio-Techne employed approximately 3,100 full-time and part-time employees as of June 30, 2025, of whom approximately 2,300 were employed in the United States and approximately 800 outside the United States. None of the United States employees are unionized. Outside the United States, the Company has government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or work councils in certain countries.Bio-Techne is committed to attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining the best people possible from around the world to sustain and grow our leadership position in life sciences tools and diagnostics. We strive to create an employee experience that allows each to achieve their full potential. This is demonstrated by our EPIC values of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration. We continuously build on our people-first culture, led by uncompromising integrity, hosting a place of belonging, granting access to innovation and respecting human rights around the globe.Our people strategy spans multiple key dimensions, including the following:Culture and GovernanceOur four EPIC values of Empowerment, Passion, Innovation and Collaboration are the backbone for the way we approach the leadership and direction of our work force. Employees are empowered to realize their potential. Our culture supports and encourages a collaborative approach to working with each other and with our customers. We encourage innovation to continually improve our products, services and processes, and our passions for science and the missions of our customers are our guiding lights.Our EPIC values are embedded in our culture and practices. To further amplify our desired behaviors, we have an annual employee recognition program in which we ask for nominations and recognize winning individuals and teams across our business who have best demonstrated our EPIC values.Bio-Techne’s Board of Directors reviews management succession planning at least annually, and its Compensation Committee reviews the Company’s people strategy periodically in connection with significant initiatives and acquisitions, as well as part of its oversight of our executive and equity compensation programs. At the management level, our Chief Human Resources Officer, who reports directly to our President and CEO, is responsible for the development and execution of the Company’s people strategy.Engagement and BelongingOur engagement strategy focuses on developing the best workplace and best people leaders to meet our employees’ needs. We believe that strong employee engagement helps enable higher retention and better business performance. We assess our engagement performance through regular consultation with our managers. We also engage more formally via an annual engagement survey that assesses our employees’ overall experience. In 2025, two-thirds of our global workforce participated, and 75% of those who responded provided favorable feedback. While these responses were positive, our management used the responses to inform and shape our future employee-focused initiatives. These initiatives in the past have resulted in changes in programs and policies, including expansion of our management and leadership development programs, expansion of a parental leave program, introduction of flexible working, addition of an internal communications function, leadership engagement focused on transparency and stronger feedback follow-up, and expansion of the breadth and resources of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). In fiscal 2025, we empowered work/life integration through hybrid work models wherever feasible, continued to cultivate belonging and inclusion, and paved the path for career growth through the personalized development and individual action plans. We believe a culture of belonging is central to drive innovation, fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base. The Company’s executive-sponsored Belonging initiative is focused on providing a welcoming working environment for all employees, continued education, broadening our candidate pools, and implementing and sustaining programs. Under the guidance of our executive-sponsored Employee Resource Group 8
Table of ContentsCouncil, ERGs offer mentorship, support and engagement to help our employees succeed and thrive. As of June 30, 2025, we had 11 ERGs operating globally. As of June 30, 2025, 48% of our total employee population was female, and 43% of our managerial employees were female. 39% of our total employee population identified as nonwhite and 28% of our managerial employees identified as nonwhite.Recruitment and Retention Bio-Techne believes that sustaining its profitable growth will require a continued focus on recruiting and retaining top talent. We engage in a variety of recruiting strategies intended to locate and identify qualified candidates and create a talent pipeline. The Company offers competitive pay and benefits, from flexible work to financial planning resources to an employee stock purchase plan. In recent years, we bolstered our recruitment and retention efforts by expanding eligibility to receive stock options deeper into the organization and expanded our Long-Term Incentive program strategy to include a combination of stock options and restricted stock units. Bio-Techne continues to offer a referral bonus with the understanding that this is one of our most successful sourcing methods. In addition to pay and benefits, Bio-Techne believes that the ability to retain employees requires an environment where they can work productively and where there are opportunities to grow and advance. The Company therefore seeks to cultivate a culture of empowerment and collaboration, where employees can observe the impact of their efforts, and where they see opportunities both laterally and vertically. The last fiscal year continued to see considerable employee mobility across all industries, including the biotechnology industry, but we nonetheless significantly reduced our attrition rate to maintain durable stability across our enterprise. We believe that Bio-Techne’s sustained efforts on recruitment and retention will fortify our resilience in the face of increased employee mobility and economic challenges.Talent Development and Learning and DevelopmentBio-Techne invests in people development in the belief that growing and promoting employees from within the Company creates a more sustainable organization. High potential employees are identified through our annual talent review process, as well as through leadership development programs designed to cultivate future leaders. Employees identified as high potential are elevated to the attention of senior management for consideration for additional development, growth opportunities, and career advancement.Our global Learning and Development program delivers a wide range of initiatives including a validated suite of compliance training, and soft, technical, business, interpersonal and career skills. Bio-Techne also encourages and supports employees who wish to supplement their growth through external training and education. As a company that regularly acquires other businesses, we believe it is important for employees to be trained in the skills and mindsets that enable them to respond positively to change. This initiative allows individuals to deal with change more easily and reduces the need to run large scale change management programs.Well-Being and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting the physical health, safety, and psychological well-being of our employees by providing a safe work environment and permitting hybrid work schedules wherever feasible. We actively monitor and adjust our crisis management plan and response protocol to protect our employees. Bio-Techne trains all employees on foundational safety principles and requires more rigorous safety and hazard awareness training where appropriate based on function, role, or team. At Bio-Techne, all employees are empowered and encouraged to maintain and create a safe workplace. In addition, we offer internal and external resources to provide for the psychological and emotional security of employees, including employee resource programs, mental health benefit coverage, and flexible work for many roles.CommunityThe Company believes in giving back and in supporting the local communities in which we live and work. The Company and its employees donate financially and by giving their time and energy. Most sites or departments engage in local 9
Table of Contentscharitable causes and activities. In some of our sites, employees are encouraged to give through regular payroll deductions and through the annual campaign week where employee contributions are matched by the Company. In addition, United States employees receive a paid day off to participate in local opportunities to give back to the community as part of our volunteer time off benefit.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections in our terms and conditions and other sales-related documentation.As of June 30, 2025, we had rights to approximately 1,340 granted patents and approximately 270 pending patent applications. Products in the Analytical Solutions and the Spatial Biology divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents. In addition, certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio. Patent protection, if granted, generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant. We cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent, whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products or services.In addition to pursuing patents on our products, we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets, particularly in the Reagent Solutions division of our Protein Sciences segment. Where appropriate, we use trademarks or registered trademarks in connection with our products. We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. See the description of risks associated with the Company’s intellectual property in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”We can give no assurance that Bio-Techne’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others. Bio-Techne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products. Where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights, Bio-Techne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive and/or non-exclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research and/or diagnostics markets.All trademarks, trade names, product names, graphics, and logos of Bio-Techne contained herein are trademarks and registered trademarks of Bio-Techne or its subsidiaries, as applicable, in the United States and/or other countries. Solely for convenience, we may refer to trademarks in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without the ™ or ® symbols. Such references are not intended to indicate that we will not assert our full rights to our trademarks.LAWS AND REGULATIONSOur operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex laws and regulations governing the production, marketing, handling, transportation, and distribution of our products and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations pertinent to the Company. These are not the only laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s business. For a description of risks related to laws and regulations to which we are subject, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Medical Device RegulationsA number of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes and orders, including but not limited to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA regulates the design, development, testing, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products. Many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.10
Table of ContentsAny medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and non-U.S. agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation (“QSR”), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”), requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury it if were to recur.Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.In the European Union (“EU”), our products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states, which are currently based on a Directive of the European Commission. Additionally, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostics medical devices that have been marketed and sold under the prior regulatory regime now have to comply with some of the new EU IVDR requirements, while the effective date of other requirements have been delayed. Complying with EU IVDR may require material modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions, updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases, among other changes.One of our products under our Exosome Diagnostics brand is offered as a test by a certified laboratory under CLIA. Our Asuragen business also maintains a CLIA certification. Consequently, we must comply with state licensing regulations applicable to laboratories regulated under CLIA, governing laboratory practices and procedures.Other Healthcare LawsSome of the products and services we sell, predominantly in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment, are subject to various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information, including, among others:●U.S. federal regulations regarding quality and cost by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud.​●U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.​●Comparable laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed above and below, including the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws.​●The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, 11
Table of Contentsmandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information.​●The False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government.​●The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare to, in certain circumstances, record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to HHS for subsequent public disclosure, as well as similar reporting requirements in some states and in other countries.​For a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Data Privacy and Security LawsAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. In addition to the U.S. HIPAA privacy and security rules mentioned above, which impact some parts of our business, individual states also regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. In particular, a broad privacy law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), came into effect in January 2020. The CCPA has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below) and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 (“GDPR”) has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect, transmit, process, and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities and prompt notice to data subjects with significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries in which we do business have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. For a discussion of risks related to improper disclosure of private information particularly as a result of cyber security incidents, please refer to section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Environmental Health and Safety LawsWe are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and research activities involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those relating to the transportation of hazardous materials.Other Laws and Regulations Governing Our Sales, Marketing and Shipping ActivitiesWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and various other similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery acts, which are particularly relevant to our operations in countries where the customers are government entities or are controlled by government officials. Both directly and indirectly through our distributors, we must comply with such laws when interacting with those entities.As Bio-Techne’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. Other nations’ governments have implemented similar export/import control and economic sanction regulations, which may affect the Company’s operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions.In addition, under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the United States are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the United States or between the United States and countries outside of the United States. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.12
Table of ContentsWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could cause a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.For a discussion of risks related to the above-referenced regulations, particularly with respect to our international operations, please refer to section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”INVESTOR INFORMATIONWe are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).

Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSSet forth below are risks and uncertainties we believe are material to our investors. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the section titled Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Economic and Industry RisksConditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets, whether brought about by material global crises or other factors, may adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is sensitive to global economic conditions. Slower economic growth in the domestic or international markets, inflation, recession, volatility in the credit and currency markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, labor availability constraints, public health crises, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax or monetary policies, government budget dynamics (particularly in the healthcare and scientific research areas), and other challenges in the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers, and suppliers. Without limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:●adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for many of our products;​●constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain, which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products;​●adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable, including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables, as well as the risk of excess or obsolete inventory;​●price increases in our raw materials and capital equipment, as well as increasing price competition in our markets;​●adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees;​●increased risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and​●adverse impact to the sizes and growth rates of the markets we serve.​If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial results can be adversely affected.International political, compliance and business factors, including the military conflict in Ukraine, Israel’s conflict in Gaza, and trade tensions between the U.S. and China, can negatively impact our operations and financial results.We engage in business globally, with approximately 44% of our sales revenue in fiscal 2025 coming from outside the U.S. Changes, potential changes or uncertainties in social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system, can adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, Congress and the U.S. administration have sought to impose changes to healthcare in the United States, including government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. Such impacts could negatively impact certain markets we serve, resulting in an adverse impact on our sales revenue. 14
Table of ContentsPolitical and military conflicts may disrupt our business or negatively impact global economic or business conditions. For example, Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, and the response by the US and European countries to that invasion, have caused severe political, humanitarian and economic crises, not only in Europe but globally. Restrictions on trade, particularly involving certain foods and energy supplies, have increased prices, led to widespread inflation and otherwise aggravated economic challenges. While we have not historically had significant business in either Russia, Ukraine, or Israel, the broader impact of the conflict could negatively impact our operations and financial results.One of our strategies is to expand geographically, particularly in China, India and in developing countries, both through distribution and through direct operations. This subjects us to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases. In addition, geopolitical tensions with these countries could exacerbate these risks.The application of laws and regulations impacting global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S.We continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. Any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties.The healthcare and life sciences industries that we serve face constant pressures and changes in an effort to reduce healthcare costs or increase their predictability, all of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.Our Protein Sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions. Research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. 15
Table of ContentsOur Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment products include applications in the medical diagnostics market, which relies largely on government healthcare-related policies and funding. Changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. For example, our Exosome Diagnostics business develops and sells novel exosome-based diagnostic tests. While we received public payer coverage for certain indications, we have also sought expanded coverage from public payors as well as coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from additional private payers. The process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict, and reimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment (such as prior authorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions) may be implemented from time to time. Additionally, the U.S. government’s plans to manage prescription drug prices, as well as its recently announced intention to regulate lab developed tests, may impact the customers and industries we serve by increasing the cost of commercializing and/or limiting the profitability of commercialized products. Payor actions and changes may have a material adverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with our diagnostics products and services.Acquisition and Investment RisksOur inability to complete acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.One of our key strategies is growth through acquisition of other businesses and assets. Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers or investors, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships, if not properly implemented or integrated, could negatively impact our business and financial results.As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course of business, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we invested in Spear Bio and at the beginning of fiscal year 2024 we completed the acquisition of Lunaphore, a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. Bio-Techne also obtained a 19.9% ownership stake in Wilson Wolf and will acquire the remaining ownership no later than the end of calendar year 2027. We have also continued participating in our collaborative marketing venture, ScaleReady LLC, with Wilson Wolf and another partner, which addresses the needs of the rapidly expanding cell and gene therapy market. While we believe these business ventures will advance our business strategies and support our growth plans, we may not be successful in managing or integrating them into our Company. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of additional financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results:●businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid, fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve and/or sustain profitability;​●we from time to time incur or assume debt in connection with our acquisitions and investments, which can result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets;​●acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;​16
Table of Contents●acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we may be unable to effectively address;​●we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures, personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers;​●we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship;​●we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;​●in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results; and​●investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we may not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.​We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired, which could negatively impact our financial results or stock price.We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our Company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. We may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.In addition, the Company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the Company’s business. These strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected. Strategic and Operational RisksOur success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified and diverse personnel and creating and maintaining a culture that successfully integrates the employees joining through acquisitions.Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production, sales and marketing, and management personnel representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets are critical to our success. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our businesses, particularly in the areas of science and technology, is extremely competitive. While retention improved in fiscal 2025, a number of our businesses and departments continued to face recruitment and retention challenges, and faced labor availability constraints and inflationary costs. Our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees. As we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate new workforces, some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing. The failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.17
Table of ContentsOur growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization of new and enhanced products and services that meet our customers’ needs. Our growth can also be negatively impacted if our customers do not grow as anticipated.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and new market entrants and competitors. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial results will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:●correctly identify and/or predict customer needs and preferences;​●allocate our research funding to products with higher growth prospects;​●anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations;​●differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid our products from becoming commodities;​●innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets we serve;​●obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies;​●successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;​●obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to certain diagnostic medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and​●stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.​If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share or need to reduce prices to remain competitive.We face intense competition across most of our product lines. Competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational, and research and development resources than us. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on us. Moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. The entry into the market by manufacturers in countries in Asia and other low-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices). Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial results, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.18
Table of ContentsA significant disruption in, or breach of security of, our information technology systems or data, or violation of data privacy laws, could result in damage to our reputation, data integrity and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements.The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) can be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks can also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. These attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other disruptions and damage can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personally identifiable information, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or integrate new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements.If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems or appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, a small number of our businesses are subject to HIPAA. Entities that violate HIPAA due to a breach of unsecured patient health information, or that arise from a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Individual states regulate data breach and security requirements, and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. Most notably, in the last several years, some states, including California, Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Connecticut, have passed broad privacy legislation that could result in more material impacts as implementing regulations are issued. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial results.19
Table of ContentsIf we suffer loss to our supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, power shortage or outage, public health crisis (including epidemics and pandemics) and the reaction thereto, war, terrorism, riot or other man-made or natural disasters. If any of these supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.The manufacture of many of our products is a complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our business and financial results could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements for some of our products. Problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with reliable sourcing of raw materials or components, natural disasters and environmental factors, and, if not discovered before the product is released to market, can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the quality requirements of some of our customers as well as stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, alternative manufacturing or sourcing is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial results.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions or customer demand, our business and financial results may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in many of our manufacturing operations. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase, or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial results may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain materials from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions (such as trade protectionism) and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity may exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.20
Table of ContentsThe Company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products which, if disrupted, could materially impair our business operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.The Company’s internal quality control, packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the Company’s sales. Since certain Company products must comply with FDA regulations and because in all instances, the Company creates value for its customers through the development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. While we have taken certain steps to manage these operational risks, the Company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions.We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Climate change and/or related environmental risks, or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and/or related environmental risks, may negatively affect us.Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations. For example, we have significant operations in California, where serious drought has made water less available and more costly and has increased the risk of wildfires. Changes in climate patterns leading to extreme heat waves or unusual cold weather at some of our locations can lead to increased energy usage and costs, or otherwise adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems. Concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Any such new or additional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with, or disrupt, sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may result in the loss of business, adverse reputational impacts, diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability.Defects, unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial results.Certain of our products and services are sold for use in diagnostics. For those products and services in particular, manufacturing or design defects in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, and/or property damage and adversely affect our business and financial results. These events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.21
Table of ContentsBecause we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.Most of our reagent products need to be stored and shipped at certain cold temperatures. Consequently, we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers by express mail or air delivery through package delivery companies, such as FedEx in the U.S. and DHL in Europe. If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property RisksWe are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights.These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. We operate globally, with manufacturing operations in Canada, Switzerland, China and the UK, and approximately 44% of our revenue in fiscal 2025 was from outside the United States. The laws, regulations and enforcement mechanisms in other countries may in some cases be less protective of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business and financial results.We may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact our business.Our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate. We have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others. Since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products, it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties.We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits are expensive, take significant time, and divert management’s focus from other business concerns. If we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, we could be required to cease certain activities, alter 22
Table of Contentsour products or processes or pay licensing fees. This could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. In addition, if we do not prevail, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect our earnings.Financial and Tax RisksWe have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility, and we may incur additional debt in the future. The burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy.We currently have a Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400 million subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. As of August 16, 2025, the Company had drawn $313 million under the Credit Agreement. ​The terms of the Credit Agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such as:●limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;​●increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and competitive conditions; and​●increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates.​The Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, the Company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.Our business and financial results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our tax rates and tax liabilities and assessments (including as a result of changes in tax laws).International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency"). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. In fiscal 2025, currency translation had a favorable effect of approximately $3 million on revenues due to the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the Company sells products and services.23
Table of ContentsAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the United States. We anticipate that there may be additional impact to us in the future from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.In preparing our financial results, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.For many years, our Board has declared quarterly dividends. In the future, our Board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational RisksOur business is subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.As referenced in more detail above, we and our customers must comply with a wide array of federal, state, local and international regulations, in such areas as medical device, healthcare, import and export, anticorruption, and privacy. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs and diagnostic products. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of drug or medical device products, such as managing the price of certain prescription drugs or potentially increasing regulatory scrutiny of lab developed tests, could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the U.S. and elsewhere and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government (less than 2% of our fiscal 2025 sales were made to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of, the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. For example, the EU has adopted the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostics medical devices that have been marketed and sold under the prior regulatory regime now have to comply with some of the new EU IVDR requirements, while the effective date of other requirements have been delayed. Complying with EU IVDR, the regulation applicable to the Company, may require material modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions, updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases, among other 24
Table of Contentschanges. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of the EU IVDR, or other requirements imposed by these or similar regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. We are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers’ ability to provide products to their customers.We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-competition laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Significant developments or changes in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Significant developments or changes in U.S. laws and policies (including as a result of changes in party control of Congress or decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court), such as laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial results. Developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements. Developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition, including laws and policies in areas such as trade, manufacturing, government purchasing, healthcare, intellectual property, regulatory enforcement and investment/development, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. The U.S. has announced and/or implemented new tariffs on imports from a wide range of countries, which has prompted retaliatory tariffs, or changes to existing tariffs, by a number of countries. Beginning in early April 2025, the U.S. implemented and/or announced tariffs on imports from a wide range of countries, and which has prompted a number of countries to impose retaliatory tariffs and/or changes to existing tariffs. Many of these tariffs and announcements underwent continued revision, with certain tariff levels increasing while others decreased. Additionally, the U.S. and a number of other countries have implemented a number of product- and industry- specific exclusions, though these exclusions have been subject to revision and/or announced revision as well. As of the date of this report, a number of the recently-imposed tariffs remain in effect, including significant tariffs between the U.S. and China. Collectively, these tariffs have increased and will continue to increase the cost to us of supplies and components we import, as well as our cost to serve certain markets, which in turn will require us to bear significant increased costs to do business, and/or implement surcharges, and/or increase the price of certain of our products. As a result of any surcharge or price increase, there may be an adverse impact on the demand for our products, as well as an adverse impact as to our ability to serve the market in certain countries. The increased cost of importing raw materials and components from certain countries may disrupt our supply chains, with related impacts to our operations. In addition, whenever we are unable to fully recover higher costs, or whenever there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover these costs, our margins and profitability can decline. The U.S. and/or other countries may implement additional tariffs and/or other responsive or retaliatory measures, and which would exacerbate the risks and adverse effects noted above. Though the risks identified above in certain cases have already adversely impacted parts of our business, the full impact of these tariffs and other actions on the Company and on our business partners remains highly uncertain and subject to rapid change. 25
Table of ContentsIn addition, changes to laws or regulations pertraining to laboratory developed tests may adversely affect our business and financial results. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial results.Our business and financial results can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, protect us from unauthorized acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial results.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.Certain of our products are medical devices, diagnostics tests and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA or state CLIA regulations, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse, or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials. The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations, including implementation of IVDR regulations in Europe. Failure to meet these requirements may adversely impact our business and financial results in the applicable geographies.​26
Table of ContentsGovernment authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs.More specifically, as a healthcare provider, the Company’s Exosome Diagnostics’ ExoDx Prostate business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state, and local levels in the U.S. and other countries where it operates. The Company’s failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health systems, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and possibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties.Failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the Company’s reputation and have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, a risk that has been elevated with recent acquisitions that use protected health information and utilize healthcare providers for laboratory testing services.If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties and/or criminal sanctions. In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. HIPAA restricts the Company’s ability to use or disclose PHI, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. If the laboratory operations use or disclose PHI improperly under these privacy regulations, they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties.​27

CYBERSECURITYCybersecurity Governance and OversightBio-Techne’s cybersecurity program is led by the Company’s Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), with day-to-day management and administration of our cybersecurity program performed by the Director of IT Infrastructure and Security and the IT Security Operations team. The Director of IT Infrastrcuture and Security reports to the CIO, and the CIO reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The CIO is supported by the Incident Response Team (“IRT”), a multi-disciplinary management committee comprising senior members from the Security Operations Team, legal, finance, internal audit and other functions. The IRT supports the CIO in supporting and reviewing information security risks and in the event of a cybersecurity incident provides leadership with respect to incident response, investigation, mitigation and remediation. ​In addition to leadership and support within management, we also work with security service providers to monitor for vulnerabilities and threats, and which are reported to the Security Operations team. All employees are trained and tested annually on cybersecurity risks, and we continually perform simulated phishing exercises. We also conduct periodic tabletop exercises for key personnel involved in cybersecurity risk management, including the IRT.​Our Board of Directors (“Board”) holds overall oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategy and risk management, including in relation to cybersecurity risks. The Board exercises its oversight function through the Audit Committee, which oversees the management of risk exposure across various areas, including data security risks, in accordance with its charter. In addition, the Audit Committee is specifically responsible for the review and approval of any cybersecurity incident disclosure, as set forth in the Committee’s charter. In the event of a potentially significant cybersecurity incident, the Audit Committee’s charter requires that management promptly communicate and consult with the Audit Committee.​Bio-Techne’s General Counsel updates the Audit Committee multiple times per year regarding Bio-Techne’s cybersecurity programs, including regularly-tracked metrics on incident response, internal security testing, and measures implemented to monitor and address cybersecurity risks and threats, as appropriate. The Audit Committee regularly updates the full Board on these matters. In addition, on at least an annual basis, the CIO provides the full Board with a thorough review of the Company’s cybersecurity program, including current status, industry risks and exposure, and future strategy.​Based on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Bio-Techne, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors – “A significant disruption in, or breach of security of, our information technology systems or data, or violation of data privacy laws, could result in damage to our reputation, data integrity and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements.” ​Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Bio-Techne’s cybersecurity strategy is to maintain and fortify a secure, actively-monitored environment for our internal and our customers’ data while supporting our and our customers’ business needs.

This team leverages both Bio-Techne’s internal IT resources, including its personnel, as well as managed security service providers and other third-party security software and technology services, as well as through other means. We also have implemented processes and technologies for network monitoring and data loss prevention procedures.​We conduct periodic risk assessments, including with support from external vendors, to assess our cyber program, identify areas of enhancement, and develop strategies for the mitigation of cyber risks. We also conduct regular security testing and have established a vulnerability management process supported by security testing, for the treatment of identified security risks based on severity, including risks arising from our use of third-party providers software and service providers. In addition to our evolving processes and systems, we foster a culture of cybersecurity education, training, and testing. Every year, employees must take and pass rigorous information security and protection training. ​We partner with experienced external consultants to assess our cybersecurity program, and to perform penetration testing as well as other testing programs designed to identify vulnerabilities and areas for fortification. Also, as part of our cybersecurity risk management program we maintain cyber insurance, with coverage amounts and terms that are typical and appropriate for a company of our size and type. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover us against all types of claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. ​ITEM 2.

As disclosed in Note 4, the Company completed the acquisition of Lunaphore in fiscal 2024 for $169.7 million, in a cash-free, debt-free acquisition. We also purchased a 19.9% investment in Wilson Wolf in fiscal 2023 and, as disclosed in Note 1, will acquire the remaining shares in Wilson Wolf by the end of calendar year 2027, or earlier depending on the achievement of certain future milestones.OVERALL RESULTSOperational UpdateFor fiscal 2025, consolidated net sales increased 5% to $1.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2024. Organic growth was 5%, and foreign currency translation and a business held-for-sale did not have a material impact. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong commercial execution in our Protein Sciences segment.​Consolidated net earnings for fiscal 2025 decreased 56% compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease in earnings was impacted by a non-recurring loss on an arbitration award, impairment of assets held-for-sale, and restructuring and restructuring-related charges. After adjusting for cost recognized upon sale of acquired inventory, intangibles amortization, acquisition-related costs, certain litigation charges, gain on sale of investments, stock-based compensation, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, impairment of assets held-for-sale, and impact of business held-for-sale, adjusted net earnings 33
Table of Contentsincreased 8% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. Adjusted net earnings was primarily impacted by favorable volume leverage within Protein Sciences. For fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales increased 2% as compared to fiscal 2023. Organic growth was 1%, with acquisitions having a favorable impact of 1%. Foreign currency translation and a business held-for-sale did not have a material impact. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong commercial execution in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. Consolidated net earnings for fiscal 2024, including non-controlling interest, decreased 41% compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in earnings was driven by a non-recurring gain on the sale of our ChemoCentryx, Inc. (CCXI) investment, a non-recurring gain on the sale of our investment in Eminence, and a non-recurring benefit related to the fair value of contingent consideration during fiscal 2023.​RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet SalesConsolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of companies acquired during the first 12 months post-acquisition and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies (primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, and Swiss franc) into U.S. dollars.​Consolidated net sales growth was as follows:​​​​​​​​​    Year Ended June 30,  ​    2025    2024    2023 ​​​​​​​​Organic sales growth 5%  1%  5%  Acquisitions sales growth 0%  1%  0%  Impact of foreign currency fluctuations 0%  0%   (2)%  Impact of business held for sale​0%  0%   —%  Consolidated net sales growth 5%  2%  3%​Consolidated net sales by segment were as follows (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​    Year Ended June 30, ​    2025    2024    2023Protein Sciences​$ 870,245​$ 830,902​$ 845,747Diagnostics and Spatial Biology​  346,263​  326,392​  292,602Other revenue(1)​​ 4,152​​ 4,153​​ —Intersegment​  (1,025)​  (2,387)​  (1,647)Consolidated net sales​$ 1,219,635​$ 1,159,060​$ 1,136,702(1)Since December 31, 2023, the Company has a business that has met the held-for-sale criteria.

There was no comparable activity in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The Company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. We weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company’s business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. We may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.The fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as trade names and in-process research and development, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. The resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. The trade name fair value is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. Assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. In-process research and development assets are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method when the cash flows from the in-process research and development assets are separately identifiable from the primary asset. In circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset, they are valued using the distributor model income approach, which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customer-related assets, which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value.We estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. For potential payments related to financial performance based milestones, projected revenue and/or EBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts. For potential payments related to product development milestones, the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.We are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining 42
Table of Contentsuseful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.While we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. Additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. As goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis.Impairment of GoodwillGoodwillGoodwill was $980.9 million as of June 30, 2025, which represented 38% of total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.To analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation for goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply our fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. For fiscal 2025, we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the quantitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as part of restructuring actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment were classified as held-for-sale as of May 31, 2025. Given the upcoming divestiture, the Company identified a triggering event and performed impairment testing during May 2025. The impairment test resulted in a total impairment charge of $83.1 million, which includes the allocated goodwill, which we have further described within Note 14. The Company did not identify any additional triggering events 43
Table of Contentsafter our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2025, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.For fiscal 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as part of restructuring actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023. Given the upcoming divestiture, the Company identified a triggering event and performed impairment testing during the second half of fiscal 2024. The impairment test resulted in a total impairment charge of $22.0 million, which includes the allocated goodwill, which we have further described within Note 14. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.For fiscal 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2023. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2023, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSInformation regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2025 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption “Note 1: Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appear in Item 8 of this report.SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn August 5, 2025, the Company announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the Exosome Diagnostics business for $15 million including $5 million of stock of the acquiring company at closing with the remainder received over the following four years. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2026.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include:●Organic growth●Adjusted gross margin●Adjusted operating margin●Adjusted net earnings●Adjusted effective tax rate​We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.44
Table of ContentsOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the impact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. Revenues from businesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting on the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be comparative in future periods. Revenues from partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal 2025 and 2024 due to the sale of Eminence in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries was $2.0 million for fiscal 2023.Our non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude stock-based compensation, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, and other non-recurring items including non-recurring costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. We also exclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific including costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains and losses). In some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were not probable, inestimable, or unresolved at the time of acquisition. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures.The Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, gain and losses from investments, as they are not part of our day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future), certain adjustments to income tax expense, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to a new CEO. Additionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.The Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.Readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.​45
Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESABOUT MARKET RISKThe Company operates internationally, and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 32% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025 were made in foreign currencies, including 15% in euro, 4% in British pound sterling, 5% in Chinese yuan, 3% in Canadian dollars, 1% in Swiss francs, and the remaining 4% in other currencies. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc as compared to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation.Month-end exchange rates between the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar, which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods, were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​    ​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended June 30, ​​2025​2024​2023Euro ​​​​​​​​High​$ 1.17​$ 1.10​$ 1.10Low​  1.04​  1.06​  0.98Average​  1.09​  1.08​  1.05British pound sterling​ ​​ ​​ ​High​$ 1.37​$ 1.29​$ 1.27Low​  1.24​  1.22​  1.11Average​  1.30​  1.26​  1.21Chinese yuan​ ​​ ​​ ​High​$ 0.14​$ 0.14​$ 0.15Low​  0.14​  0.14​  0.14Average​  0.14​  0.14​  0.14Canadian dollar​​​​​​​​​High​$ 0.74​$ 0.76​$ 0.78Low​  0.69​  0.72​  0.73Average​  0.72​  0.74​  0.74Swiss franc​​​​​​​​​High​$ 1.26​$ 1.19​$ 1.12Low​  1.10​  1.09​  1.00Average​  1.16​  1.13​  1.07​The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements, but receivable or payable in another currency.The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other non-operating (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar from June 30, 2025 levels against the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Swiss francs are as follows (in thousands):​​​​Decrease in translation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries    $ 4,166Decrease in translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries​  60,580Additional transaction gain​  (698)46

Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of DirectorsBio-Techne Corporation:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.​We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.​Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.​We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.​Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.​Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales​As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for sales of consumables and instruments at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer. The Company recorded $1,219.6 million of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2025. ​48
Table of ContentsWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities across locations. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed. ​The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s net sales processes, including the Company’s controls over the accurate recording of sales amounts. We 1) performed software-assisted data analyses to test the relationships among certain sales transactions and 2) assessed the recorded net sales for a selection of transactions by comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers, shipping documentation, customer acceptance, and payments.​We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the nature and extent of such evidence.​/s/ KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.​Minneapolis, Minnesota​August 22, 2025​​​49
Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors Bio-Techne Corporation:Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated August 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.​Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.​Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.​/s/ KPMG LLPMinneapolis, Minnesota​August 22, 2025​​50

Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSBio-Techne Corporation and SubsidiariesYears ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:Description of business: Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (the Company), develop, manufacture and sell life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.At the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held on October 27, 2022, the shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 100,000,000 to 400,000,000. On November 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and declared a four-for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on November 14, 2022 received three additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, which were distributed after close of trading on November 29, 2022. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.Use of estimates: The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, available-for-sale investments, inventory, intangible assets, contingent consideration, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.Principles of consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As Eminence met the criteria for consolidation, the transaction was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations. In applying ASC 805 to the transaction, the Company has elected to include Eminence in our Consolidated Financial Statements on a one month lag. As noted below, Eminence was sold during the first fiscal quarter of 2023. Equity method investments: The Company accounts for its equity method investments in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. The Company initially records its equity method investments at the amount of the Company’s investment and adjusts each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Distributions from the equity method investee are accounted for using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.In December 2021, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to make an initial ownership investment followed by purchase of full equity interest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or annual EBITDA thresholds are met. Wilson Wolf is a leading manufacturer of cell culture devices, including the G-Rex product line. The first part of the forward contract was triggered upon Wilson Wolf achieving approximately $92 million in annual revenue or $55 million in EBITDA at any point prior to December 31, 2027. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company determined that Wilson Wolf had met the EBITDA target. On March 31, 2023, the Company paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.Since the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, and requires the Company to acquire the remaining equity interest in Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027 based on a revenue multiple of approximately 4.4 times trailing twelve month revenue. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027, if Wilson Wolf meets its second milestone of approximately $226 million 55
Table of Contentsin annual revenue or $136 million in annual EBITDA. If the second milestone is achieved, the forward contract requires the Company to pay approximately $1 billion plus potential consideration for revenue in excess of the revenue milestone.Translation of foreign financial statements: Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange and the resulting gains and losses arising from the translation of net assets located outside the U.S. are recorded as Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The cumulative translation adjustment is a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign statements of earnings are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other non-operating income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.Revenue recognition: ASC 606 provides revenue recognition guidance for any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policy under ASC 606.Research and development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development activities generally relate to creating new products, improving or creating variations of existing products, or modifying existing products to meet new applications.Advertising costs: Advertising expenses were $3.2 million, $4.1 million, and $4.8 million for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred.Income taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to record the income tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding income taxes.Comprehensive income: Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to shareholders’ equity that are not the result of transactions with shareholders. Our total comprehensive income consists of net income, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The items of comprehensive income, with the exception of net income, are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Any tax effects, if applicable, associated with reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income are reflected in the provision for income taxes. Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.Available-for-sale investments: Available-for-sale investments consist of debt instruments with original maturities of generally three months to less than one-year and equity securities. Available-for-sale investments are recorded based on trade-date. The Company considers all of its marketable securities available-for-sale and reports them at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities are included within Other income (expense).Trade accounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and they do not bear interest. They are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which represent estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make the required payments. When determining the allowances for doubtful accounts, we take several factors into consideration, including the overall 56
Table of Contentscomposition of accounts receivable aging, our prior history of accounts receivable write-offs, the type of customer and our day-to-day knowledge of specific customers. Changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts are included in Selling, general, & administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The point at which uncollected accounts are written off varies by type of customer. The Company does not have material long-term customer receivables. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration.For certain proteins, antibodies, and chemically based manufactured products, the Company produces larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale through a highly controlled manufacturing process. Accordingly, the manufacturing process for these products has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. The Company forecasts usage for its products based on several factors including historical demand, current market dynamics, and technological advances. The Company forecasts product usage on an individual product level for a period that is consistent with our ability to reasonably forecast inventory usage for that product. There have been no material changes to the Company’s estimates of the net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory or other types of inventory reserves and inventory cost adjustments in the fiscal years presented. Additionally, current and historical reserves recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value become part of the new cost basis for the inventory item in accordance with ASC 330 - Inventory.Property and equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years. Buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 5 to 40 years.Contingencies: The Company records a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. Contingent Consideration: Contingent Consideration relates to the potential payment for an acquisition that is contingent upon the achievement of the acquired business meeting certain product development milestones and/or certain financial performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred. For potential payments related to financial performance milestones, we use a real option model in calculating the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. The assumptions utilized in the calculation based on financial performance milestones include projected revenue and/or EBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates. For potential payments related to product development milestones, we estimated the fair value based on the probability of achievement of such milestones. The assumptions utilized in the calculation of the acquisition date fair value include probability of success and the discount rates. Contingent consideration involves certain assumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, and subsequent changes in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, are recognized within Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.Intangible assets: Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is generally determined on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 1 year to 20 years. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If our estimate of an asset’s remaining useful life is revised, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.Impairment of long-lived assets and amortizable intangibles: We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, equipment and amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, 57
Table of Contentsor (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. As quoted market prices are not available for the majority of our assets, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.The evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024 there was a triggering event for the assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment that were classified as held-for-sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 there was a triggering event for the assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics & Spatial Biology segment that were classified as held-for-sale. See Note 14 for additional details. No other triggering events were identified for property, plant, and equipment or amortizable intangibles during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a possible impairment. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (4) an adverse change in market conditions that are indicative of a decline in the fair value of the assets.To analyze goodwill, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business. The Company had five reporting units for our 2025, 2024, and 2023 goodwill impairment assessment performed on April 1 of each of the respective fiscal years, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation for goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based the income approach. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply our fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. In our fiscal 2025 annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all five of our reporting units. No impairment was identified as part of the analysis performed as the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. The Company did identify a triggering event related to a business held-for-sale, described in Note 14, in the fourth quarter after our annual goodwill impairment assessment, that led to an impairment of allocated goodwill.For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less 58
Table of Contentsthan the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024 and 2023. There was a triggering event related to a business held-for-sale described later in this note, leading to an impairment of allocated goodwill during the second half of fiscal 2024. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024 and 2023, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.For fiscal 2024, the Company also performed a qualitative assessment of the acquired in-process research and development assets to determine whether changes in events, circumstances, or the probability of successful development and commercialization of the assets indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the acquired assets are less than its carrying amount. Based on the analysis, the Company determined there was no indication of impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. This in-process research and development was placed into service during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and will begin amortization over its expected useful life.On September 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity shares of Eminence for approximately $17.8 million to a third party. Eminence was considered a variable-interest entity that was fully consolidated in our financial statements. Prior to the sale, Eminence had revenue of $2.0 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 within our Protein Sciences segment. As a result of the sale of the business, the Company recorded a gain of $11.7 million within the Other income (expense) line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Prior to the sale of Eminence, a triggering event was identified in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and impairment testing was performed as Eminence was forecasted to not have sufficient cash to execute on their growth plan combined with their inability to secure additional financing. Our impairment testing resulted in a full impairment of the Eminence goodwill and intangibles assets for charges of $8.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively, for fiscal 2022. The Company also recognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. These impairment charges were recorded within the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Eminence was able to secure cash deposits on future orders to provide funding for their operations. This delay in liquidation allowed time for securing of additional investor financing which coincided with the sale of the Company's investment.Restructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairments and disposals of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Asset-related and other charges include impairment of right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations, disposal of assets and other exit costs. Other costs also includes restructuring-related charges, which are incremental costs incurred directly supporting business transformation initiatives tied to the restructuring action. Refer to Note 14 for additional information regarding restructuring actions.Legal Matters: The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.​The Company records a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the 59
Table of Contentsestimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. ​In August 2024, 791,204 shares of outstanding vested stock options related to former employees expired, which have now been excluded from the Company’s dilutive EPS calculation for fiscal 2025. Of the 791,204 shares, 779,084 shares belonged to the Company’s former CEO. The expiration date of these options was previously under dispute. The dispute with the former CEO was resolved through a binding arbitration award during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 for which the Company paid $37.2 million inclusive of interest and legal fees. The dispute regarding the remaining 12,120 shares was resolved during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 resulting in total payments of $0.5 million.​During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized $41.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of certain litigation charges. There was no comparable activity in fiscal 2023. As of each of the balance sheet dates presented, there was no accrued litigation. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.​Intellectual Property Matters: At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements related to such rights. This litigation includes, but it not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other claims asserted by competitors, individuals, or entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages. ​Other Significant Accounting PoliciesThe following table includes a reference to additional significant accounting policies that are described in other notes to the financial statements, including the note number:​​​​​Policy    Note Fair value measurements  5 Leases​​7​Earnings per share  9 Share-based compensation  10 Operating segments  13 ​Newly Adopted Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280), which requires incremental disclosures on reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. The Company adopted this guidance beginning with this annual report and this guidance will be applied to interim periods starting in fiscal 2026 on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 13 for our segment reporting disclosures.Not Yet Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires incremental annual disclosures on income taxes, including rate reconciliations, income taxes paid, and other disclosures. 60
Table of ContentsThe Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 for our annual report. This accounting standard will increase disclosures in the Company’s annual reporting but will have no impact on reported income tax expense or related income tax assets or liabilities.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement –Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), which requires incremental disclosures on purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and other expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning with our annual report for fiscal 2027. This accounting standard will increase disclosures in the Company’s annual reporting but will have no impact on reported income statement expenses.Other than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that we believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 2. Revenue Recognition:Consumables revenues consist of specialized proteins, immunoassays, antibodies, reagents, blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, and hematology instrument controls that are typically single-use products recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues consist of extended warranty contracts, post contract support, and custom development projects that are recognized over time as either the customers receive and consume the benefits of such services simultaneously or the underlying asset being developed has no alternative use for the Company at contract inception and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the portion of the performance completed. Service revenues also include laboratory services recognized at point in time. We recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur using third party evidence. The Company elected the "right to invoice" practical expedient based on the Company's right to invoice a customer at an amount that approximates the value to the customer and the performance completed to date. The Company elected the exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less and the exemption to exclude future performance obligations that are accounted under the sales-based or usage-based royalty guidance. The Company’s unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year were not material as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. Contracts with customers that contain instruments may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Allocation of the transaction price is determined at the contracts’ inception. Payment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90 days. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended warranty and service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. custom development manufacturing) or a mix of both. Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings. Contract assets are included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as the amount of time expected to lapse until the Company's right to consideration becomes unconditional is less than one year. We elected the practical expedient allowing us to expense contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Contract assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 are not material. Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on warranty contracts. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 were approximately $35.3 million and $30.2 million, respectively. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 subsequently recognized as revenue in fiscal 2025 were approximately $26.2 million. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2023 subsequently recognized as revenue in fiscal 2024 were approximately $20.9 million. Contract liabilities in excess of one year are included in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 61
Table of ContentsAny claims for credit or return of goods must be made within 10 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns. Although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material.Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products. We elected the practical expedient that allows us to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost, and we accrue costs of shipping and handling when the related revenue is recognized.

Table of Contentsin our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income from their respective dates of acquisitions. Acquisition costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.Fiscal year 2025 Acquisitions ​There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2025.​Fiscal year 2024 Acquisitions ​Lunaphore Technologies SA. ​On July 7, 2023, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Lunaphore Technologies SA (“Lunaphore”) for $169.7 million, in a cash-free, debt-free acquisition. Lunaphore is a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. The Lunaphore acquisition adds spatial biology instruments to Bio-Techne’s portfolio to accelerate our leadership position in translational and clinical research markets. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s product portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The business became part of the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology operating segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. ​The allocation of purchase price consideration related to Lunaphore was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales and operating loss of this business included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2024 were approximately $14.3 million and $24.0 million, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements:The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration obligations, derivative instruments, and long-term debt.Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. This standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value. This standard maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances.The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 may also include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity or a decrease in the observability of market pricing for the investments, such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.The following tables provide information by level for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    Total     ​​​​​​​​​​​carrying ​​​​​​​​​​​​value as of​Fair Value Measurements Using ​Balance Sheet Location​June 30, ​Inputs Considered as​​​2025​Level 1​Level 2​Level 3​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​Assets​ ​   ​   ​   ​  Derivatives designated as hedging instruments - cash flow hedgesOther current assets​$ 2,843​$ —​$ 2,843​$ —Total assets​​$ 2,843​$ —​$ 2,843​$ —​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Liabilities​​   ​   ​   ​   Derivatives designated as hedging instruments - net investment hedgeOther long-term liabilities​$ 18,034​$ —​$ 18,034​$ —Total liabilities​​$ 18,034​$ —​$ 18,034​$ —​67

Fair value measurements of derivative instrumentsThe Company utilizes forward starting swaps designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt. The forward starting swaps reduce the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s forecasted variable interest long-term debt to that of a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, as part of the forward starting swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between floating and fixed interest amounts based on a notional principal amount. The Company also uses a cross-currency swap contract to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with the Company’s net investment in its Swiss subsidiary.The following table presents the contractual amounts of the Company’s outstanding instruments (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​    June 30, ​June 30, Instruments​Designation    2025​2024Forward starting swaps(1)​Cash flow hedge​$ 200​$300Cross-currency swap(2)​Net investment hedge​​ 140​​ 150(1)In May 2021, the Company entered into a forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on $200 million of notional principal. The effective date of the swap was November 2022 with the full swap maturing in November 2025.(2)In July 2023, the Company entered into a pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contract with a total notional amount of $150 million that was designated as a hedge to lock in the Swiss franc (CHF) rate for a portion of the Company’s CHF net investment in its Lunaphore subsidiary in Switzerland. The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the Company’s CHF-denominated operations against changes in the spot exchange rates, on a pre-tax basis. The hedging instrument has four interim settlement dates, which will reduce the notional on the hedging instrument by $10 million at each interim date, and will reduce the notional to $110 million at maturity. 68

Gains or losses related to the cash flow hedges are classified as Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges in the schedule of changes in AOCI in Note 8.The instruments were valued using observable market inputs in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2 liabilities.Fair value measurements of contingent considerationAs of December 31 2023, the Company's obligation for potential contingent consideration payments related to the Namocell and Asuragen acquisitions was relieved as the likelihood that the revenue thresholds and product milestones would be achieved in the timeframe established within the purchase agreement was remote. As a result, the Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities at the date of settlement during fiscal 2024, respectively. There was no contingent consideration throughout all of fiscal 2025.The following table presents a reconciliation of the liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​    ​​​​​​​​​June 30, ​​​2025​2024​​​​​​​​Fair value at the beginning of period​​$ —​$ 3,500Purchase price contingent consideration (Note 4)​​  —​  —Change in fair value of contingent consideration​​  —​  (3,500)Payments​​  —​  —Fair value at the end of period​​$ —​$ —​69
Table of ContentsThe use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to matters that inherently are subjective and changes in future market conditions could result in different estimates of fair value of our securities or contingent consideration, currently and in the future. If market conditions deteriorate, we may incur impairment charges for securities in our investment portfolio.Fair value measurements of other financial instruments – The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.Cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable – The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.Long-term debt – The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount drawn on our line-of-credit facility and long-term debt approximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates.​Note 6. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements:On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit and term loan by a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400 million subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries, including financing permitted acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. The current outstanding debt is based on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined from the total leverage ratio of the Company and updated on a quarterly basis. The annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is currently 10 basis points. The Credit Agreement matures on August 31, 2027 and contains customary restrictive and financial covenants and customary events of default. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $346.0 million and $319.0 million, respectively.Note 7. Leases:As a lessee, the Company leases offices, labs, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. The Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception date. Upon commencement date, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based primarily on its lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Further, as part of our adoption of ASC 842, the Company also made the accounting policy elections to not capitalize short term leases (defined as a lease with a lease term that is less than 12 months) and to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes in determining the lease payments.70

The Company’s accounting policy is to record the portion of share repurchases in excess of the par value entirely in retained earnings. In fiscal 2025, the Company incurred $1.8 million in excise tax from the share repurchase that was recorded in additional paid-in capital. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the amounts within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the surrender and retirement of stock to exercise options due to net settlement stock options exercises, restricted stocks vesting, and restricted stock units vesting were $6.5 million, $21.9 million, and $28.9 million, respectively.

Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares of our stock result from dilutive common stock options and restricted stock units. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds from exercise of an option, the amount of compensation cost, if any, for future service that we have not yet recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if any, when the option is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.The dilutive effect of stock options in the above table excludes all options for which the aggregate exercise proceeds exceeded the average market price for the period. The number of potentially dilutive option shares excluded from the calculation was 3.8 million, 3.9 million, and 4.5 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.Note 10. Share-based Compensation and Other Benefit Plans:The cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period and is net of estimated forfeitures. Stock option exercises and stock awards are satisfied through the issuance of new shares.Equity incentive plan: The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the Plans), provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and stock appreciation rights. There were 36.2 million shares of common stock authorized for grant under the Plans. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for awards under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan is 9,936,808 shares. At June 30, 2025, there were 6.8 million shares of common stock available for grant under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. The maximum term of incentive options granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan is ten years. The Plans are administered 74
Table of Contentsby the Board of Directors and its Executive Compensation Committee, which determine the persons who are to receive awards under the Plans, the number of shares subject to each award and the term and exercise price of each award. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards as of June 30, 2025 under the Plans were 9.5 million.The fair values of options granted under the Plans were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used:​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended June 30, ​​    2025​2024​2023​Dividend yield​0.45%0.41%0.34%Expected volatility​32-36%30-37%30-36%Risk-free interest rates​3.5-4.4%3.8-4.8%2.8-4.4%Expected lives (years)​4.6​4.4​4.7​​The dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical annual cash dividend divided by the market value of the Company’s common stock. The expected annualized volatility is based on the Company’s historical stock price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option granted.

The valuation allowance as of June 30, 2025 was $33.8 million compared to $19.3 million in the prior year.As of June 30, 2025, we had a $33.8 million valuation allowance, of which $13.1 million is from outside basis differences, with the remainder relating to certain foreign and state tax net operating loss and state credit carryforwards. The Company believes it is more likely than not that these tax carryovers will not be realized.As of June 30, 2025, the Company has federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.4 million and state operating loss carryforwards of $127.2 million from its previous acquisitions, which are not limited under IRC Section 382. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $116.3 million. Some of the net operating loss carryforwards expire between fiscal 2026 and 2036. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period but the Company expects to be fully utilize these attributes by June 30, 2032. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $10.5 million, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, related to the net operating loss carryovers. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $4.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards expire between 2028 and 2040. The majority of the state credit carryforwards have no expiry date. The state credit carryforwards that have expiry dates have a full valuation allowance. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $5.1 million, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, related to the tax credit carryovers.As of June 30, 2025, the Company has approximately $179 million of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $73 million of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested and the Company expects to be able to repatriate earnings on a tax neutral basis. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $106 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of June 30, 2025 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple entities as well as the complexities of laws and regulations by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. A deferred tax liability will be recognized if the Company can no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings.79
Table of ContentsWe continue to analyze our global working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if the non-U.S. subsidiaries distribute cash to the U.S. parent, which include local country withholding tax and potential U.S. state taxation. The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​Year Ended June 30, ​    2025    2024    2023Beginning balance​$ 5,278​$ 5,291​$ 5,302Decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for prior year positions​  (1,950)    —​  —FX impact​​ 1​​ (13)​​ (11)Ending balances​$ 3,329​$ 5,278​$ 5,291​Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2025 are potential benefits of $3.3 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. The Company had $0.2 million of accrued interest and penalties as of June 30, 2025. The amount recorded for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in accrued interest and penalties. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and certain state tax jurisdictions, and several jurisdictions outside the U.S. The Company’s federal returns are subject to tax assessment for 2020 and subsequent years. State and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states.Note 13.

Restructurings:Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Actions:During the fourth quarter, management engaged in a series of restructuring activities to optimize components of our global manufacturing processes. These activities included adjusting manufacturing locations and protocols of certain products to better align with geographical and customer demand. Associated with these manufacturing changes, the Company incurred asset impairments of $11.5 million. Additionally, the Company pursued strategic divestiture of the Exosome Diagnostics business. The Company is expecting to incur costs related to these actions through fiscal 2026, which will be recorded when specified criteria are met. As part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment were classified as held-for-sale as of May 31, 2025, including $4.5 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a result of an impairment test performed over the disposal group during fiscal 2025, a cumulative impairment charge of $83.1 million which includes the allocated goodwill, was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2025.83

These actions impacted approximately 4% of our global workforce. These actions continued through the end of fiscal 2025 as we incurred charges relating to the condensing of certain distribution centers and optimizing efficiency. As part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023, including $1.4 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a result of an impairment test performed over the disposal group during fiscal 2024, a cumulative impairment charge of $22.0 million which includes the allocated goodwill, was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2024. There was a recovery related to the disposal group during fiscal 2025 of $2.6 million. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a buyer to purchase the remaining inventory for approximately $8 million. As part of the arrangement, the Company and the buyer entered into a promissory note that will mature in February 2027 and agrees that the buyer shall pay in quarterly installments. As of June 30, 2025, the fair value of the note receivable was approximately $5.3 million and is included within Other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2025, the assets remaining within the disposal group primarily include the land and building of $4.7 million, which is net of expected selling costs. These assets are actively marketed at a fair value based on market conditions such that the held-for-sale criterion are still met.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures​As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). The evaluation was based upon reports and certifications provided by a number of executives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:(i)Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;(ii)Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and(iii)Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment and those criteria, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.The attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting issued by KPMG LLP appears in Item 8 of this report.(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.88
