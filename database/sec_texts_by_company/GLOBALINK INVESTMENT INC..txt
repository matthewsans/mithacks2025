EXPLANATORY
NOTE
Globalink
Investment Inc. (the “Company,” “we”, “our” or “us”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 (this
“Amendment”) to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, originally filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2025 (the “Original Filing,” as amended by this Amendment, the
“Annual Report”), as a comprehensive amendment to amend and restate its financial statements and related footnote disclosures
included in the Original Filing as of and for the period ended December 31, 2024.
Background
of Restatement
On
December 3, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “December 2024 Extension Meeting”). In connection
with the December 2024 Extension Meeting, as set forth in the Company’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 6, 2024,
the holders of 2,285,056 shares of the Company’s common stock properly exercised their right to redeem (the “December 2024
Extension Redeeming Stockholders”) such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s trust account. On December
11, 2024, a redemption payment was made by Continental Stock & Transfer Company (“CST”), as trustee of the trust account,
to the December 2024 Extension Redeeming Stockholders at a rate of $11.76793003 per share (“the “December 2024 Redemption
Payment”). It was later determined that the Company did not withdrawal all of the interest from the trust account that was permitted
to withdrawal to cover income and franchise taxes and, therefore, the December 2024 Redemption Payment should have been approximately
$11.52149928 per share. This meant that the December 2024 Extension Redeeming Stockholders were overpaid in the amount of $0.24643075
per share (the “December 2024 Extension Overpayment Amount”).
As
a result of the December 2024 Extension Overpayment Amount, the Company lacked the available amounts of interest in the trust account
to fully cover the permitted withdrawals for income tax and franchise tax liabilities. When calculating the common stock subject to possible
redemption in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, considering permitted withdrawals for income and franchise taxes the
per share redemption price was below the $10.15 (“principal per share price”) reported at the initial public offering. As
a result, within the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company adjusted the common stock subject to possible redemption
to reflect the principal per share price reported at the initial public offering. After further review, management determined that the
principal per share price that was reported within the Form 10-K as of December 31, 2024, did not consider additional extension payments
that were placed into the trust account by the Company and interest earned that was included in the December 2024 Extension Overpayment
Amount for non-redeeming stockholders, which has been now considered within this Form
10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2024 (see note 2 of the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2024, included in the Annual Report).
The
financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for this period is superseded by the information in this Amendment,
and the financial statements and related financial information contained in the Original Filing should no longer be relied upon. On [
], the Company filed a report on Form 8-K disclosing the non-reliance on the financial statements included in the Original Filing.
Internal
Control Considerations
In
connection with the restatement, management has re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s management has concluded that, in light of
the errors described above, and the filing of this Amendment, a material weakness exists in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting related to the Company’s calculating and reporting of the common stock subject to possible redemption and the
review of the redemption price per share. Management plans to further review and consult with legal and other professionals to ensure
an understanding of the obligations that exist within the agreements related to the common stock subject to possible redemption. Additionally,
management will further review the common stock redemption prior to any and all filings to ensure its accuracy and that it properly represents
the obligations of the Company. For a discussion of management’s consideration of disclosure controls and procedures, internal
controls over financial reporting, and the material weaknesses identified, see Part I, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”
of this Amendment.
Except
as described above, this Amendment does not amend, update or change any other items or disclosures contained in the Original Filing,
and, accordingly, this Amendment does not reflect or purport to reflect any information or events occurring after the date of the Original
Filing or modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction
with the Original Filing and the Company’s other filings with the SEC. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Original Filing.
Items
Amended In This Amendment
For
the convenience of the reader, this Amendment sets forth the Original Filing in its entirety, as amended to reflect the restatement and
related revisions. No attempt has been made in this Amendment to update other disclosures presented in the Original Filing, except as
required to reflect the effects of the restatement. The following items have been amended as a result of the restatement:
●
Part
I – Item 1. Business.
●
Part
I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.
●
Part
II – Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
●
Part
IV – Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.
Except
for the foregoing, this Annual Report speaks as of the date of the Original Filing, does not reflect events that may have occurred subsequent
to the Original Filing, and does not modify or update in any way disclosures made in the Original Filing. This Annual Report should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s other filings with the SEC.
As
required by Rule 12b-15 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), new certifications by our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer are being filed as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2 to this Annual Report.

PART
I
ITEM
1. BUSINESS
Overview
We
are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 24, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses,
which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination
target in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to search globally, with a focus on North America, Europe, Southeast
Asia, and Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau), for target companies within the medical technology and green energy sectors. We
shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong
Kong and Macau). We intend to focus specifically on companies that are positioned to benefit directly from the technological development
in the medical industry and green energy sectors. While our efforts to identify a target were not limited to any particular segment or
geography, our search was focused on the medical technology and green energy sectors.
On
January 30, 2024, we entered into a merger agreement (as amended and restated on May 20, 2024 and as may be further amended, restated
or supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with Alps Holdco (as defined below). See “—
Merger Agreement with Alps Life Sciences Inc.”
Our
Initial Public Offering
On
December 9, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share
of common stock, $0.001 par value, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial
business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of common stock at
a price of $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement of 517,500 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit,
generating total proceeds of $5,175,000.
On
December 9, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional
units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) occurred on December 13, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 1,500,000
Over-Allotment Units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $15,000,000. On December 13, 2021, simultaneously
with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the private sale of an additional 52,500 private units, generating gross proceeds
of $525,000. The private units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions
did not involve a public offering.
A
total of $116,725,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units) and the private placements
on December 9, 2021 and December 13, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders
(the “Trust Account”).
Following
the closing of the IPO (including Over-Allotment Units), $116,725,000 ($10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units
in the IPO, the Over-Allotment Units, and the private units was placed in the Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company’s
public stockholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (“Continental”), acting as trustee and
has been held in cash, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust
Account. The money held in the Trust Account, if invested, may only be invested in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a) (16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”)
having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.

Developments
since the IPO
On
March 6, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”) to amend the Company’s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, allowing the Company to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a

and one or more businesses, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase
100% of the Company’s outstanding public shares of common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company’s IPO (the
“Termination Date”) by up to two (2) three-months extensions, followed by three (3) one-month extensions, to December 9,
2023 (each of which we refer to as an “Extension”, and such later date, the “Extended Deadline”). To obtain each

(Ming Hang) Chong’s departure.
Through

the approval of the proposals presented at the special meeting held on November 28, 2023, holders of 2,180,738 shares of the Company’s
common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.82 per share, for an aggregate of approximately
$23.60 million.
Through
a total of twelve elections from December 2023 to December 2024, Globalink elected to extend the Termination Date to December 9, 2024
and deposited an aggregate of $0.72 million into the Trust Account for its public stockholders. Globalink elected all of the twelve

On
December 3, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of

Merger
Agreement with Alps Life Sciences Inc
On
January 30, 2024, a merger agreement (as amended and restated on May 20, 2024 and as may be further amended, restated or supplemented
from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) was entered into by and among Globalink, GL Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time of the Acquisition Merger (as defined below) (the “Effective
Time”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Parent Representative” or the “Sponsor”),
Alps Global Holding Pubco, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“PubCo”), Alps Biosciences Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub”), Alps Life Sciences Inc, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Alps
Holdco”) and Dr. Tham Seng Kong, an individual, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time for the
shareholders of Alps Holdco as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
(the “Seller Representative”).
Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination between Globalink and Alps Holdco will be effected in two steps: (i) subject
to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Globalink, Globalink will be merged with and into PubCo,
with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity (the “Redomestication Merger”); and (ii) Merger Sub will merge
with and into Alps Holdco, resulting in Alps Holdco remaining as the surviving entity and being a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (the
“Acquisition Merger”). PubCo after the Business Combination is referred to as the “Combined Company.” The Redomestication
Merger and the Acquisition Merger are collectively referred to as the “Business Combination.”
6
As
a result of and upon the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
all of the outstanding shares of Alps Holdco will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive PubCo ordinary shares equal to the
Conversion Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The aggregate consideration for the Business Combination is $1.6 billion, payable
at the Closing in the form of newly issued PubCo ordinary shares, at $10.00 per share, of $0.0001 par value each (the “Merger
Consideration Shares”). The Merger Consideration Shares will be allocated pro rata with each shareholder of Alps Holdco receiving
a number of PubCo ordinary shares determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
On March 6, 2025, Globalink,
Alps Holdco, Parent Representative and Seller Representative, entered into a First Amendment to
the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which, parties agreed to:
●remove
the earn-out provision from the Merger Agreement; and
●remove

of and is approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Unless
otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below are defined in the Merger Agreement.
Merger
Consideration
The
aggregate consideration to be paid by Globalink to Alps Holdco shareholders in the form of PubCo ordinary shares at the Closing will
be equal to $1.6 billion, determined based on an enterprise value of Alps Holdco (the “Merger Consideration” and the shares
“the Merger Consideration Shares”).
Conversion
of Alps Holdco Ordinary Shares
Each
ordinary share of Alps Holdco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such ordinary shares of
Alps Holdco held in treasury, which will be cancelled, and any dissenting shares) shall be converted into the right to receive a number
of PubCo ordinary shares equal to $1.6 billion divided by the number of fully-diluted ordinary shares of Alps Holdco divided by $10.00

shares of PubCo (“PIPE Shares”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $40,200,000,
in a private placement. As of the date of this report, Globalink, Alps Holdco and PubCo are negotiating termination agreements with
two investors who entered into the subscription agreements to purchase $40 million worth of PIPE Shares, dated June 4, 2024 and June
5, 2024, respectively, and the parties expect to enter into such termination agreements prior to the closing of the initial Business
Combination.
Subsequent to December 31, 2024, Globalink, Alps Holdco and PubCo entered into additional subscription agreements
(together with previous executed subscription agreement on August 27, 2024, the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with several
investors on substantially same terms (together with previous investor who entered into a subscription agreement dated August 27, 2024,
the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo has agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, and
the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase certain number of ordinary shares of PubCo at a purchase price of $10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $3,279,911, in a private placement (the “PIPE Investment”). As of the date of

by PubCo’s escrow agent, and held in an escrow account on behalf of PubCo.
The purpose of the PIPE Investment is to raise additional capital for use by PubCo following the closing of the Business
Combination (the “Closing”). The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations and warranties of each of
Globalink, Alps Holdco, PubCo and the PIPE Investors, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Business
Combination. Under the terms of the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is obligated to file a registration statement to register for

efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after the filing there of.

Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the Closing, and effective as of the Closing, certain Alps Holdco Shareholders, the Parent Representative

consequences of ownership of the Lock-Up Shares or otherwise, publicly disclose the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition,
or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, or engage in any Short Sales (as defined in the Lock-up Agreement)

Shares, the 1st day of the 7th month from the Closing until the date that is nine (9) months after the date of
the Closing, (y) with respect to seventy percent (70%) of the Lock-Up Shares, the 1st day of the 10th month from

Shares, the 1st day of the 13th month from the Closing until the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date
of the Closing, or (ii) if sooner, the date after the Closing on which Globalink consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or
other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of Globalink’s stockholders having the right to

Escrow
Agreement
The
parties agreed that at or prior to the Closing, PubCo, Globalink and Continental, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) will
enter into the Escrow Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PubCo and Alps
Holdco, pursuant to which PubCo shall issue to the Escrow Agent a number of PubCo ordinary shares (with each share valued at $10.00)
equal to five percent (5%) of One Point Six Billion Dollars ($1,600,000,000), together with any equity securities paid as dividends or
distributions with respect to the Escrow Shares and along with any other dividends, distributions or other income on the Escrow Shares
(collectively, “Escrow Property”). The Escrow Property will be held in a segregated escrow account for a period of six (6)
months after the Closing Date (“Escrow Expiry Date”) and will serve as the sole and exclusive remedy and payment for indemnification
obligations (other than fraud claims), if any, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Property will not be subject to indemnification
claims to the extent made after the Escrow Expiry Date; provided, however, with respect to any indemnification claim made on or prior
to the Escrow Expiry Date that remains unresolved at the time of the Escrow Expiry Date, all or a portion of the Escrow Property reasonably
necessary to satisfy such unresolved claim will remain in the Escrow Account until such claim is resolved. After the Escrow Expiry Date,
any remaining Escrow Property not required to satisfy pending or unresolved indemnification claims will be distributed pro rata to the
Alps Holdco Shareholders. Once all pending claims are resolved, any remaining Escrow Property will also be distributed pro rata to the
Alps Holdco Shareholders. The Alps Holdco Shareholders will remain liable for any indemnification claims made after the Escrow Expiry
Date. Except for fraud claims, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnification payments shall not exceed the amount of the Escrow Property
in the Escrow Account at such time. As such, assuming that all of the Escrow Property is distributed to the Alps Holdco Shareholders
after the Escrow Expiry Date, other than fraud claims, the maximum amount of indemnification payments would be zero given there would
no longer be any Escrow Property in the Escrow Account at such time. In such event, the Alps Holdco Shareholders would not have any indemnification
liability in practice after the Escrow Expiry Date other than with respect to fraud claims.

of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, to accountants and business brokers will allow
us to generate an attractive transaction for our stockholders.
The
past performance of our management team, or advisor or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect
to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business
combination. No member of our management team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past.
You should not rely on the historical record of our management team’s or advisor’s or their respective affiliates’
performance as indicative of our future performance.
Corporate
Information
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain
exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”
including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may
be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of
the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed
to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the prior December 31, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with
it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally,
we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take
advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of common
stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior December 31, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million
during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of
the prior December 31.
Our
executive offices are located at 200 Continental Drive, Suite 401, Newark, Delaware 19713, and our telephone number is +6012 405 0015.
Business
Strategy
While
we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic location, we intend to focus our search on industries
that complement our management team’s background and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire
a business, focusing on technology industries, specifically within the medical technology and green energy sectors. Our objective is
to focus on middle market and emerging growth businesses operating with a total enterprise value from $80 million to $2 billion, which
may be located throughout the world.
16
We
believe that acquiring a leading high-growth technology company or assets in the technology industry such as medical and green energy
technologies will provide a platform to fund consolidation and fuel growth for our company. There is no restriction in the geographic
location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Asia (excluding
China, Hong Kong and Macau), as the geographical focus. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with
its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
We
believe that there is a large pool of quality initial business combination targets looking for exit opportunities with an increasing
number of private equity and venture capital activities in the certain regions, which provides us opportunities given what we believe
are the limited exit options for mid-market companies in the region. Also, we believe that the medical technology and green energy industries
represent a particularly attractive deal sourcing environment that will allow us to leverage our team’s skill sets and experience
to identify an initial business combination which can potentially serve as a strong platform for future add-on acquisitions. Our investment
thesis is supported by what we believe are the following trends in our target sectors:
Strong
Growth in Private Equity: Strong levels of venture capital activity in the technology sector support our pursuit of an initial business
combination.
Operator-Led
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”) outperform their Sectors: According to an article published by McKinsey
& Company on September 23, 2020, SPACs that are led by executives with past C-Suite experience tend to outperform other SPACs (by
about 40%) and their industry peers (by about 10%) after at least 12 months of publicly available trading data.
On
January 30, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Alps Holdco. For details, see “Item 1. Business—Merger Agreement
with Life Sciences Inc.”
Competitive
Advantages
We
intend to capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of a target company:
Leadership
of an Experienced Management Team. Our experienced management team and Board of Directors have many years of combined work experience
in investments, technology consulting industries, financial institutions and working with regulatory authorities. These years of experience
have allowed us to gain not only extensive and deep expertise in our fields, but also vast networks of influential thought leaders and
performing companies in our target industries and regions. We believe this positions us as a strategic player, and as an attractive alternative,
for the many companies in our focus industries and regions that seek to tap the equity capital markets, helping us find attractive opportunities
that maximize value to our stockholders.
Established
Deal Sourcing Network. We believe the strong track record of our management team and financial advisor will provide access to quality
initial business combination partners. In addition, through our management team and financial advisor, we believe we have contacts and
sources from which to generate acquisition opportunities and possibly seek complementary follow-on business arrangements. These contacts
and sources include those in government, private and public companies, private equity and venture capital funds, investment bankers,
attorneys and accountants.
Status
as a Publicly Listed Acquisition Company. We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective
target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering
process. We believe that some target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater
certainty of execution, than the traditional initial public offering process. During an initial public offering, there are typically
underwriting fees and marketing expenses, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business
combination is approved by our stockholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively
become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well
as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe our target business would have greater
access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with our stockholders’ interests
than it would as a private company.
Acquisition
Criteria
Consistent
with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective
target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into
our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
Target
Size. Consistent with our investment thesis as described above, we plan to target businesses with total enterprise values ranging
from $80 million to $2 billion in the technology industries, specifically within the medical technology and green energy sectors.
Businesses
with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant
revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense
reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage.
17
Businesses
with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate
strong, stable, and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and
definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow to enhance
stockholder value.
Strong
Management. We will seek companies with strong management teams already in place. We will spend significant time assessing a company’s
leadership and human fabric and maximizing its efficiency over time.
Benefit
from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively
utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
Appropriate
Valuations and Upside Potential. We intend to apply rigorous, criteria-based, disciplined, and valuation-centric metrics. We intend
to acquire a target on terms that we believe provide significant upside potential while seeking to limit risk to our investors.
High-Growth
Markets. Businesses in higher-growth sub-sectors and geographies in selected developed and emerging international markets.
Leverage
Our Management Team Expertise. Targets that can particularly capitalize on our management team’s expertise acquired through
decades of hands-on experience, deep geographic insights, long standing personal relationships, wide network, and strategic deal-making
experience.
The
parameters mentioned above are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business
combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that
our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business
that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our
stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form
of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.
On
December 23, 2024, PubCo filed a registration statement on Form F-4 with the SEC (File No. 333-284035), relating to the Business Combination.
Status
as a Public Company
We
believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we
offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In
this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their equity interests, shares and/or shares of stock in the target
business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of
the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will
find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a
typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may
not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore,
once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public
offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could
delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and
an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by
augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While
we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential
target businesses may have a negative view of us since we are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty
relating to our ability to obtain stockholders approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our
Trust Account in connection therewith.
Effecting
an Initial Business Combination
We
will currently have up until April 9, 2025 to complete our business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to
consummate our initial business combination within the deadline, we may, by resolution of our Board of Directors if requested by our
sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis until June 9, 2025, subject to our sponsor
depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set out below.
18
Pursuant
to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended, and the Trust Agreement, as amended, in order
for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees,
upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account $60,000 for each monthly extension,
on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable
deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days
prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether
or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to
extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination
within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our
outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate.
However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of
our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the rights and warrants included in the private units will
expire and will be worthless.
We
will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose, at which stockholders
may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote or vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their
pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with
the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount
equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject
to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination
or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on
a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek
stockholder approval. Any tender offer documents used in connection with a business combination will contain substantially the same financial
and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
The
per public share redemption or conversion price distributed to stockholders who elected to redeem our shares of common stock in connection
with the special meeting held on December 3, 2024 was $11.77. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts in the future as
a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
Pursuant
to the rules of the Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market
value of at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income
earned on the Trust Account) at the time at which we enter into a definitive business combination agreement, which we refer to as the
80% test. Therefore, the fair market value of the target business will be calculated prior to any conversions of our shares in connection
with a business combination. While the fair market value of the target business must satisfy the 80% test, the consideration we pay the
owners of the target business may be a combination of cash (whether cash from the Trust Account or cash from a debt or equity financing
transaction that closes concurrently with the business combination) or our equity securities. The exact nature and amount of consideration
would be determined based on negotiations with the target business, although we will attempt to primarily use our equity as transaction
consideration. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses,
we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will also
obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm before consummating a business combination with an entity affiliated
with any of our officers, directors or insiders. As we are no longer listed on the Nasdaq, we will not be required to satisfy the 80%
test.
We
anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which we will own or acquire 100% of
the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such
that the post-transaction company owns less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction
company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company
owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority
interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction.
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance
of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority
of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target
business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned
or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test.
As
more fully discussed in ITEM 10 “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest,” if
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity
to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination
opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our officers and directors currently
have certain relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
19
We
are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period until we are no longer an
“emerging growth company.”
We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of
the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed
to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million
as of the prior December 31, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior
three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Stockholder
Approval of Business Combination
In
connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at
a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders (but not our insiders, officers or directors) may seek to convert their
shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote or vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us
by means of a tender offer (and therefore avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a
tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some
pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination
or whether we will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and
will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise
require us to seek stockholder approval. We anticipate that our business combination could be completed by way of a merger, share exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction. Stockholder approval will not be required
under Delaware law if the business combination is structured as an acquisition of assets of the target company, a share exchange with
target company stockholders or a purchase of stock of the target company. A
merger of our company into a target company would require stockholder approval under Delaware law. A merger of a target company into
our company would not require stockholder approval unless the merger results in a change to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
or if the shares issued in connection with the merger exceed 20% of our outstanding shares prior to the merger. A merger of a target
company with a subsidiary of our company would not require stockholder approval unless the merger results in a change in our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation.
If
a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will provide
our stockholders with an opportunity to tender their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E
of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially
the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
In
the event we allow stockholders to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules, our tender offer will remain open for at least
20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business
combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase,
we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
20
If,
however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval
for business or other legal reasons, we will:
●
permit
stockholders to convert their shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which
regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
●
file
proxy materials with the SEC.
In
the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection
therewith, provide stockholders with the conversion rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If
we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, we will complete our initial
business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination.
A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company
representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting.
Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have
agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in
open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination, though our sponsor, officers and directors
do not intend to acquire any shares of our common stock in the open market. For purposes
of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of
our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, we would not need any of the public shares sold in connection
with our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination
approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders,
make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public
shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date
for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
Our
insiders, including our officers and directors, have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed
business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (3) not to sell any shares
of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
21
Conversion
Rights
At
any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed business
combination, will be entitled to demand that his, her or its shares of common stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount
then in the Trust Account ($11.62 per share as of December 31, 2024), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the
opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote)
for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable.
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or hers or any other person with whom he or she is acting in
concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking conversion
rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to
vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all shares of common stock owned by him or her, or his or her affiliates.
We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed
business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant
premium to the then current market price. By not allowing a stockholder to convert more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in
the IPO, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which
is favored by our other public stockholders.
None
of our insiders will have the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed
initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’
rights or pre-business combination activity with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether
acquired prior to the IPO or purchased by them in the IPO or in the aftermarket.
We
may also require public stockholders who wish to convert, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,”
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their
shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at
the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any
proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly,
a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver
his or her shares if he or she wishes to seek to exercise his or her conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required
to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder
would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights.
There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not
to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their
shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise conversion rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver
shares to exercise conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require
stockholders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is
not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
The
foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in
connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’
vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the
proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her conversion rights. After the business combination was approved,
the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result,
the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he or she could
monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he or she could sell his
or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion
rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing”
right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate.
22
The
requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his or her shares
is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any
request to convert such shares once made may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore,
if a holder of a public share delivered his or her certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides
prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer
agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
If
the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their
conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case,
we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
Liquidation
if No Business Combination
If
we do not complete a business combination on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a business combination
is extended as described herein), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds
held in the Trust Account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the
right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following
such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in
the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other
applicable law. At such time, the rights will expire, and holders of the rights will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect
to such rights, and the rights will be worthless.
Under
the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent
of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders
upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within
the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures
set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims
against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period
during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made
to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro
rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the
third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares
in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution
under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of
three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible
following the Extended Deadline and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could
potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders
may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because
we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending
claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company,
rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only
likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
23
We
will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after the IPO) and any prospective target businesses
enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any
monies held in the Trust Account. The underwriters in the IPO have execute such a waiver agreement. As a result, the claims that could
be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust.
We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability
to distribute the funds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers
and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute
such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain,
on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples
of instances where we may engage a third-party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third-party consultant who
cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements,
or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute
a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide
the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of
funds in the Trust Account to the lesser of (i) $10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust
Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.15 per public share due to reductions in the value of
the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party who executed
a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters
of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed
to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations, as we have not required our sponsor to retain any assets
to provide for its indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that our sponsor will be able to satisfy
any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our sponsor will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only
have liability to us. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation,
claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account
could be less than approximately $11.62 per share, based on the balance of our Trust Account as of December 31, 2024, due to claims
or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests,
an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the Trust Account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, (subject
to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).
If
we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion
of the funds held in the Trust Account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the Trust Account to begin liquidating such assets promptly
after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders
have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent
liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account. If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the
funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to
seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account,
plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes.
The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims
of public stockholders.
Our
public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial
business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock
upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the Trust Account.
If
we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held
in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims
of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the
per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $11.62 per share, based on the balance
of our Trust Account as of December 31, 2024.
If,
after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors may be viewed as having breached
its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by
paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these
reasons.
Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, As Third Amended
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended, contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the IPO
that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended, relating to stockholder’s rights or pre-business combination
activity (including the substance or timing within which we have to complete a business combination), we will provide our public stockholders
with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash,
equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account
and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in
connection with any such vote. Our insiders have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any insider shares, private shares
and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third
amended. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended, provides, among other things, that:
●
prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of
whether they vote or vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means
of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
24
●
we
will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that
would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and, assuming a quorum is present at the meeting, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting are
voted in favor of the business combination;
●
if
our initial business combination is not consummated on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete
a business combination is extended as described therein) the closing of the IPO, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute
all amounts in the Trust Account to all of our public holders of shares of common stock;
●
we
may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
●
prior
to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to
(i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
Potential
Revisions to Agreements with Insiders
Each
of our insiders has entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which each of them has agreed to do certain things relating to
us and our activities prior to a business combination. We could seek to amend these letter agreements without the approval of stockholders,
although we have no intention to do so. In particular:
●
restrictions
relating to liquidating the Trust Account if we failed to consummate a business combination in the time-frame specified above could
be amended, but only if we allowed all stockholders to redeem their shares in connection with such amendment;
●
restrictions
relating to our insiders being required to vote in favor of a business combination or against any amendments to our organizational
documents could be amended to allow our insiders to vote on a transaction as they wished;
●
the
requirement of members of the management team to remain our officer or director until the closing of a business combination could
be amended to allow persons to resign from their positions with us if, for example, the current management team was having difficulty
locating a target business and another management team had a potential target business;
●
the
restrictions on transfer of our securities could be amended to allow transfer to third parties who were not members of our original
management team;
●
the
obligation of our management team to not propose amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow them to propose
such changes to our stockholders;
●
the
obligation of insiders to not receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified in order to allow
them to receive such compensation; and
●
the
requirement to obtain a valuation for any target business affiliated with our insiders, in the event it was too expensive to do so.
As
specified above, stockholders would not be required to be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes.
Such changes could result in:
●
our
having an extended period of time to consummate a business combination (although with less in trust as a certain number of our stockholders
would certainly redeem their shares in connection with any such extension);
●
our
insiders being able to vote against a business combination or in favor of changes to our organizational documents;
●
our
operations being controlled by a new management team that our stockholders did not elect to invest with;
●
our
insiders receiving compensation in connection with a business combination; and
●
our
insiders closing a transaction with one of their affiliates without receiving an independent valuation of such business.
We
will not agree to any such changes unless we believe that such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders (for example, if
we believe such a modification is necessary to complete a business combination). Each of our officers and directors has fiduciary obligations
to us requiring that he or she act in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.
Competition
In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective
similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial
resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing the net proceeds of the IPO, our ability to
compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
25
The
following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
●
our
obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion
of a transaction;
●
our
obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial
business combination;
●
our
obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to the underwriters upon consummation of our initial business combination;
●
our
obligation to either repay working capital loans or extension loans that may be made to us by our insiders or their affiliates;
●
our
obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any units (and
underlying securities) issued to our insiders or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans or extension loans; and
●
the
impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on
developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Any
of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management
believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive
advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial business combination
with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
If
we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the
target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
Facilities
We
currently maintain our principal executive offices at 200 Continental Drive, Suite 401, Newark, Delaware 19713. The rent for this space
is $115 per month. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers,
adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We
have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to
devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based
on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company
is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial business combination with has been located, management
will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend
more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers
to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the
consummation of our initial business combination.
RISK
FACTORS SUMMARY
An
investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in
the section entitled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and
you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
●
We
are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our
ability to achieve our business objective.
●
If
we determine to amend certain agreements made by our management team, many of the disclosures contained in the IPO prospectus regarding
those agreements would no longer apply.
●
We
may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely
affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.
●
Globalink
may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may
be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the United States (CFIUS), or ultimately prohibited.
26
●
Reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders or any of their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf,
such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations, could reduce the funds available to us
to consummate a business combination. In addition, an indemnification claim by one or more of our officers and directors in the event
that any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director could also reduce the funds available to us outside of the
Trust Account.
●
Our
directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds
in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.
●
If,
after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary
bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members
of our Board of Directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members
of our Board of Directors and us to claims of punitive damages.
●
As
the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there
may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result
in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.
●
If
our insiders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock
and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to affect our initial business combination.
●
Changes
in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate
and complete an initial business combination.
●
Our
ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the
efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize
any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.
●
Our
insiders and their affiliates may be owed reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses which may cause them to have conflicts of interest
in determining whether a particular business combination is most advantageous.
●
We
may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated
with our executive officers, directors or insiders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.
●
The
shares beneficially owned by our insiders, including our officers and directors, will not participate in a redemption and, therefore,
our insiders may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business
combination.
●
Our
management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance
that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to
profitably operate such business.
●
The
value of the insider shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the
nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share.
●
There
is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity
and price of our securities.
●
Our
insiders paid an aggregate of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share, for the insider shares, and, accordingly, you will experience
immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our shares of common stock.
●
If
we invest the funds held in the Trust Account in securities, they could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the
value of the assets held in trust and the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders.
●
If
we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed
above for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the
proposed business combination is not approved.
●
We
may amend the terms of the rights or warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding rights or warrants, respectively.
●
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain
types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to
obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company’s directors, officers or other employees.
27
ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS
This
Annual Report contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements
and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report, before deciding whether to invest in our units. If any of the following
events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading
price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks
Relating to Our Business and Our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination
We
are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability
to achieve our business objective.
We
are a blank check company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until we consummate our initial business combination.
Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is
to complete our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. Even though we have entered into the Merger Agreement
with Alps Holdco, we may not be able to successfully complete our business combination with Alps Holdco. If we fail to complete our initial
business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.
We
will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would
cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.
The
Company’s public shares are subject to redemption at the time of an initial business combination. Although the Company did not
specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter currently in effect provides that consummate its initial business combination only
if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.
In connection with meetings of stockholders held by the Company on March 6, 2023, November 28, 2023 and December 3, 2024, respectively,
6,756,695, 2,180,738 and 2,285,056 public shares of the Company were redeemed at a price of $10.35 per share, $10.82 per share and $11.77
per share, respectively. These redemption events have lowered the amount of money available in our Trust Account and increased the risks
that we may not be able to consummate an initial business combination.
If
we are unable to consummate our initial business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait until our liquidation before
receiving distributions from the Trust Account.
Currently,
we have until April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein)
to consummate our initial business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate
our initial business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert their shares. Only after
the expiration of this full time period will holders of our common stock be entitled to distributions from the Trust Account if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination. Accordingly, investors’ funds may be unavailable to them until after such
date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares, potentially at a loss.
Our
public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination.
We
will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders
may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote or vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their
pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders
with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an
amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, in each case subject to the limitations
described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial business combination even
if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder
approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us,
solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the
transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval.
28
Our
public stockholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with our potential extensions.
If
we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9,
2025 if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein), we may, by resolution of our Board of Directors
if requested by our sponsor, further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to another two times by monthly
extensions, as long as our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposits
into the Trust Account $60,000 for each extension on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Our public stockholders will not
be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. As a result, we may conduct such an extension even
though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such an extension. This feature is different than the traditional special
purpose acquisition company structure, in which any extension of the company’s period to complete a combination requires a vote
of the company’s stockholders and stockholders have the right to redeem their public shares in connection with such vote.
If
we determine to amend certain agreements made by our management team, many of the disclosures contained in the IPO prospectus regarding
those agreements would no longer apply.
We
could seek to amend certain agreements with our management team disclosed in the IPO prospectus without the approval of our stockholders,
although we have no current intention to do so. For example, restrictions on our executives relating to the voting of securities owned
by them, the agreement of our management team to remain with us until the closing of a business combination, the obligation of our management
team to not propose certain changes to our organizational documents or the obligation of the management team and its affiliates to not
receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified without obtaining stockholder approval. Although
stockholders would not be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes, in no event would we be able
to modify the redemption or liquidation rights of our stockholders without permitting our stockholders the right to redeem their shares
in connection with any such change. We will not agree to any such changes unless we believe that such changes are in the best interests
of our stockholders (for example, if such a modification is necessary to complete a business combination).
If
we deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines set forth in the IPO prospectus and this Annual Report, investors in the IPO may
have rescission rights or may bring an action for damages against us or we could be subject to civil or criminal actions taken by governmental
authorities.
If
we were to elect to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines set forth in the IPO prospectus and this Annual Report, each
person who purchased units in the IPO and still held such securities upon learning of the facts relating to the deviation may seek rescission
of the purchase of the units he, she or it acquired in the IPO (under which a successful claimant has the right to receive the total
amount paid for his, her or its securities pursuant to an allegedly deficient prospectus, plus interest and less any income earned on
the securities, in exchange for surrender of the securities) or bring an action for damages against us (compensation for loss on an investment
caused by alleged material misrepresentations or omissions in the sale of a security). In such event, we could also be subject to civil
or criminal actions taken by governmental authorities. For instance, the SEC can seek injunctions under Section 20(b) of the Securities
Act if it believes a violation under the Securities Act has occurred or is imminent. The SEC can also seek civil penalties under Sections
20(d) and 24 if a party has violated the Securities Act or an injunctive action taken by the SEC or if a party willfully, in a registration
statement filed under the Securities Act, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Furthermore, Section 20 allows the SEC to refer matters
to the attorney general to bring criminal penalties against an issuer.
29
We
may issue shares of our capital stock to complete our initial business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders
and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended, currently in effect, authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock to complete
our initial business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock:
●
may
significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in the IPO;
●
may
subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded
to our shares of common stock;
●
may
cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our
ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors; and
●
may
adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.
We
may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely
affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.
Although
we have no commitments as of the date of this Annual Report to issue any notes or other debt securities, we have previously issued notes
and incurred debts, and may choose to continue incurring substantial debt to complete our business combination. However, the incurrence
of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:
●
default
and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt
obligations;
●
acceleration
of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
●
our
immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
●
our
inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
financing while the debt security is outstanding; and
●
limitations
on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution
of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We
may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market
price of our shares at that time.
In
connection with our initial business combination, we may issue shares to investors in private placement transactions (so-called PIPE
transactions) at a price which approximates the per-share amounts in our Trust Account at such time. The purpose of such issuances will
be to enable us to provide sufficient liquidity to the post-business combination entity. The price of the shares we issue may therefore
be less, and potentially significantly less, than the market price for our shares at such time.
Globalink
may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be
subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States (CFIUS), or ultimately prohibited.
Globalink’s
sponsor, GL Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, has equity holders that reside outside the United States. Globalink therefore
may be considered a “foreign person” under the regulations administered by CFIUS and will continue to be considered as such
in the future for so long as the Sponsor has the ability to exercise control over Globalink for purposes of CFIUS’s regulations.
As such, an initial business combination with a U.S. business may be subject to CFIUS review, the scope of which was expanded by the
Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (“FIRRMA”), to include certain non-passive, non-controlling investments
in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business. FIRRMA, and subsequent implementing
regulations that are now in force, also subjects certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If Globalink’s initial
business combination with a U.S. business falls within CFIUS’s jurisdiction, Globalink may determine that it is required to make
a mandatory filing or that it will submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with the initial business combination without notifying
CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay Globalink’s
initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business combination
or order Globalink to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company without first obtaining CFIUS clearance, which
may limit the attractiveness of or prevent Globalink from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that it believes
would otherwise be beneficial to Globalink and its stockholders.
30
Moreover,
the process of government review, whether by the CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy and Globalink has limited time to complete its
initial business combination. If Globalink cannot complete its initial business combination by April 9, 2025 (or by June 9, 2025 if our
time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) because the review process drags on beyond such timeframe or
because Globalink’s initial business combination is ultimately prohibited by CFIUS or another U.S. government entity, Globalink
may be required to liquidate. If Globalink liquidates, based on the Trust Account balance as of December 31, 2024, Globalink’s
public stockholders may only receive approximately $11.62 per share, and the warrants and rights will expire worthless. This will also
cause you to lose the investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through
any price appreciation in the combined company.
We
may be limited to the funds held outside of the Trust Account to fund our search for target businesses, to pay our tax obligations and
to complete our initial business combination.
Of
the net proceeds of the IPO, $967,578 is available to us initially outside the Trust Account to fund our working capital requirements.
Especially since the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full, we may not have sufficient funds available with
which to structure, negotiate or close our initial business combination. We have issued promissory notes with an aggregate value of approximately
$4.2 million to the private investor, PGM, among which $2 million is due within 60 days after the consummation of our initial business combination and the
remaining balance will be converted into ordinary shares of PubCo at the time of consummation, at
a conversion price of $10.00 per share. We expect to continue
issuing promissory notes or incurring debts as needed for working capital purposes. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from
our insiders to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our insiders are under no obligation to loan us any funds. If we are unable to
obtain the funds necessary, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and may be unable to complete our initial business
combination.
Reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders or any of their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such
as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations, could reduce the funds available to us to consummate
a business combination. In addition, an indemnification claim by one or more of our officers and directors in the event that any of them
are sued in their capacity as an officer or director could also reduce the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account.
We
may reimburse our insiders or any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our
behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of
out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided that, to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in
the Trust Account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. In addition, pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as amended and currently in effect, and under applicable Delaware law, we may
be required to indemnify our officers and directors in the event that any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director.
We have also entered into agreements with our officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided
for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law. In the event that we reimburse our insiders or any
of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses prior to the consummation of a business combination or are required to indemnify any of
our officers or directors pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Delaware law, or the indemnity agreements
that we have entered into with our officers, we would use funds available to us outside of the Trust Account for our working capital
requirements. Any reduction in the funds available to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to locate and investigate
prospective target businesses and to structure, negotiate, conduct due diligence in connection with or consummate our initial business
combination.
If
third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received
by stockholders may be less than approximately $11.62 per share, based on the balance of our Trust Account as of December 31, 2024.
Our
placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all
vendors, service providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities
with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held
in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute
such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent
inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver,
in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If
any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform
an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver
if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.
31
Examples
of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant
whose expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute
a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we
are unable to consummate an initial business combination on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete
a business combination is extended as described herein) or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business
combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within
the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than $11.62
per share, based on the balance of our Trust Account as of December 31, 2024, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter
agreement dated December 6, 2021, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party
(excluding our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i)
$10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust
Account if less than $10.15 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided
that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust
Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor
will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve
for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our
sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties,
including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
Our
directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in
the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.
In
the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per share and (ii) the actual amount per
share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.15 per share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance.
If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available
for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.15 per share.
Our
stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
If
we have not completed our initial business combination on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a
business combination is extended as described herein), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro
rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as
stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly
as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our Board of Directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of
creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against
us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more)
and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties
may seek to recover from our stockholders any amounts owed to them by us.
If,
after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our Board
of Directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our Board of Directors
and us to claims of punitive damages.
If,
after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors may be viewed as having breached
its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by
paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
32
If,
before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our
stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be
reduced.
If,
before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy
law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders.
To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders
in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.
Holders
of rights will not have redemption rights.
If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we redeem the funds held in the Trust Account,
the rights will expire, and right holders will not receive any of the amounts held in the Trust Account in exchange for such rights.
We
may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the IPO, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single
business which may have a limited number of products or services.
It
is likely we will consummate our initial business combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously
consummate our initial business combination with several target businesses. By consummating a business combination with only a single
entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not
be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which
may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly,
the prospects for our success may be:
●
solely
dependent upon the performance of a single business, or
●
dependent
upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
This
lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a
substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.
Alternatively,
if we determine to simultaneously consummate our initial business combination with several businesses and such businesses are owned by
different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous
closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business
combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect
to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated
with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the target companies in a single operating business. If
we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.
The
ability of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination
or optimize our capital structure.
If
our initial business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know
how many public stockholders may exercise conversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the Trust Account for possible payment
upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third-party financing to help fund our initial business combination. In the event that
the business combination involves the issuance of our shares of stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage
of our shares of stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity
financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business
combination available to us.
33
We
may be unable to consummate an initial business combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing,
in which case public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to
receive a pro rata share of the Trust Account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.
A
potential target may make it a closing condition to our initial business combination that we have a certain amount of cash or net
tangible assets at the time of closing. If the number of
our public stockholders electing to exercise their conversion rights has the effect of reducing the amount of money available to us
to consummate an initial business combination below such minimum amount required by the target business and we are not able to
locate an alternative source of funding, we will not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able
to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. In that case, public stockholders may have to remain
stockholders of our company and wait the full 42 months after the IPO, or until June 9, 2025, in order to be able to receive a
portion of the Trust Account, or attempt to sell their shares in the open market prior to such time, in which case they may receive
less than they would have in a liquidation of the Trust Account.
Public
stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a “group,”
will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO.
In
connection with any meeting held to approve an initial business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our insiders)
the right to have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together
with any affiliate of his or hers or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group,” will be restricted
from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO. Generally, in this context,
a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such stockholders agree to act together
for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly, if you purchase more than 15% of the
shares of common stock sold in the IPO and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights
with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of common stock or sell them in the open
market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following our initial business combination, and the market price
of our shares of common stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.
Because
of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.
We
expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including
venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established
and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors
possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in consummating our initial business combination with certain
sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage
in pursuing a business combination with certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval of our initial business
combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating our initial business combination.
We
may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and
growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.
Significant
capital is required for our initial business combination. If the net proceeds of the IPO prove to be insufficient, either because of
the size of the business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, or other reasons, we
will be required to seek additional financing. We have issued promissory notes with an aggregate value of approximately $4.2 million
to the private investor PGM, among which $2 million is due within 60 days after the consummation of
our initial business combination and the remaining balance will be converted into ordinary shares
of PubCo at the time of consummation, at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, and we may be required to issue
similar promissory notes or incur debts for our working capital needs. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at
all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we
would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target
business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations
or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development
or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection
with or after our initial business combination.
Our
insiders control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.
Our
insiders collectively beneficially own approximately 97.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with any
vote for a proposed business combination, our insiders have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them after the IPO as
well as any shares of common stock acquired in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination, and therefore will have
a significant influence on the vote.
34
Our
Board of Directors is divided into three classes and, therefore, our insiders will continue to exert control over us until the closing
of a business combination.
Our
Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of
directors being elected in each year. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at
least the consummation of the business combination. Accordingly, you may not be able to exercise your voting rights under corporate law
until after April 9, 2025 (or until after June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein).
If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” Board of Directors, fewer than half of the Board of Directors
will be considered for election and our insiders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the
outcome. Accordingly, our insiders will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of our initial business combination.
We
may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination.
Under
Section 211(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes
of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. It is
unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business
combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which requires an annual
meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,
they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
If
our insiders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and
the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to affect our initial business combination.
Our
insiders are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the insider shares at any time commencing three months prior to
the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the private units and our insiders or their
affiliates are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the private units and any units our insiders or their affiliates may
be issued upon conversion of working capital loans or extension loans made to us (and any securities underlying the private units or
units issued upon conversion of the working capital loans or extension loans) commencing on the date that we consummate our initial business
combination. The presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market
price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination
or increase the cost of consummating our initial business combination with the target business, as the stockholders of the target business
may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the
potential effect the exercise of such warrants may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.
We
may enter into agreements with consultants or financial advisers that provide for the payment of fees upon the consummation of our initial
business combination, and, therefore, such consultants or financial advisers may have conflicts of interest.
We
may enter into agreements with consultants or financial advisers that provide for the payment of fees upon the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we pay consultants or financial advisers fees that are tied to the consummation of our initial business combination,
they may have conflicts of interest when providing services to us, and their interests in such fees may influence their advice with respect
to a potential business combination. For example, if a consultant’s or financial advisor’s fee is based on the size of the
transaction, then they may be influenced to present us with larger transactions that may have lower growth opportunities or long-term
value versus smaller transactions that may have greater growth opportunities or provide greater value to our stockholders. Similarly,
consultants whose fees are based on consummation of a business combination may be influenced to present potential business combinations
to us regardless of whether they provide longer-term value for our stockholders. While we will endeavor to structure agreements with
consultants and financial advisors to minimize the possibility and extent of these conflicts of interest, we cannot assure you that we
will be able to do so and that we will not be impacted by the adverse influences they create.
If
we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may
be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.
If
we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:
●
restrictions
on the nature of our investments;
●
restrictions
on the issuance of securities; and
●
each
of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.
35
In
addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:
●
registration
as an investment company;
●
adoption
of a specific form of corporate structure; and
●
reporting,
record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.
In
order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must
ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities
do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our
total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and
complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to
buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to
be a passive investor.
We
do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held
in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a) (16)
of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, as amended, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds
to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying
and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment
company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Our IPO was not intended for persons who were seeking a return on investments
in government securities or investment securities. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to
occur of either: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a business combination; or (ii) absent a business combination,
our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do
not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject
to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have
not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination,
our public stockholders may receive only approximately $11.62 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, based on the balance
of our Trust Account as of December 31, 2024.
The
requirement that we complete our initial business combination on or before April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete
a business combination is extended as described herein) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating our initial
business combination.
We
have until April 9, 2025 (or up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) to
complete our initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business
combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business
combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete
a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.
We
may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial business combination with
and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our Board of Directors in approving a proposed business combination.
We
will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial business
combination with if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our insiders. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to
obtain an opinion. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our Board of Directors, who will determine
fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender
offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.
Resources
could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts
to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders
may receive only approximately $11.62 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, based on the balance of our Trust Account as
of December 31, 2024.
We
anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements,
disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants,
attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the
proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we
may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event will
result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire
or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only
approximately $11.62 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, based on the balance of our Trust Account as of December 31,
2024, and our rights and warrants will expire worthless.
36
Compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of
completing an initial business combination.
Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control and may require that we have such
system of internal control audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny,
civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management’s
evaluation of our system of internal control, although as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may
take advantage of an exemption to this requirement. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act regarding adequacy of their internal control. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial business combination.
If
we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional
risks that may negatively impact our operations.
We
entered into the Merger Agreement with Alps Holdco, whose main operating subsidiary is a Malaysian company focusing on the provision
of precise and preventive healthcare solutions. If we consummate our initial business combination with Alps Holdco or any other target
company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating,
agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject
to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
In
addition, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business’
home jurisdiction, including any of the following:
●
rules
and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;
●
tariffs
and trade barriers;
●
regulations
related to customs and import/export matters;
●
longer
payment cycles;
●
tax
issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;
●
currency
fluctuations and exchange controls;
●
challenges
in collecting accounts receivable;
●
cultural
and language differences;
●
employment
regulations;
●
crime,
strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and
●
deterioration
of political relations with the United States.
We
may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations may suffer.
If
we reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern
some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
In
connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business to another jurisdiction. If we
determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and
the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States.
The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business
opportunities or capital.
37
If
we effect our initial business combination with a target business located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such target
business will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
We
entered into the Merger Agreement with Alps Holdco, whose main operating subsidiary is a Malaysian company focusing on the provision
of precise and preventive healthcare solutions. If we effect our initial business combination with Alps Holdco or any other target business
located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such target business is domiciled will govern almost all of the
material agreements relating to its operations. The target business may not be able to enforce any of its material agreements in such
jurisdiction and appropriate remedies to enforce its rights under such material agreements may not be available in this new jurisdiction.
The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation
as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant
loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we consummate our initial business combination with a company located
outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some
of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United
States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States
courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws of the United
States.
Provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, and Delaware law, may inhibit a takeover
of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, contains provisions that may discourage
unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered Board
of Directors and the ability of the Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may
make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over
prevailing market prices for our securities.
We
are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions
may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over
prevailing market prices for our securities.
Because
we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles or international financial reporting standards, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business
combination with some prospective target businesses.
The
federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance
tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required
to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or
GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board or the IASB,
depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in
connection with any tender offer documents we use, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statement
requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may consummate our initial business combination with because some targets
may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
Changes
in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and
complete an initial business combination.
In
recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer
insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally
increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.
The
increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive
for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage
as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable
terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the
post-business combination’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.
38
In
addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential
liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order
to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to
any such claims (“run-off insurance”). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination
entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.
Risks
Relating to Our Management Team
Our
ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts
of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any
individuals we engage after our initial business combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.
Our
ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our
success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. None
of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs (although we expect them to devote approximately 10
hours per week to our business) and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business
activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. If our officers’ and
directors’ other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to their other business activities, it
could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business
combination. In addition, we do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected
loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.
The
role of our key personnel after our initial business combination, however, remains to be determined. Although some of our key personnel
may serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that most, if not all,
of the management of the target business will remain in place. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating
a public company, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This
could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.
Our
officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business
we may seek to consummate our initial business combination with.
We
may consummate a business combination with Alps Holdco under the Merger Agreement or with such other target business in any industry
or geographic location (excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau) we choose. Our officers and directors may not have enough experience or
sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding our initial business
combination.
Our
key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination.
These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and, as a result, may cause
them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.
Our
key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our business combination only if they are able to negotiate
employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with
the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments
and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. The personal and financial
interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.
Our
insiders and their affiliates may be owed reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses which may cause them to have conflicts of interest
in determining whether a particular business combination is most advantageous.
Our
insiders and their affiliates may incur out-of-pocket expenses in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying
and investigating possible business targets and combinations. We have no policy that would prohibit these individuals and their affiliates
from negotiating the reimbursement of such expenses by a target business. As a result, the personal and financial interests of such individuals
may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.
Members
of our management team may have affiliations with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by
us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
Members
of our management team may have affiliations with companies, including companies that are engaged in business activities similar to those
intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition
with our consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management
team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such
target business. For a more detailed description of the potential conflicts of interest of our management, see ITEM 10 “Directors,
Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest.”
39
We
may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated
with our executive officers, directors or insiders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.
In
light of the involvement of our insiders, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses
affiliated with our insiders, officers and directors. Our officers and directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities,
including, without limitation, those described under ITEM 10 “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts
of Interest.” Alps, the target business which we intend to consummate our initial business combination with under the Merger Agreement,
is not affiliated with any of our insiders, officers or directors. To the extent that we do not consummate our initial business combination
with Alps Holdco, although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would
pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in ITEM
1 “Business — Acquisition Criteria” such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent
directors (if we have any at that time), and we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination
is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more
domestic or international businesses affiliated with our insiders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result,
the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of
interest.
The
shares beneficially owned by our insiders, including our officers and directors, will not participate in a redemption and, therefore,
our insiders may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business
combination.
Our
insiders, including our sponsor, officers and directors, have waived their right to convert their insider shares and private shares in
connection with a business combination and their redemption rights with respect to their insider shares and private shares if we are
unable to consummate our initial business combination. Accordingly, these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial
business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying
and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our sponsor’s, directors’ and officers’
discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the
terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’ best interest.
If
we are unable to consummate a business combination, any loans made by our insiders, including our officers and directors, or their affiliates
would not be repaid, resulting in a potential conflict of interest in determining whether a potential transaction is in our stockholders’
best interest.
In
order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of the IPO, our insiders, including our officers and directors, or
their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. We have issued promissory notes with an aggregate value of approximately $4.2 million to the private investor,
PGM, among which $2 million is due within 60 days after the consummation of our initial business combination and the
remaining balance will be converted into ordinary shares of PubCo at the time of consummation, at
a conversion price of $10.00 per share. If we fail to consummate a business combination within
the required time period, the loans would not be repaid. Consequently, our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in
determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’
best interest.
Our
management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance
that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably
operate such business.
We
may structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns less than 100% of such interests or assets
of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we
will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed
to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial
number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling
interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior
to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger
share of the company’s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not
be able to maintain our control of the target business.
40
The
value of the insider shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal
price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share.
Our
sponsor has invested $25,000 in connection with the purchase of 2,875,000 insider shares. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share
upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 2,875,000 insider shares would have an aggregate implied value of $28,750,000.
Even if the trading price of our common stock was as low as $0.009 per share, and the private rights and private warrants were worthless,
the value of the insider shares would be equal to our sponsor’s initial investment in us. As a result, our sponsor is likely to
be able to recoup its investment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares have lost significant
value. Accordingly, our management team, which owns founder shares and/or interests in our sponsor, may have an economic incentive that
differs from that of the public stockholders to pursue and consummate an initial business combination rather than to liquidate and to
return all of the cash in the trust to the public stockholders, even if that business combination were with a riskier or less-established
target business. For the foregoing reasons, you should consider our management team’s financial incentive to complete an initial
business combination when evaluating whether to redeem your shares prior to or in connection with the initial business combination.
Risks
Relating to our Securities
Our
securities were suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq on December 17, 2024, following receipt of a delisting determination
letter from Nasdaq on December 10, 2024. This could have significant material adverse consequences on us and our securities, including
that it will negatively impact our ability to complete a Business Combination, will limit investors’ ability to make transactions
in our securities and could subject us to additional trading restrictions.
We
currently have up until April 9, 2025 (our 40-month anniversary) to complete an initial business combination. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815,
which was amended effective October 7, 2024, provides for the immediate suspension and desilting upon issuance of a listing determination
letter for failure to meet the requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule IM 5101-2(b), curtailing the ability of the Nasdaq hearings panel to
give special purpose acquisition companies more time to complete an initial business combination beyond 36 months. Nasdaq Listing Rule
IM 5101-2(b) requires a SPAC such as us to complete its initial business combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO
registration statement, which, in our case, is December 9, 2024.
As
such, following December 9, 2024 (our 36-month anniversary), we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. On December 10,
2024, we received a delisting determination letter from Nasdaq. As a result, our securities were immediately suspended from trading and
delisted from Nasdaq on December 17, 2024, following our receipt of the delisting determination letter. Our securities are currently
traded on OTC Pink.
In
addition, in connection with any initial business combination, we would be required to demonstrate compliance with the applicable exchange’s
initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing
of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time, particularly if
we are no longer listed on a stock exchange.
As
our securities have been delisted from Nasdaq, we and our securities are currently facing significant material adverse consequences,
including:
●
being
less attractive to potential business combination targets and therefore making it more difficult for us to complete an initial business
combination;
●
a
decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;
●
a
limited availability of market quotations for our securities, even if our securities were to be quoted on an over-the-counter market;
●
reduced
liquidity and demand for our securities;
●
determination
that our shares of common stock are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock
to adhere to more stringent rules and could result in a further reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market
for our securities;
●
greater
difficulty and cost at being able to satisfy any applicable stock exchange’s initial listing requirements for the post-business
combination company;
●
our
securities no longer qualifying as “covered securities” under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996
(“NSMIA”), meaning that sales of our securities would be subject to regulation in each state in which that sale occurs,
including in connection with our initial business combination, which may negatively impact our ability to consummate our initial
business combination or to otherwise issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future and could negatively
impact the ability of our security holders to trade, and result in further reduced liquidity and demand for, our securities; and
●
a
limited amount of news and analyst coverage.
Additionally,
under the Merger Agreement, one of the conditions to Closing is the listing by Nasdaq of the PubCo ordinary shares and PubCo warrants
and satisfaction of initial and continued listing requirement. As of December 17, 2024, our securities were delisted from the Nasdaq,
and we do not believe it is possible for Globalink to be able to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq
or otherwise get listed on Nasdaq again prior to the Closing. Additionally, as a result of such delisting, PubCo may face increased difficulties
and uncertainties in meeting the initial and continued listing requirement of Nasdaq, such as the requirements as to the market value
of unrestricted publicly held shares and market value of listed securities. Approval of listing by Nasdaq of the PubCo ordinary shares
and PubCo warrants, as well as the satisfaction of initial and continued listing requirements of Nasdaq are conditions to the consummation
of the Business Combination, and as of the date of this Annual Report, we still expect to PubCo to be able to satisfy such conditions,
and we do not expect to seek a waiver or amendment of these closing conditions. Nevertheless, as a result of the delisting of Globalink’s
securities by the Nasdaq, Globalink may face increased uncertainties as to its ability to successfully consummate the Business Combination.
41
If
we invest the funds held in the Trust Account in securities, they could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value
of the assets held in trust and the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders.
In
July 2023, we instructed Continental, as trustee of our Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds
held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand deposit accounts) until
the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination or liquidation. However, to the extent that funds held in our Trust Account
are invested in any securities, including U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or money market funds investing
solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, such investment could generate
a negative return. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly
yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years,
and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies
in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds
held in the Trust Account, plus any interest income, net of taxes paid or payable. Negative interest rates could reduce the value of
the assets held in trust and the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders.
We
may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock in connection with a vote of stockholders on a proposed
business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion
rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.
In
connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have
the right, regardless of whether he, she or it votes or is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we
convert his or her shares of common stock into a share of the Trust Account. We may require public stockholders seeking to convert their
shares in connection with a stockholder vote on a proposed business combination, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares
in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent
electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at
least two business days on the initial business combination (a tender of shares is always required in connection with a tender offer).
In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will
need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain
physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC,
it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short
time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide
at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder would
have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver
their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may
be unable to convert their shares.
If
we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above
for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed
business combination is not approved.
If
we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above
for conversion and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering
public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their
securities after the failed business combination until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of
common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders
that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.
42
Holders
of warrants will not have redemption rights.
If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we redeem the funds held in the Trust Account,
the warrants will expire, and holders will not receive any of the amounts held in the Trust Account in exchange for the warrants.
We
have no obligation to net cash settle the warrants.
In
no event will we have any obligation to net cash settle the warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.
If
we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the redeemable
warrants, public holders will only be able to exercise such redeemable warrants on a “cashless basis” which would result
in a fewer number of shares being issued to the holder had such holder exercised the redeemable warrants for cash.
Except
as set forth below, if we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise
of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a “cashless
basis,” provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that a holder
will receive upon exercise of its warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised its warrant for cash. Further,
if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis and would
only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet
these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of
the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do
so, the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the private warrants may be exercisable for unregistered shares of common stock for cash even if the prospectus
relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not current and effective.
An
investor will only be able to exercise warrants if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified
or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.
No
warrants will be exercisable for cash, and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock
issuable upon such exercise have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence
of the holder of the warrants. At the time that the warrants become exercisable, we expect to continue to be listed on a national securities
exchange, which would provide an exemption from registration in every state. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. If the shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the
holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire
worthless if they cannot be sold.
Our
management’s ability to require holders of our redeemable warrants to exercise such redeemable warrants on a cashless basis will
cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the redeemable warrants than they would have received had
they been able to exercise their redeemable warrants for cash.
If
we call our warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require
any holder that wishes to exercise his warrants (including any warrants held by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees)
to do so on a “cashless basis.” If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis,
the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised
his warrants for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our
company.
We
may amend the terms of the rights or warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding rights or warrants, respectively.
Our
rights are issued in registered form under a rights agreement, and our warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement,
each between Continental, as rights or warrant agent, as applicable, and us. Each of the rights agreement and warrant agreement provides
that the terms of the rights or warrants, as applicable, may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct
any defective provision. Each of the rights agreement and warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority of the
then outstanding rights or warrants (including the private warrants), as applicable, in order to make any change that adversely affects
the interests of the registered holders of the rights or warrants, as applicable. With respect to any amendment to the terms of only
the private warrants, the warrant agreement requires the approval of the registered holders of a majority of the then outstanding private
warrants.
43
Our
outstanding rights, warrants and insider shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and make
it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.
To
the extent we issue shares of common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number
of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of the rights and exercise of the warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition
vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce
the value of the shares of common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our rights, warrants and insider shares
may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. If and to the
extent the rights are converted or the warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.
Each
of our rights agreement and warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated
by holders of our rights and holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of rights holders and warrant holders to obtain a
favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.
Each
of our rights agreement and warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us
arising out of or relating in any way to the rights agreement or the warrant agreement, as applicable, including under the Securities
Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action,
proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, these provisions of the rights agreement and the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability
or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the
sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our rights or warrants, as applicable,
shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our rights agreement or warrant agreement, as applicable.
If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the rights agreement or the warrant agreement,
as applicable, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (for purposes of this subsection, a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our rights or warrants, as
applicable, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in
the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with any action brought
in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (for purposes of this subsection, an “enforcement action”), and (y) having
service of process made upon such rights holder or warrant holder, as applicable, in any such enforcement action by service upon such
rights holder’s counsel or warrant holder’s counsel, as applicable, in the foreign action as agent for such rights holder
or warrant holder, as applicable.
These
choice-of-forum provisions may limit the ability of rights holders and warrant holders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such
holders find favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this
provision of our rights agreement or warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types
of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources
of our management and Board of Directors. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce these provisions
and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the
Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created
by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
There
are no authorities addressing the proper allocation of tax basis to the components of a unit, and therefore, investors may not appropriately
allocate such basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
No
statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, as the acquisition of one share of our common stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of
our common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant to purchase one half (1/2) of one
share of common stock, and, by purchasing a unit, you agree to adopt such treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one share of
our common stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of our common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination
and one redeemable warrant to purchase one half (1/2) of one share of common stock based on the relative fair market value of each at
the time of issuance. The price allocated should be the stockholder’s tax basis in such share or warrant, as the case may be. Any
disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of our share of our common
stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of our common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination
and one redeemable warrant to purchase one half (1/2) of one share of common stock comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the
disposition should be allocated between the common stock, the right and the redeemable warrant based on their respective relative fair
market values at the time of disposition. The foregoing treatment of the unit and a holder’s purchase price allocation are not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service, or “IRS”, or the courts. The IRS or the courts may not agree with such characterization
and investors could suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences as a result. Accordingly, we urge each prospective investor to
consult its own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a
unit).
44
Redemptions
of our common stock could give rise to dividend income (rather than gain on a sale or exchange) in certain circumstances.
In
the event that an investor’s shares of common stock are redeemed, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as sale of the shares of common stock or is instead treated as a dividend. Whether
a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the investor
(including any stock constructively owned by the investor as a result of owning rights or by attribution) relative to all of our shares
outstanding both before and after the redemption. If the redemption does not qualify for sale treatment, all or a portion of such redemption
could be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits for tax purposes (which include
earnings for the entire year of such payment, including after such payment is made). Amounts treated as dividends to non-U.S. investors
may be subject to withholding tax. Certain non-corporate U.S. investors may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation upon dividends.
The rules regarding the tax treatment of such redemptions are complex and will depend on each investor’s own circumstances. Each
investor should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption.
General
Risk Factors
We
are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure
requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more
difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
The
JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we
would be permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor’s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise
be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described above. We also intend to take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS
Act from the requirements to submit say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail
ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.
In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying
with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company.
An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until
we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
We
will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had
total annual gross revenues of at least $1.235 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the
fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of units under the IPO registration statement, (iii) the date on which we have, during
the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a
“large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Exchange Act.
Until
such time that we lose “emerging growth company” status, it is unclear if investors will find our securities less attractive
because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active
trading market for our securities and our stock prices may be more volatile and could cause our stock prices to decline.
45
After
our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and
all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or
their other legal rights.
On
January 30, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Alps, a Malaysian company. It is possible that after our initial business
combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located
outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to
enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States
courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.
After
our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue
will be derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant
extent, to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.
The
economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect
our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be
sustained in the future. If in the future such country’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected,
there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially
and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and
if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.
Exchange
rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.
In
the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent
of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value
of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.
Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business
or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a
currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target
business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.
We
are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased
both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.
We
are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection
of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable
law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased
general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from seeking a business combination target.
Moreover,
because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time
as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations
and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.
Our
search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially
adversely affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster.
Our
business could be adversely affected by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Any of such occurrences could cause severe disruption
to our daily operations and may even require a temporary closure of our operations across one or more markets. Such closures may disrupt
our business operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could also be
disrupted if our third-party service providers, business partners or acquisition targets were affected by such natural disasters. If
the disruptions posed by such events continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the
operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.
46
Cyber
incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
We
depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of
third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure,
or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary
information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection,
we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or
to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of
them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, designates the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings
that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for
disputes with our company or our company’s directors, officers or other employees.
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, provides that, unless we consent in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive
forum for any (1) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of our company to our company or our stockholders, or any claim for aiding and
abetting any such alleged breach, (3) action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer of our company arising
pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (4) action asserting
a claim against us or any director or officer of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine except for, as to each of (1)
through (4) above, any claim (a) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
within ten days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or (c) arising under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the
federal district court for the District of Delaware shall concurrently be the sole and exclusive forums. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the inclusion of such provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not be deemed to be a waiver by our stockholders
of our obligation to comply with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, and the provisions of this paragraph will not apply
to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts
of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions is filed in
a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a “foreign action”) in the name of any stockholder, such
stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State
of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”),
and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder’s
counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder.
This
choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes
with our company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to
find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more
of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of
the time and resources of our management and Board of Directors.

Dividends
We
have not paid any cash dividends on our shares of common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion
of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination will
be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of
our initial business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion
of our Board of Directors at such time. It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use
in our business operations and, accordingly, our Board of Directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.
Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited
by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

(1/10) of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder
thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at an offering
price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private
placement of 517,500 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating total proceeds of $5,175,000.
On
December 9, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment
Units occurred on December 13, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by us of 1,500,000 Over-Allotment Units at a price of $10.00 per unit
resulted in total gross proceeds of $15,000,000. On December 13, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated
the private sale of an additional 52,500 private units, generating gross proceeds of $525,000.

The
statements in the discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and
the forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties
described in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results may
differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion together
with the sections entitled “Risk Factors”,” “Business” and the audited consolidated financial statements,
including the related notes, appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. All references to year, unless otherwise noted, refers to our fiscal
year, which ends on December 31. As used in this Form 10-K, unless the context suggests otherwise, “we,” “us,”
“our,” “the Company” or “Globalink” refer to Globalink Investment Inc.
Overview
We
were formed on March 24, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target
business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses
in in North America, Europe, South East Asia, and Asia (excluding mainland China and the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions),
in the medical technology and green energy industry. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its
principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We intend to complete the business acquisition in a combination
of cash (whether cash from the Trust Account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business
combination) or our equity securities.
49
The
issuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with an initial business combination:
●
may
significantly dilute the equity interest of our investors who would not have pre-emption rights in respect of any such issuance;
●
may
subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded
to our shares of common stock;
●
could
cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things,
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors;
●
may
have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person
seeking to obtain control of us; and
●
may
adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock, rights and/or warrants.
Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in:
●
default
and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt
obligations;
●
acceleration
of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
●
our
immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
●
our
inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
financing while the debt security is outstanding;
●
using
a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general
corporate purposes;
●
limitations
on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
●
increased
vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
●
limitations
on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution
of our strategy; and
●
other
purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful.

(or twenty-one times since the IPO), and has until April 9, 2025 to complete its initial business combination.
Business
Combination
On
January 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (as amended and restated on May 20, 2024 and as may be further amended,
restated or supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among GL Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time of the Acquisition Merger (as defined below) (the “Effective
Time”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Parent Representative” or the “Sponsor”),
Alps Global Holding Pubco, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“PubCo”), Alps Biosciences Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub”), Alps Life Sciences Inc, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Alps
Holdco”) and Dr. Tham Seng Kong, an individual, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time for the
shareholders of Alps Holdco as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
(the “Seller Representative”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination between Globalink
and Alps Holdco will be effected in two steps: (i) subject to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, the Company will be merged with and into PubCo, with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity; and (ii) Merger
Sub will merge with and into Alps Holdco, resulting in Alps Holdco remaining as the surviving entity and being a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PubCo (the “Acquisition Merger”).
On March 6, 2025, Globalink,
Alps Holdco, Parent Representative and Seller Representative, entered into a First Amendment to
the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which, parties agreed to:
●remove
the earn-out provision from the Merger Agreement; and
●remove
the $5,000,001 net tangible asset requirement for (i) Globalink immediately prior to the
Closing, and (ii) PubCo upon Closing, provided that the PubCo satisfies the listing requirements
of and is approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market.
PIPE
Agreements
On
June 4, June 5 and August 27, 2024, Globalink, Alps Holdco and PubCo entered into subscription agreements with three investors on
substantially same terms, pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo has agreed to issue and sell to the investors, and the
investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase certain number of ordinary shares of PubCo (“PIPE Shares”) at a purchase
price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $40,200,000, in a private placement. As of the date of this report,
Globalink, Alps Holdco and PubCo are negotiating termination agreements with two investors who entered into the subscription
agreements to purchase $40 million worth of PIPE Shares, dated June 4, 2024 and June 5, 2024, respectively, and the parties expect
to enter into such termination agreements prior to the closing of the initial Business Combination.
Subsequent to December 31, 2024, Globalink, Alps Holdco and PubCo entered into additional subscription agreements
(together with previous executed subscription agreement on August 27, 2024, the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with several
investors on substantially same terms (together with previous investor who entered into a subscription agreement dated August 27, 2024,
the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo has agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, and
the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase certain number of ordinary shares of PubCo at a purchase price of $10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $3,279,911, in a private placement (the “PIPE Investment”). As of the date of
this report, the PIPE Investors have subscribed for an aggregate of $3,479,911 (excluding the $40 million subscription expected to be
terminated). Up to the date of this Annual Report, PIPE Investment of $879,911 was received
by PubCo’s escrow agent, and held in an escrow account on behalf of PubCo.
The
purpose of the PIPE Investment is to raise additional capital for use by PubCo following the closing of the Business Combination (the
“Closing”). The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations and warranties of each of Globalink, Alps
Holdco, PubCo and the PIPE Investors, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Business Combination. Under
the terms of the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is obligated to file a registration statement to register for the resale of all
the PIPE Shares within 60 days of the Closing (the “Filing Deadline”), and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after the filing there of.

Nasdaq
Notice
On
January 29, 2024, we submitted an application with Nasdaq for the transfer of our securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to Nasdaq
Capital Market.
On
March 6, 2024, we received Nasdaq’s approval of our transfer application and on the same date, we were notified by Nasdaq that
we regained compliance with Nasdaq’s requirement of 300 public holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
On
December 10, 2024, the Company, received a notice (the “Delisting Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of
the Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires a special purpose acquisition company
to complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. Since the Company
failed to complete its initial business combination by December 6, 2024, the Company did not comply with IM-5101-2, which triggered the
issuance of a delisting determination from Nasdaq to delist the Company’s securities. According to the Delisting Notice, the trading
of Company’s common stock, warrants, rights and units would be suspended at the opening of business on December 17, 2024, and a
Form 25-NSE would be filed with the SEC, which would remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The
Company did not appeal this ruling. The Company transferred its securities, including common stock, warrants, rights and units, to OTC
Pink for quotation under the same ticker symbols following the delisting of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq. Despite the delisting
of its securities, the Company expects to continue proceeding with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as defined
below).
Results
of Operations
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s
formation and the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”), search for a prospective initial business combination
target and negotiation for a business combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of
an initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the
proceeds derived from the IPO placed in the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders (the
“Trust Account”).
For
the year ended December 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $978,445, all of which consisted of operating expenses incurred driven by general
and administrative expenses of $1,569,710, franchise tax expense of $143,662, provision for income tax of $239,905, tax penalties and
interest of $121,630, change in fair value of warrants liabilities of $855, and $188,203 in interest expense, partially offset by interest
income on cash held in the Trust Account of $1,285,520.
For
the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net income of $1,320,324, all of which consisted of interest income on cash and investments
held in the Company’s trust account of $3,090,407 and change in fair value of warrants liabilities of $4,389, partially offset
by operating expenses incurred driven by general and administrative expenses of $991,868, provision for income tax of $529,505, accrual
of Delaware franchise taxes of $183,956, $57,255 in interest expense, penalties on income tax of $11,888.
Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern
The
registration statement on Form S-1 for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on December 6, 2021. On December 9, 2021, we consummated
our IPO of 10,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.001 par value, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10)
of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at an offering price
of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private
placement of 517,500 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating total proceeds of $5,175,000.
On
December 9, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 units in full (the “Over-Allotment
Units”), and the closing of the Over-Allotment Units occurred on December 13, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company
of 1,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $15,000,000. On December 13, 2021, simultaneously
with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the private sale of an additional 52,500 private units, generating gross proceeds
of $525,000. Since the underwriter’s over-allotment was exercised in full, the Sponsor did not forfeit any insider shares.
52
Offering
costs for the IPO and the exercise of the underwriters’ Over-allotment Option amounted to $6,887,896, consisting of $2,300,000
of underwriting fees, $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account) and $562,896 of other costs.
The $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the company consummating an initial business combination, subject
to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Following
the closing of the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units), $116,725,000 ($10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units), and the private units was placed in the Trust Account and was initially invested
in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the
Investment Company Act.
To
mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test
of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), on July 27, 2023, we instructed Continental, as trustee of our Trust Account, to
liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust
Account in cash (which may include demand deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination or
liquidation. Furthermore, such cash is held in bank accounts, which exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
For
the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $2,039,334. Net loss of $978,445 was affected by interest earned
on cash held in the Trust Account of $1,285,520 and change in fair value of warrants liabilities of $855. Changes in operating assets
and liabilities provided by $223,776 of cash for operating activities.
For
the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $1,402,478. Net income of $1,320,324 was affected by interest
earned on cash and investments held in the trust account of $3,090,407 and change in fair value of warrants liabilities of $4,389. Changes
in operating assets and liabilities provided by $371,994 of cash from operating activities.
We
had cash held in the Trust Account of $3,349,591 and $28,668,218 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income on the
balance in the Trust Account of $1,285,520 for the year ended December 31, 2024 may be used by us to pay taxes. For the year ended December
31, 2024, $433,768 was withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay for taxes.
We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole
or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses or make other acquisitions.
We
had $253,507 and $79,073 of cash held outside of the Trust Account as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We intend to use the
funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective
target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives
or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete
initial business combination.
In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or
certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the
Company completes an initial business combination, the Company will repay the working capital loans out of the proceeds of the Trust
Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the working capital loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account.
In the event that our initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account
to repay the working capital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the working capital loans. Except
for the foregoing, the terms of such working capital loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. The working capital loans would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into units of the post initial
business combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the private units. As of December 31, 2024,
there were no working capital loans outstanding.

the Promissory Notes shall be due and payable in cash within 60 days from the date of the Closing, and the remaining balance under the
Promissory Notes shall be converted into ordinary shares of PubCo at the time of Closing, at a conversion price of $10.00 per share.
If
our initial business combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are
not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion,
to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but
not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
In
connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, “Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” the Company currently has until April 9, 2025
to complete the initial business combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a business combination by this
time. If a business combination is not consummated by this date and an extension is not requested by the Sponsor, there will be a mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination
not occur, and an extension is not requested by the Sponsor, and potential subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity condition noted
above raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after April 9, 2025. The Company intends to complete
a business combination before the mandatory liquidation date.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual
obligations
We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.
55
Registration
Rights
The
holders of the insider shares, the private units and any units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans or extension
loans (and any securities underlying the private units or units issued upon conversion of the working capital loans or extension loans)
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement requiring us to register such securities for resale.
The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities.
In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent
to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act.
Underwriting
Agreement
The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discounts of $0.35 per unit, or $4,025,000 from the closing of the IPO and the Over-Allotment
Units. The deferred discounts will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if the Company
completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Right
of First Refusal
Subject
to certain conditions, we granted Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters in the IPO, for a period of 12
months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager,
with at least 30% of the economics paid to all advisors and/or underwriters), for any and all future financings undertaken until the
first (1st) anniversary of the date of the closing of an initial business combination and (b) as sole/lead left financial advisor with
respect to any and all mergers and acquisitions transactions during such period. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(E)(i), such
right of first refusal shall not have a duration of more than three years from the effective date of the registration statement for the
IPO.
Promissory
Notes
As
of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amounted owed in connection with the promissory notes was $4,445,458 and $1,757,255,
respectively, which includes interest accrued as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”)
On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are
electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our consolidated
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal control over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required
of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement
that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation
to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until
we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.

Critical
Estimates
Management’s
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. We describe
our significant accounting policies in Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included
in this report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require
that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis,
management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented
fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and
information available from outside sources, as appropriate. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Accounting
for Warrants
The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB, ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are
freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants
meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s
own shares of common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional
judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with our IPO in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 under which
the public warrants meet the criteria for equity treatment and the private warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and
must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the private warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust
the private warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until
exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was
estimated using a binomial lattice model.
In
determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants assumptions related to exercise price, market price of the public stock,
expected life and risk-free interest rate are utilized. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical
volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024.

the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, due
to the material weakness identified in the controls related to the events that led to the Company’s restatement of its financial
statements to reclassify the Company’s private warrants (complex financial instruments), our lack of compliance control of timely
tax return filings, revisions to our earnings per share, and incorrect reporting of common stock subjected to possible redemption and
redemption price per share, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that:
(1)
pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of our company,
(2)
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
and
(3)
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024. In making these assessments,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. We plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements
to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our consolidated financial statements.
Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication
among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. Additionally, the Company
is implementing deeper review of its common stock subject to possible redemption by internally reviewing to ensure amounts due to our
public stockholders is properly reported.
The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer
no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

Number,
Terms of Office and Appointment of Officers and Directors
Our
Board of Directors consists of four members, three of whom are deemed “independent” under SEC rules. Our Board of Directors
has been divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a three-year term.
The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Kian Huat Lai, expired at our special meeting of stockholders held
on November 28, 2023, in lieu of our first annual meeting of stockholders, who was re-elected as a director of the Company by the stockholders
at the meeting. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Hui Liang Wong and Hong Shien Beh, expired at our
special meeting of stockholders held on December 3, 2024, in lieu of our the second annual meeting of stockholders, who were both re-elected
as directors of the Company by the stockholders at the meeting. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Say
Leong Lim, will expire at our third annual meeting of stockholders. We may not hold an annual meeting of
stockholders until after we consummate our initial business combination.
Our
officers are appointed by the Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our Board of Directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our
bylaws provide that our directors may consist of a chairman of the Board of Directors, and that our officer may consist of chief executive
officer, president, chief financial officer, executive vice president(s), vice president(s), secretary, treasurer and such other officers
as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
60
Director
Independence
An
“independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s Board of Directors, would interfere with the
director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors had determined
that each of Hong Shien Beh, Hui Liang Wong, and Kian Huat Lai is an “independent director” as defined in the applicable
SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
We
will only enter into a business combination if it is approved by a majority of our independent directors. Additionally, we will only
enter into transactions with our officers and directors and their respective affiliates that are on terms no less favorable to us than
could be obtained from independent parties. Any related party transactions must be approved by our audit committee and a majority of
disinterested directors.
Audit
Committee
We
have established an audit committee of the Board of Directors consisting of Hong Shien Beh, Hui Liang Wong, and Kian Huat Lai, each of
whom is an independent director. Mr. Kian Huat Lai serves as chairman of the audit committee.
The
audit committee’s duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:
●
reviewing
and discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the annual audited financial statements, and
recommending to the Board of Directors whether the audited financial statements should be included in our Form 10-K;
●
discussing
with management and the independent registered public accounting firm significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in
connection with the preparation of our financial statements;
●
discussing
with management major risk assessment and risk management policies;
●
monitoring
the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm;
●
verifying
the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible
for reviewing the audit as required by law;
●
reviewing
and approving all related party transactions;
●
inquiring
and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
●
pre-approving
all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including
the fees and terms of the services to be performed;
●
appointing
or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm;
●
determining
the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements
between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing
or issuing an audit report or related work;
●
establishing
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and
●
approving
reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses.
Financial
Experts on Audit Committee
The
audit committee is, and will at all times be, composed exclusively of “independent directors” who are “financially
literate” as defined under the Nasdaq listing standards. The Nasdaq listing standards define “financially literate”
as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and
cash flow statement.
The
Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Kian Huat Lai qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined under
rules and regulations of the SEC.
Compensation
Committee
We
have established a compensation committee of the Board of Directors consisting of Hong Shien Beh, Hui Liang Wong, and Kian Huat Lai,
each of whom is an independent director. Ms. Hui Liang Wong serves as chairman of the compensation committee.
61
We
adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:
●
reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation,
evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the
remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer’s based on such evaluation;
●
reviewing
and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers and reviewing and making recommendations with respect to all
non-executive officer compensation;
●
reviewing
our executive compensation policies and plans;
●
implementing
and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;
●
assisting
management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;
●
approving
all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers
and employees;
●
producing
a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and
●
reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.
The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the SEC.
Director
Nominations
We
do not have a standing nominating committee, though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required
to do so by law. The Board of Directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly
selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. Hong Shien Beh, Hui Liang Wong, and
Kian Huat Lai will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees. As there is no standing nominating committee,
we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.
The
Board of Directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are
seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders).
Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to the Board of Directors should follow the procedures set forth in our
bylaws.
We
have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess.
In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Board of Directors considers educational background, diversity of
professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent
the best interests of our stockholders.
Director
Compensation
No
director has received and will receive cash compensation for serving on our Board of Directors.
In
November 2023, Mr. Cliff (Ming Hang) Chong transferred the 10,000 insider shares he owned to Mr. Kelvin (Zeng Yenn) Chin, our former
Chief Financial Officer.
Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
We
may not have a compensation committee in place prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Any executive compensation
matters that arise prior to the time we have a compensation committee in place will be determined by our independent directors. None
of our directors who currently serve as members of our compensation committee is, or has at any time in the past been, one of our officers
or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee
of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors. None of our executive officers currently
serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the Board of Directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers
serving on our compensation committee.
Code
of Ethics
We
have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of ethics codifies the
business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.
62
Compensation
Recovery Policy
We
have adopted a compensation recovery policy to provide for the recovery of erroneously-awarded incentive compensation, as required by
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, final SEC rules and applicable listing standards.
Conflicts
of Interest
Investors
should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest:
●
None
of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest
in allocating their time among various business activities.
●
In
the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities
which may be appropriate for presentation to our company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Thus, our
officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be
presented.
●
Our
officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities, including other blank check companies, engaged in business
activities similar to those intended to be conducted by our company.
●
Unless
we consummate our initial business combination, our officers, directors and other insiders will not receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount of available proceeds not deposited in
the trust account.
●
The
insider shares beneficially owned by our officers and directors will be released from escrow only if our initial business combination
is successfully completed. Additionally, if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time frame,
our officers and directors will not be entitled to receive any amounts held in the trust account with respect to any of their insider
shares or private units. Furthermore, GL Sponsor LLC has agreed that the private units will not be sold or transferred by it until
after we have completed our initial business combination. For the foregoing reasons, our Board of Directors may have a conflict of
interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effect our initial business
combination.
In
general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business
opportunities to a corporation if:
●
the
corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;
●
the
opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and
●
it
would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.
Accordingly,
as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business
opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our officers or directors in circumstances
where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have. In order to
minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple affiliations, our officers and directors (other than our independent
directors) have agreed to present to us for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other person or entity, any suitable opportunity
to acquire a target business, until the earlier of: (1) our consummation of an initial business combination and (2) April 9, 2025 (or
up until June 9, 2025 if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein). This agreement is, however, subject
to any pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations such officer or director may from time to time have to another entity. Accordingly,
if any of them becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has pre-existing
fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination
opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the pre-existing
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers and directors will materially undermine our ability to complete our business
combination because in most cases the affiliated companies are closely held entities controlled by the officer or director or the nature
of the affiliated company’s business is such that it is unlikely that a conflict will arise.

Each

individual listed in this table of his obligations and the presentation by each such individual of business opportunities.
(2)
Each
individual listed has a fiduciary duty with respect to each of the listed entities opposite from his or her name.
Our
insiders, including our officers and directors, have agreed to vote any shares of common stock held by them in favor of our initial business
combination. In addition, they have agreed to waive their respective rights to receive any amounts held in the trust account with respect
to their insider shares and private shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the required time frame.
If they purchase shares of common stock in the open market, however, they would be entitled to receive their pro rata share of the amounts
held in the trust account if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the required time frame, but have agreed
not to convert such shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.
All
ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed
by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval
by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested “independent” directors, or the members of our Board of Directors
who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal
counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested “independent”
directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect
to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.
To
further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated
with any of our officers, directors or other insiders, unless we have obtained (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view and (ii) the approval of a
majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time). In no event will our insiders or any of the members
of our management team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
Limitation
on Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, provides that our directors and officers
will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition,
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, provides that our directors will not
be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of
loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends,
unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as third amended and currently in effect, such
indemnification will not extend to any claims our insiders may make to us to cover any loss that they may sustain as a result of their
agreement to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered
or contracted for or products sold to us as described elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have entered into indemnity agreements with
each of our officers and directors. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.
Our
bylaws also will permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or
her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit indemnification. We will purchase directors and officers liability insurance
that protects our directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures
us against our obligations to indemnify the directors and officers.
These
provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions
also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action,
if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected
to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these provisions. We believe
that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced directors
and officers.
64
Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Executive
Officer and Director Compensation
No
executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us.
Under
a certain administrative services agreement with GL Sponsor LLC, we paid to GL Sponsor LLC a fee of $10,000 per month for providing us
with office space and certain office and secretarial services from the closing of our IPO to September 30, 2023. On September 30, 2023,
the Company terminated the administrative services agreement. As a result, the Company is not required to pay the sponsor $10,000 monthly
starting from September 30, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination
by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with
our initial business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of
the consummation of our initial business combination. Other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, no compensation or fees of
any kind, including finder’s fees, consulting fees and other similar fees, will be paid to our insiders or any of the members of
our management team, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence
on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of
prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by
us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest
income earned on the amounts held in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business
combination.
After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation
materials furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of a stockholder meeting
held to consider our initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive
and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current
Report on Form 8-K, as required by the SEC.

Sponsor LLC, our sponsor, is the record holder of the shares reported herein. GL Sponsor LLC is managed by Yan Xun Ng. Yan Xun Ng
may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by our sponsor by virtue of his control of our sponsor. Yan Xun Ng disclaims

of our sponsor is 1180 Avenue of the Americas, 8th Floor, New York, NY.
(4)
Public
Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. is a Malaysian private limited company and an investor who purchased 570,000 private units in the private
placement consummated simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. PGM is an affiliate of the sponsor (as defined below) as its
95% equity holder has a familial relationship with the control person of the sponsor. The address of Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd.
is Plot 21 Technoplex Medan Bayan Lepas, Taman Perindustrain Bayan Lepas, Phase IV, 11900 Penang, Malaysia. Public Gold Marketing
Sdn. Bhd. is controlled by Chun Hau Ng.
Because
of the ownership block held by our insiders, such individuals may be able to effectively exercise influence over all matters requiring
approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions other than approval
of our initial business combination.
All
of the insider shares have been placed in escrow with Continental, as escrow agent. Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of these
shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released from escrow until the earlier of six months after the date of the consummation
of our initial business combination and the date the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing
after our initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the insider shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released
from escrow until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier in either case if, subsequent
to our initial business combination, we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in
all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.
During
the escrow period, the holders of these shares will not be able to sell or transfer their securities except (1) transfers among the insiders
or their respective affiliates or members or to our officers, directors, advisors and employees, (2) transfers to an insider’s
affiliates or its members upon its liquidation, (3) transfers to relatives and trusts for estate planning purposes, (4) transfers by
virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (5) transfers pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, or (6) private
sales made at prices no greater than the price at which the securities were originally purchased, in each case where the transferee agrees
to the terms of the escrow agreement and forfeiture, as the case may be, as well as the other applicable restrictions and agreements
of the holders of the insider shares. If dividends are declared and payable in shares of common stock, such dividends will also be placed
in escrow. If we are unable to effect a business combination and liquidate, there will be no liquidation distribution with respect to
the insider shares.
Additionally,
our private investor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private units or underlying securities (except to the same
permitted transferees as the insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees
of the insider shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of our initial business combination.
In
order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of the IPO, our insiders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds,
from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units
at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the
extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete
a business combination, any outstanding loans from our insiders or their affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside
our trust account, if any.
Our
sponsor and our officers and directors are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities
laws.
Registration
Rights
The
holders of the insider shares, the private units and any units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans or extension
loans (and any securities underlying the private units or units issued upon conversion of the working capital loans or extension loans)
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement requiring us to register such securities for resale.
The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities.
In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent
to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions
Our
sponsor has agreed that, commencing on the date of the IPO prospectus through the earlier of our consummation of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, it will make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities
and administrative support, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay $10,000 per month for these services. However,
pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit committee that we
lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination.
On September 30, 2023, the Company terminated the administrative services agreement. As a result, the Company is not required to pay
the sponsor $10,000 monthly starting from September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of unpaid amount due to our
sponsor was $217,000. Such unpaid amount accrues without interest and will be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation
of our initial business combination. We believe that the fee charged by our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person.
On
each of September 5, 2023, September 29, 2023 and November 7, 2023, an affiliate of the Company’s sponsor advanced $130,000 to
the Company, for a total advance of $390,000. The $390,000 advance to fund trust extension deposits is reflected in “Due to related
parties” on the consolidated balance sheets. On March 24, 2025, the affiliate, the Company, PubCo, entered into an agreement to convert the total advance of $390,000
into ordinary shares of PubCo at a conversion price of $10.0 per share, immediately upon and subject to the closing of the Business Combination.
On
March 3, 2023, the Company entered into a promissory note subscription term sheet with Public Gold Marketing Sdn Bhd. for an amount of

each of September 5, 2023, September 29, 2023 and November 7, 2023, an affiliate of the Sponsor advanced $130,000 to the Company, for

balance sheet.

GL
Sponsor LLC, our sponsor, is the record holder of the shares reported herein. GL Sponsor LLC is managed by Yan Xun Ng. Yan Xun Ng
may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by our sponsor by virtue of his control of our sponsor. Yan Xun Ng disclaims
beneficial ownership of the shares held by our sponsor except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.
67
Other
than the fees described above, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation,
will be paid to our insiders or any of the members of our management team, for services rendered to us prior to, or in connection with
the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will
receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit
on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account, such expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.
After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, Board of Directors, management
or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in
the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time
of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination
business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of
its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K, as required by the SEC.
All
ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed
by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval
by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our
attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our
disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be
available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.
Related
Party Policy
Our
Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts
of interests, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors (or the audit committee). Related party transactions are defined
as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or
any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater
than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and
(b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial
owner of another entity). A conflict-of-interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family,
receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.
We
also require each of our directors and executive officers to annually complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that
elicits information about related party transactions.
These
procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a
conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.
To
further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated
with any of our insiders, officers or directors unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm and the
approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) that the business combination is
fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. In no event will our insiders, or any of the members of our management
team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order
to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
Director
Independence
An “independent director”
is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having
a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s Board of Directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors had determined that each of Hong Shien
Beh, Hui Liang Wong, and Kian Huat Lai is an “independent director” as defined in applicable
SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.

above.
Pre-Approval
Policy
Our
audit committee was formed in connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement for our IPO. As a result, the audit committee
did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were
approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee
has and will pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees
and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved
by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Globalink
Investment Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Globalink Investment Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024
have been restated for the correction of an error.
Explanatory
Paragraph – Going Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation that was formed for the purpose of entering into
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with
one or more businesses or entities on or before April 9, 2025 or at the discretion of the board accompanied by making additional contributions
to the trust to extend the business combination deadline by an additional two months through June 9, 2025. The Company entered into a
definitive merger agreement with a business combination target on January 30, 2024; however, the completion of this transaction is subject
to the approval of the Company’s stockholders among other conditions. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary
approvals, satisfy the required closing conditions, raise the additional capital it needs to fund its operations, and complete the transaction
prior to April 9, 2025, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline and fund
operations for any period of time after April 9, 2025, in the event that it is unable to complete a business combination by that date.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with
regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note
1 – Description of Organization and Business Operations and Liquidity
Globalink
Investment Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on March 24, 2021. The Company is a blank check company formed
for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other
similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Business Combination”).
The
Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company
is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and
emerging growth companies.
On
July 27, 2022, Globalink Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was formed. Globalink Merger
Sub, Inc. had not commenced any operations as of December 31, 2024.
On
April 3, 2024, Globalink Merger Sub (Cayman), was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Globalink
Merger Sub (Cayman) had not commenced any operations as of December 31, 2024. On December 31, 2024, Globalink Merger Sub (Cayman) was
deregistered.
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s
formation and Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), which is described below and, since the offering, the search for a prospective
initial Business Combination and negotiation for the Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of
interest income earned on investments from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The registration statement for the Company’s IPO
was declared effective on December 6, 2021. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units (“Units”)
at $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000, which is discussed in Note 4. The Company has selected December 31 as its
fiscal year end.
Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 517,500 units (“Private Placement Units”) at a price of
$10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company and
a related party of the Company, generating gross proceeds of $5,175,000, which is described in Note 5.
Additionally
with the closing of the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 Units to cover over-allotment.
On December 13, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the option and purchased 1,500,000 additional Units (the “Over-allotment
Units”), generating additional gross proceeds of $15,000,000.
Simultaneously
with the exercise of the over-allotment, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 52,500 Private Placement Units to Public
Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $525,000. Since the
underwriters’ over-allotment was exercised in full, the sponsor did not forfeit any Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6).
Offering
costs for the IPO and the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option amounted to $6,887,896, consisting of $2,300,000
of underwriting fees, $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)) and $562,896
of other costs. As described in Note 7, the $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the consummation of a
Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Following
the closing of the IPO, $116,725,000 ($10.15 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement
Units were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) and were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning
set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting
the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act.
F-7
To
mitigate the risk of being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), in July 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
the trustee of the Trust Account (the “Trustee” or “Continental”), to liquidate the U.S. government securities
or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand
deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of our Business Combination or liquidation. Furthermore, such cash is held in bank
accounts, which exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
The
Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company
must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the
Trust Account excluding the deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account at the time of the
agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no
assurance the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.
The
Company will provide the holders (the “Public Stockholders”) of the outstanding shares of common stock included in the Units,
or the Public Shares with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination
either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The
decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by
the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the
Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.15 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes
payable). There will be no redemption rights with respect to the Company’s warrants.
All
of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature, which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s
liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company’s Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended and restated and may be
further amended and restated from time to time, the “Certificate of Incorporation”). In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely
within the control of a company require the Public Shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that
the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants and rights), the initial carrying value of
common stock classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Public Shares
are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either
(i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that
the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption
value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting
period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately.
Redemptions
of the Company’s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to
an agreement relating to the Company’s Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination,
or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange
listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant
to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder
approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder
approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to
the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination,
the sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor
of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and
if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
F-8
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or
any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of 15% or more of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company.
The
Company’s sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public
Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity
to redeem their shares of common stock in conjunction with any such amendment.
The
Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Stockholders should acquire any Public Shares in or after
the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company
fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to deferred
underwriting discounts (see Note 7) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be
available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of
the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $11.62 per share held in the Trust
Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the
extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the
Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not
apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the
event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the sponsor will have to indemnify
the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
Extension
and Redemptions
The
Company originally had until March 9, 2023, 15 months from the closing of the IPO to complete a Business Combination. On March 6, 2023,
the Company held a special meeting (the “March 2023 Special Meeting”), during which the stockholders of the Company approved
a proposal to amend the Company’s amended and restated certified articles of incorporation which included extending the time in
which the Company must complete a Business Combination (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”) and a proposal to amend the Company’s
investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 6, 2021 (the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and
Continental (the “Trust Amendment Proposal”). The Company had the option of two (2) three-months extensions, followed by
three (3) one-month extensions, or until December 9, 2023, if all extensions are exercised. The Company exercised the option for two
three-month extensions and as a result the Company has deposited a total of $780,000, or $390,000 for each three-month extension, into
the Trust Account and had until September 9, 2023 to complete its Business Combination, which was funded by a promissory note with Public
Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. which has a current balance of $4,445,458. On September 9, 2023, October 4, 2023, and October 31, 2023, the
Company deposited $130,000 each time into the Trust Account, representing $0.0275 per public share, which further extended the period
of time it has to consummate its initial business combination to December 9, 2023 (“Combination Period”). The September 9,
2023, October 9, 2023 and November 1, 2023 payments were funded by the advance of $390,000 provided by an affiliate of GL Sponsor, LLC,
the Company’s sponsor (the “sponsor”).
F-9
On
March 6, 2023, in connection with the approval of the proposals presented at the March 2023 Special Meeting which extended the time in
which the Company must complete a Business Combination, holders of 6,756,695 of the Company’s shares of common stock exercised
their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.35 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $69.92 million.
On
November 28, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “November 2023 Special Meeting”). At the November
2023 Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the
“Charter Amendment No. 1”), changing the structure and cost of the Company’s right to extend the date (the “Termination
Date”) by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such
business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company’s outstanding public shares of common stock included as
part of the units sold in the Company’s IPO that closed on December 9, 2021, which was December 9, 2023 at the time of the November
2023 Special Meeting unless extended. The Charter Amendment allows the Company to extend the Termination Date by up to twelve (12) monthly
extensions, to December 9, 2024 (each of which is referred to as an “Extension”, and such later date, the “Extended
Deadline”). To obtain each Extension, the Company, its sponsor or any of their affiliates or designees must deposit into the Company’s
Trust Account with Continental by the deadline applicable prior to such Extension $60,000 for each monthly Extension; approved the proposal
(the “Extension Amendment Proposal”) to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which
the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination,
and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company’s outstanding public shares of common stock included as part of the units sold
in the Company’s IPO that was consummated on December 9, 2021, from December 9, 2023 to, if the Company elects to extend the date
to consummate a business combination, for up to twelve monthly Extensions, December 9, 2024, unless the closing of the Company’s
initial business combination shall have occurred; approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Trust Agreement with Continental
(the “Trust Amendment Proposal”), pursuant to which the Company’s Trust Agreement with Continental be amended to extend
the time for the Company to complete its initial business combination under the Trust Agreement from (x) December 9, 2023, to (y) up
to December 9, 2024, if the Company elects to extend the date to consummate a business combination, for up to twelve monthly Extensions,
by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each one-month Extension from December 9, 2023 to December 9, 2024, unless the closing
of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred; and approved the proposal to re-elect Kian Huat Lai as Class
I director of the Company, until the annual meeting of the Company to be held in 2026 or until his successor is appointed and qualified.
On
November 28, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, allowing
the Company to the Extended Deadline from December 9, 2023 to up to December 9, 2024 through monthly Extensions. To obtain each Extension,
the Company, its sponsor or any of their affiliates or designees must deposit into the Company’s Trust Account with Continental
by the deadline applicable prior to such Extension, $60,000 for each Extension. On November 28, 2023, the stockholders of the Company
also approved a proposal to amend the Company’s Trust Agreement (as defined above), by and between the Company and Continental.
In connection with the approval of the proposals presented at the special meeting held on November 28, 2023, holders of 2,180,738 shares
of the Company’s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.82 per share,
for an aggregate of approximately $23.60 million.
From
November 2023 to November 2024, the Company has extended the Termination Date twelve times under its Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended (or seventeen times since the IPO), and has until December 9, 2024 to complete its initial business combination.
F-10
On
December 3, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “December 2024 Special Meeting”). At the December
2024 Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the
“Charter Amendment No.2”), allowing the Company to extend the Termination Date by up to six (6) monthly Extensions, to June
9, 2025. To obtain each Extension, the Company, its sponsor or any of their affiliates or designees must deposit into the Company’s
Trust Account with Continental by the deadline applicable prior to the extension $60,000 for each monthly Extension. In connection with
the meeting, Hui Liang Wong and Hong Shien Beh were elected as Class II directors of the Company, until the annual meeting of the Company
to be held in 2027 or until their successors are appointed and qualified.
In
connection with the votes at December 2024 Special Meeting, holders of 2,285,056 shares of the Company’s common stock exercised
their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $11.77 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $26.89 million.
Following the payment of the redemptions, the Trust Account had a balance of approximately $3.27 million.
On
each of December 5, 2024, January 4, 2025, February 5, 2025 and March 6, 2025, the Company deposited four tranches of $60,000, for
an aggregated of $240,000 into the Trust Account, extending the Termination Date to April 9, 2025.
Nasdaq
Notice
On
October 16, 2023, the Company received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2),
which requires the Company to maintain at least 400 total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Minimum
Total Holders Rule”). The Notice is only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on
the listing or trading of the Company’s securities on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Notice stated that the Company had 45 calendar
days, or until November 30, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule. On January 29, 2024, the
Company submitted an application to phase-down from The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market. On March 6, 2024, the Company
received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff granting the Company’s request for transfer to The Nasdaq Capital
Market. The Company’s securities were transferred to The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on March 12, 2024. In
connection with the approval of the phase-down application, the staff indicated that the Company’s deficiency with the Minimum
Total Holders Rule was cured and the matter was closed.
On
December 10, 2024, the Company, received a notice (the “Delisting Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of
the Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires a special purpose acquisition company
to complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement. Since the Company
failed to complete its initial business combination by December 6, 2024, the Company did not comply with IM-5101-2, which triggered the
issuance of a delisting determination from Nasdaq to delist the Company’s securities. According to the Delisting Notice, the Company’s
common stock, warrants, rights and units would be suspended at the opening of business on December 17, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE would
be filed with the SEC, which would remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company did not
appeal this ruling. The Company transferred its securities, including common stock, warrants, rights and units, to OTC Pink for quotation
under the same ticker symbols following the delisting of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq. Despite the delisting of its securities,
the Company expects to continue proceeding with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as defined below).
F-11
Business
Combination
On
January 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (as amended and restated on May 20, 2024 and as may be further amended,
restated or supplemented from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among GL Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, in the capacity as the representative from and after the effective time of the Acquisition Merger (as defined below) (the “Effective
Time”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Parent Representative” or the “Sponsor”),
Alps Global Holding Pubco, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“PubCo”), Alps Biosciences Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo (“Merger Sub”), Alps Life Sciences Inc, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Alps
Holdco”) and Dr. Tham Seng Kong, an individual, in the capacity as the representative from and after the Effective Time for the
shareholders of Alps Holdco as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
(the “Seller Representative”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination between Globalink
and Alps Holdco will be effected in two steps: (i) subject to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, the Company will be merged with and into PubCo, with PubCo remaining as the surviving publicly traded entity and (ii) Merger
Sub will merge with and into Alps Holdco, resulting in Alps Holdco remaining as the surviving entity and being a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PubCo (the “Acquisition Merger”).
On
March 6, 2025, Globalink, Alps Holdco, Parent Representative and Seller Representative, entered into a First
Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which, parties agreed to:
●remove
the earn-out provision from the Merger Agreement; and
●remove
the $5,000,001 net tangible asset requirement for (i) Globalink immediately prior to the
Closing, and (ii) PubCo upon Closing, provided that the PubCo satisfies the listing requirements
of and is approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market.
On
June 4, June 5 and August 27, 2024, the Company, Alps Holdco and PubCo entered into subscription agreements with three investors on
substantially same terms, pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo has agreed to issue and sell to the investors, and the
investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase certain number of ordinary shares of PubCo (“PIPE Shares”) at a purchase
price of $10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $40,200,000,
in a private placement. As of the date of this report, the Company, Alps Holdco and PubCo are negotiating termination
agreements with two investors who entered into the subscription agreements to purchase $40
million worth of PIPE Shares, dated June 4, 2024 and June 5, 2024, respectively, and the parties expect to enter into such
termination agreement prior to the closing of the initial Business Combination.
Subsequent to December 31, 2024, the Company, Alps Holdco and PubCo entered into additional subscription agreements
(together with previous executed subscription agreement on August 27, 2024, the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with several
investors on substantially same terms (together with previous investor who entered into a subscription agreement dated August 27, 2024,
the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo has agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, and
the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase certain number of ordinary shares of PubCo at a purchase price of $10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $3,279,911, in a private placement (the “PIPE Investment”). As of the date
of this report, the PIPE Investors have subscribed for an aggregate of $3,479,911 (excluding the $40 million subscription expected to
be terminated). Up to the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, PIPE Investment of $879,911 was received
by PubCo’s escrow agent, and held in an escrow account on behalf of PubCo.
The purpose of the PIPE Investment is to raise additional capital for use by PubCo following the closing of the Business
Combination (the “Closing”). The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations and warranties of each of
the Company, Alps Holdco, PubCo and the PIPE Investors, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Business
Combination. Under the terms of the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is obligated to file a registration statement to register for
the resale of all the PIPE Shares within 60 days of the Closing (the “Filing Deadline”), and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after the filing there of.
Risks
and Uncertainties
The
Company continues to evaluate the impact of increases in inflation and rising interest rates, financial market instability, including
the recent bank failures, the potential government shutdown, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain geopolitical
events, including the wars in Ukraine and the surrounding region and between Israel and Hamas. The Company has concluded that while it
is reasonably possible that the risks and uncertainties related to or resulting from these events could have a negative effect on its
financial position, results of operations and/or ability to complete an initial Business Combination, the Company cannot at this time
fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively
impact the Company’s business and its ability to complete an initial Business Combination.
F-12
On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and
certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed
on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally
1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise
tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value
of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the
abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.
Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise,
may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business
Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions
and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii)
the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued
not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content
of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the
redeeming holder. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s
ability to complete a Business Combination.
During
the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise
Tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023
to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024.
The
Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this obligation. Any amount of such Excise Tax not paid in full, will be
subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at 10% interest per annum and a 5% underpayment penalty per
month or portion of a month up to 25% of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full.
Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company had $253,507 of cash available to meet working capital needs and a working capital deficit of approximately
$6.8 million.
Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company will need to raise
additional capital through loans or additional investments from its sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The
Company’s officers, directors and the sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any
time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly,
the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.
If
the Business Combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
from its sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and its sponsor may, but
are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole
discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.
If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could
include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead
expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at
all.
F-13
In
connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, “Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” the Company currently has until April 9, 2025
to consummate a business combination, or up to June 9, 2025 if the time to complete the initial business combination is extended as described
herein. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a business combination by this time. If a business combination is
not consummated by this date and an extension is not requested by the sponsor, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution
of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and an extension is
not requested by the sponsor, and potential subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity condition noted above raises substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or
liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after April 9, 2025 (or up to June 9, 2025 if the time to complete the initial
business combination is extended as described herein). The Company intends to complete a business combination before the mandatory liquidation
date.
Note
2 — Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
In
connection with the December 2024 Extension Meeting, as set forth in the Company’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2024, the holders of 2,285,056 shares of the Company’s common stock properly exercised their
right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s trust account. On December 11, 2024, a redemption
payment was made by CST, as trustee of the Trust Account, to the December 2024 Extension Redeeming Stockholders at a rate of $11.76793003
per share. It was later determined that the Company did not withdrawal all of the interest from the trust account that was permitted
to withdrawal to cover income and franchise taxes and, therefore, the December 2024 Redemption Payment should have been approximately
$11.52149928 per share. This meant that the December 2024 Extension Redeeming Stockholders were overpaid in the amount of $0.24643075
per share.
As
a result of the December 2024 Extension Overpayment Amount, the Company lacked the available amounts of interest in the trust
account to fully cover the permitted withdrawals for income tax and franchise tax liabilities. When calculating the common stock
subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2024, considering permitted withdrawals for income and franchise taxes the per
share redemption price was below the $10.15 (“principal
per share price”) reported at the initial public offering. As a result, within the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2024, the Company adjusted the common stock subject to possible redemption to reflect the principal per share price reported at the
initial public offering. After further review, management determined that the principal per share price that was reported within the
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, did not consider additional extension payments that were placed into the trust
account by the Sponsor and interest earned that was included in
the December 2024 Extension Overpayment Amount for non-redeeming stockholders, which has been now considered within this Form 10-K/A for the year ended
December 31, 2024. The table below represents the impacts of this error to the consolidated financial statements and

3 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Emerging
Growth Company
The
Company is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS
Act”), which exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a
class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards.
The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out
of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for
public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s consolidated financial statements with another public
company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition
period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. One of the more significant
accounting estimates included in these consolidated financial statements is the determination of the fair value of the warrant liabilities.
Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set
of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could
change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
F-14
Cash
Held in Trust Account
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in cash.
To
mitigate the risk of being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), on July 27, 2023, the Company instructed the Trustee of the Trust Account, to liquidate
the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account
in cash (which may include demand deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of our Business Combination or liquidation. Furthermore,
such cash is held in bank accounts, which exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the FDIC.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution,
which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation coverage limit. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
had not experienced losses on these accounts.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures,” approximate the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, primarily
due to their short-term nature.
Income
Taxes
The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability
approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based
on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances
are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
the Company’s deferred tax asset for start up organizational expenses had a full valuation allowance recorded against it.
FASB
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely
than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 or
December 31, 2023. No amounts were paid for interest and penalties for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Interest and
penalties related to the December 31, 2022 tax return of $11,888 was expensed on December 31, 2023. The Company is currently
not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of income tax payable was
$479,279 (including $239,374 of tax payable due from the year ended December 31, 2023) and $529,505, respectively. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
Excise
Tax
In
connection with the vote to approve the charter amendment proposal presented at the March 2023 Special Meeting, holders of 6,756,695
shares of common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares of common stock for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately
$69.92 million. In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting
on November 28, 2023, holders of 2,180,738 shares of the Company’s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for
cash at an approximate price of $10.82 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $23.60 million. In connection with the votes at December
2024 Special Meeting, holders of 2,285,056 shares of the Company’s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for
cash at an approximate price of $11.77 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $26.89 million. Immediately following the payment
of redemptions, the Trust Account had a balance of approximately $3.27 million. As such, the Company has recorded a 1% Excise Tax
liability in the amount of $1,313,485, including interest and penalty of $109,368, on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. The liability does not impact the consolidated
statements of operations and is offset against additional paid-in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid-in capital is not
available.
F-15
During
the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise
Tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023
to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. Any amount of such Excise Tax not paid in full, will be subject to additional interest
and penalties which are currently estimated at 10% interest per annum and a 5% underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up
to 25% of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full.
As
of December 31, 2024, $1,313,485 excise tax liability was due, and the Company recognized $15,847 interest and $93,521 penalties in connection
with the unpaid excise tax.
Shares
of Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument
and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are
either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s
control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s
shares of common stock sold in the IPO and as a result of the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option features certain
redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events.
Accordingly, on December 31, 2024 and 2023, 277,511 and 2,562,567 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption were presented
as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
On
March 6, 2023, in connection with the approval of the extension amendment proposal and the trust amendment proposal presented at the
March 2023 Special Meeting, holders of 6,756,695 of the Company’s shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem those
shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.35 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $69.92 million.
On
November 28, 2023, in connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the November
2023 Special Meeting, holders of 2,180,738 shares of the Company’s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for
cash at an approximate price of $10.82 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $23.60 million.
In
connection with the December 2024 Special Meeting held on December 3, 2024, holders of 2,285,056 shares of the Company’s common
stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $11.77 per share, for an aggregate of approximately
$26.89 million.
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the shares of common stock subject to possible redemption reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
is reconciled in the following table:

Net
(Loss) Income Per Share of Common Stock
The
Company complies with the accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share” and uses the
two class method. Net (loss) income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the shares of common
stock subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders.
The
Company has one authorized class of common stock. Warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO (the “Public Warrants”)
(see Note 4) and warrants included in the Private Placement Units (the “Private Placement Warrants,” together with the Public
Warrants, the “warrants”) (see Note 5) to purchase 7,242,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $10.00 per share were
issued on December 9, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, no Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants had been
exercised. The 7,242,000 potential shares of common stock underlying the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to
purchase the Company’s shares of common stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024
and 2023 because they are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. Additionally, the rights are able to
be demanded on or any time after the Business Combination, and as the contingency has not been met, the rights are excluded from diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock is
the same as basic net income (loss) per share of common stock for the years. The table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net income per share for each class of stock.
The
following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share (in dollars, except per share amounts):

Accounting
for Warrants
The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”)
and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial
instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock, among other
conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant
issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. The Company accounts for the warrants
issued in connection with the Company’s IPO in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 under which the public warrants
meet the criteria for equity treatment and the private warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as
liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the private warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the private warrants
to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any
change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated
using a binomial lattice model.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments
in this ASU require disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief
operating officer decision maker (“CODM”), as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported
measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation
of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and
entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and existing
segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASC 2023-07 for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires
disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among
other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company’s management is still evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial
statements.

4 — Initial Public Offering and Over-allotment
Pursuant
to the IPO and the over-allotment in December 2021, the Company sold 11,500,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists
of one share of common stock, one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant” and collectively, the “Public Warrants”)
and one right (each a “Public Right” and collectively, the “Public Rights”). Each Public Warrant entitles its
holder to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Each Public Right
entitles the holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination (see Note 9).
F-18
Note
5 — Private Placement
On
December 9, 2021 and December 13, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the underwriters’ exercise of their
over-allotment option, the Company consummated the issuance and sale (“Private Placement”) of 570,000 Private Placement Units
in a private placement transaction at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $5,700,000. Each whole
Private Placement Unit consists of one share, one warrant (each a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively the “Private
Placement Warrants”) and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination.
Each whole Private Placement Warrant will be exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.
A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If
the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement
Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Placement
Units and all underlying securities will be worthless.

Founder
Shares
On
August 19, 2021, the Company’s sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s common
stock, par value $0.001, for an aggregate price of $25,000. The Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described
in Note 9.
The
Initial Stockholders have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, that 50% of these shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or
released from escrow until the earlier of six months after the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination
and the date on which the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after
its initial Business Combination and the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released from
escrow until six months after the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier, in either
case, if, subsequent to the Company’s initial Business Combination, the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange
or other similar transaction which results in all of its stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash,
securities or other property.
Private
Placement
Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 570,000 units (“Private Placement Units”) at a price of
$10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company, a related
party generating gross proceeds of $5,700,000, which is described in Note 5.
Related
Party Loans
In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor,
or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working
Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company will repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds
of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the
Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust
Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans.
Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post Business
Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. As of December 31, 2024
and 2023, there were no Working Capital Loans outstanding.
The
Company entered into promissory notes with Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd., which is considered a related party due to a familial relationship
between the controlling member of the sponsor and a 95% shareholder of Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. The promissory notes bear an interest
of 6% per annum and repayable upon consummation of an initial Business Combination (Note 8).

Support
Services
The
Company has entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay its sponsor a total of $10,000 per
month for office space, administrative and support services. On September 30, 2023, the Company terminated the administrative services
agreement. As a result, the Company is no longer be required to pay the sponsor $10,000 monthly since September 30, 2023.
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $217,000 had been accrued under this arrangement and shown under “Due to related parties”
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Advances
On
each of September 5, 2023, September 29, 2023 and November 7, 2023, an affiliate of the Company’s sponsor advanced $130,000 to
the Company, for a total advance of $390,000. The $390,000 advance to fund trust extension deposits is reflected in “Due to related
parties” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Registration
Rights
The
holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Units and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any,
will be entitled to registration rights (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion of such shares into shares of common
stock) pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the date of the prospectus for the IPO. These holders are entitled to certain
demand and “piggyback” registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not
permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up
period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration
statements.
Underwriting
Agreement
The
underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit on the offering including the Units issued with the underwriter’s
exercise of their over-allotment option, or $2,300,000 in the aggregate at the closing of the IPO. In addition, the underwriters are
entitled to deferred underwriting discounts of $0.35 per unit, or $4,025,000 from the closing of the IPO and the exercise of the over-allotment
option. The deferred discounts will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if the Company
completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

Note
9 — Stockholders’ Deficit
Common
stock
The
Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
there were 3,445,000 (excluding 277,511 and 2,562,567 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively) shares of
common stock issued and outstanding.
Warrants:
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 11,500,000 Public Warrants and 570,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding.
The
Public Warrants are accounted for as equity instruments in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Public Warrants may
only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public
Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the
completion of an initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption. No Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the
Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public
Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement
covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within a specified period following
the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and
during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that
exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public
Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
Redemption
of warrants when the price per common stock equals or exceeds $16.50
Once
the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private
placement warrants):
●
in
whole and not in part;
●
at
a price of $0.01 per warrant;
●
upon
a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, which the Company refers to as the “30-day redemption period”;
and
●
if,
and only if, the last reported sale price (the “closing price”) of our common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share
(as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under
the heading “Description of Securities—Warrants”) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending
on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
The
Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common
stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may
exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable
state securities laws.
If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement.
The
Private Placement Warrants are substantially in the same form as the Public Warrants, except they (i) will be exercisable either for
cash or on a cashless basis at the holder’s option pursuant and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in either case as long
as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees (as prescribed in the Subscription
Agreement, dated December 6, 2021, by and between the Company and Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd.). Once a Private Placement Warrant
is transferred to a holder other than a permitted transferee, it shall be treated as a Public Warrant for all purposes. Due to these
terms the Private Warrants are required to be liability classified.
F-22
The
exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including
in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants
will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below their respective exercise prices. Additionally, in no event
will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of the warrants will not receive any of such
funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust
Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.
In
addition, if the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.50 per share of common stock (with
such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors, and in the case of
any such issuance to the initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by them prior
to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest
thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions),
and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the
trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below
$9.50 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the greater of (i)
the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional common stock or equity-linked securities.
Rights
Except
in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a Public Right will automatically receive
one-tenth of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of a Public Right converted all
shares held by him, her or it in connection with a Business Combination or an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation
with respect to its pre-business combination activities. In the event that the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion
of a Business Combination, each holder of a Public Right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to
receive the one-tenth of a share underlying each Public Right upon consummation of the Business Combination.
The
Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of Public Rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down
to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
As a result, the holders of the Public Rights must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of the holders’
rights upon closing of a Business Combination.

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the change in valuation allowance was $200,505 and $199,988, respectively.

The
Company’s effective tax rate was (32.48)% and 28.61% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective
tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to changes in the fair
value in warrant liabilities, valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets, non-deductible M&A costs, income tax penalties, and
failed deal costs that are fully deductible.
The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction in various state and local jurisdictions and is subject to examination
by the various taxing authorities.
Note
11 — Fair Value Measurements
The
fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would
have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company
seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable
inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is
used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and
liabilities:
Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which
transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
F-24
Level
2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets
or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level
3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability.
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in cash.
The
following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair
value.

As of December 31, 2024, the Private Placement Warrants were valued using
the observable price for the public warrant as a benchmark, as a result of which, the fair value of the Private
Placement Warrant liability was re-classified as Level 2. As of December 31, 2023, the Private Placement Warrants were valued using
a binomial lattice mode, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. One of the more significant inputs is the implied
volatility, which is based on the observed prices of the Company’s common stock and publicly-traded warrants. As of December 31,
2023, the estimated fair value of Warrant Liabilities – Private Warrants
were determined based on the following significant inputs and are expressed on the basis of each being exercisable for a one-half of
one share of common stock:

NOTE
12. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Segment Information
ASC
Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statements information about
operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”), or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The
Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had
not commenced any operations. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business
Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents
from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering, which are held in Trust Account, and non-operating income or
expense from the changes in the fair value of warrant liability and Capital Contribution Note, which are not considered measures of financial
performance used by the CODM.
The
Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews the consolidated operating results for the Company
as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, management has determined that
the Company only has one operating segment. The CODM does not review assets, which primarily consists of cash held in the Trust Account, in evaluating the results of the Company, and therefore,
such information is not presented.
When
evaluating the Company’s primary measure of performance and making
key decisions, by the CODM, regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics, which include the following:

$3,090,407
The
key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM are interest earned on investment in Trust Account and formation and operating
expenses. The CODM reviews interest earned on investment in Trust Account to measure and monitor shareholder value and determine the
most effective strategy of investment with the Trust Account funds while maintaining compliance with the trust agreement. Within the
operating expenses, the CODM specifically reviews professional service fees in connection with the Business Combination, which are a
significant segment expense, and include legal fees, and advisory fees, as these represent significant costs affecting the Company’s
consummation of the Business Combination. Other operating expenses, including accounting expenses, printing expenses, and regulatory
filing fees, are reviewed in aggregate to ensure alignment with budget and contractual obligations. These expenses are monitored to manage
and forecast cash available to complete a business combination within the required period.
