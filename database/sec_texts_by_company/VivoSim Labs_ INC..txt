Item 11. Executive Compensation. The following discussion is designed to provide our stockholders with an understanding of our compensation philosophy and objectives as well as an overview of the analysis that our Compensation Committee performed in setting the compensation of our executive officers for Fiscal 2025 (i.e., the period from April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025). This discussion summarizes the Compensation Committee’s determination of how and why, in addition to what, compensation actions were taken for our named executive officers, as follows:•Keith Murphy, our Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer;•Norman Staskey, our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer; and•Thomas Hess, our former Chief Financial Officer and former Principal Financial Officer(1).(1)Mr. Hess resigned from the Company effective as of December 24, 2024, from his part-time role to pursue retirement. These three individuals are collectively referred to in this Annual Report as our “named executive officers”. Mr. Murphy and Mr. Staskey were the only executive officers serving at the end of Fiscal 2025.   Recent “Say-on-Pay” Votes Our recent stockholder advisory votes, commonly referred to as a “Say-on-Pay” vote, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers for Fiscal 2024 (i.e., the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024) was approved by our stockholders, with approximately 92% of stockholder votes cast in favor of the proposal. During Fiscal 2025, our Executive Chairman, former Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Financial Officer maintained significant stockholder engagement efforts to monitor how our investors vote, obtain their views on key corporate governance and disclosure matters and determine how best to respond to feedback each year going forward. Specifically, we reached out to our stockholders representing over 95% of our institutional stock holdings multiple times. None of the stockholders indicated a need or desire to engage with the Company to discuss or express any concerns.
Going forward, we plan to continue to: •at least annually, reach out to institutional stockholders representing a majority of the shares held by our institutional stockholders; and•invite them to engage and participate in calls to discuss our executive compensation programs, their feedback and questions and how we may best address them.
One or more members of executive management are expected to be active participants on all such calls, as will one or more members of our Compensation Committee. All such feedback will be shared with our Board.
In evaluating potential changes to our executive compensation programs’ structure and disclosure, the Compensation Committee will closely examine, and aim to understand further, our stockholders’ feedback, including any common themes from our stockholders’ feedback. The Compensation Committee will also seek the advice of independent compensation consultants with respect to the design of our executive compensation program.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives Our executive compensation program focuses on creating alignment between our stockholders and executive officers by including both performance- and incentive-based compensation elements.
Our compensation package also combines both short- and long-term components (cash and equity, respectively) at the levels the Compensation Committee determined to be appropriate to motivate, reward, and retain our executive officers.
Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve the following key objectives:•Attract, retain, and reward talented executives and motivate them to contribute to the Company’s success and to build long-term stockholder value;•Establish financial incentives for executives to achieve our key financial, operational, and strategic goals;•Enhance the relationship between executive pay and stockholder value by utilizing long-term equity incentives; and
5
•Recognize and reward executives for superior performance. Use of Market Data and Benchmarking The Compensation Committee endeavors to set compensation at competitive levels.
In order to do this, the Compensation Committee compares our compensation packages with the packages offered by other peer companies that are similarly situated, and with which we compete for talent. Selection criteria includes:•Industry, specifically biotechnology and medical research,•Company focus, with an emphasis on technology platforms,•Stage of leading drug candidate, with an emphasis on Phase II/III,•Market capitalization, targeting less than $100 million,•Number of employees, targeting less than 50 employees, and•Location, specifically nationwide. For Fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee engaged Anderson Pay Advisors ("Anderson"), an independent compensation consultant, as the Compensation Committee’s advisor reporting directly to the chair of the Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee determined that no conflict of interest exists that would preclude Anderson from serving as an independent consultant to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee requested that Anderson conduct a review and analysis of our executive compensation programs as compared against competitive benchmarks. This included a benchmarking analysis against prevailing market practices of a peer group of comparable companies approved by the Compensation Committee and broader industry trends and benchmarks.
The analysis included a review of the “Total Direct Compensation” (which includes salary, cash incentives, and equity awards) of our executive officers, and was based on an assessment of market trends covering available public information as well as proprietary information provided by Anderson. For Fiscal 2025, based on recommendations from Anderson, our Compensation Committee determined that our peer group should be modified to better reflect our current market valuation as well as the growing importance of our therapeutics program to our overall business model.
With input from Anderson, our Compensation Committee added a group of companies focused on technology platforms, with comparable size, revenues, market valuations, and stage of leading drug candidate.
Our Compensation Committee also replaced some of the companies previously included in our peer group because their market valuations had grown too high for direct comparison to our Company, and/or their business focus had become less relevant for direct comparison to our Company. Our Compensation Committee then used the compensation data from this revised peer group in setting executive compensation for Fiscal 2025. The peer group for Fiscal 2025 included:
Aligos Therapeutics, Inc.
Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Scorpius Holdings, Inc.*
Anika Therapeutics, Inc.*
Hoth Therapeutics, Inc.*
Seelos Therapeutics, Inc.
Aprea Therapeutics, Inc.
Immunic Therapeutics, Inc.*
Soligenix, Inc.
Ayala Pharmaceuticals
Imunon, Inc.
Theriva Biologics, Inc.
Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc.*
LadRx Corp.
Traws Pharma, Inc.*
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Inc.*
Lifecore Biomedical*
Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
Pulmatrix, Inc.
* Indicates addition to peer group from Fiscal 2024. Determination of Executive Compensation In addition to peer group data, the Compensation Committee considered relevant publicly available market data and surveys and the compensation reports it received from Anderson.
The Compensation Committee also reviewed and considered the compensation recommendations of our Executive Chairman, the Company’s overall performance during Fiscal 2025, the Company’s financial status and operating runway, each executive officer’s responsibilities and contribution to the Company’s achievement of the Fiscal 2025 corporate goals, and each executive officer’s individual performance during Fiscal 2025.
With respect to new hires, our Compensation Committee considered the executive officer’s background and historical compensation in lieu of prior year performance in addition to benchmark data for the newly hired executive’s position.

Commitment to Good Compensation Governance Practices In designing our executive compensation program, our Compensation Committee intends to create alignment between our stockholders and executive officers and to implement good compensation governance by:•Annual Advisory Vote on the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers – We provide our stockholders with the ability to vote annually on the compensation of our named executive officers.•Independent Compensation Consultant – The Compensation Committee engaged Anderson during Fiscal 2025 to serve as its independent compensation consultant. Anderson did not provide any other services to the Company during the periods it served as a consultant to the Compensation Committee.•Performance and Incentive Based – Previously, approximately 40% of the Total Direct Compensation our executive officers could earn was performance and incentive based, thereby aligning the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders’ interests. As our current executive officers are retained through consulting firms, neither are eligible for performance based compensation.•Compensation Risk Assessment – The Compensation Committee oversees and evaluates an annual risk assessment of the Company’s compensation program.
The Compensation Committee believes that the performance goals established for incentives do not encourage excessive risk-taking or have the potential to encourage behavior that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.•Prohibitions on Hedging, Pledging and Margin Activities – Our insider trading policy prohibits hedging transactions by Company employees.
Under the policy, all short-term, speculative or hedging transactions in VivoSim securities are prohibited by all employees.
In addition, the policy specifically prohibits the use of VivoSim securities for pledging and margin activities.•No Single Trigger Change in Control Vesting - We do not provide for the acceleration of vesting solely upon the occurrence of a change in control in our equity awards for our directors and executive officers. •No Excise Tax Gross Ups – We do not include excise tax gross ups for any change in control payments.•Director and Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines – We have adopted stock ownership guidelines that require each director and executive officer to accumulate and hold a specified value of our stock within five years of most recently starting employment with us or becoming a director.
The Compensation Committee believes that the program and policies described above demonstrate the Company’s commitment to, and consistent execution of, an effective performance-oriented executive compensation program. Components of Executive CompensationThe framework established by the Compensation Committee, based on the data provided by Anderson, for our executive compensation program consists of a base salary, performance-based cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.
The Compensation Committee endeavors to combine these compensation elements to develop a compensation package that provides competitive pay, rewards our executive officers for achieving our commercial, operational and strategic objectives and aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. Salary.
The Compensation Committee has provided, and will continue to provide, our executive officers with a base salary to compensate them for services provided during the fiscal year.
In addition to benchmark data from our peer group, our Compensation Committee considers the Company’s overall performance during the prior fiscal year, cash burn, the Company’s financial status and operating profile, each executive officer’s responsibilities and contribution to the achievement of the prior year’s corporate goals, and each executive officer’s individual performance during the prior fiscal year.
The evaluations and recommendations proposed by our Executive Chairman are also considered (other than with respect to determining his own compensation).
With respect to new hires, the Compensation Committee considers an executive’s background and historical compensation in lieu of prior year performance as well as benchmark data for the new hire’s position.
Our Compensation Committee evaluates and sets the base salaries for our executives following annual performance evaluations, as well as upon a promotion or other change in responsibility.
Our Compensation Committee expects to continue to utilize these policies going forward.

The Company continues to use an objectives and key results goal-setting framework (“OKRs”) used by individuals, teams, and the Company to define measurable goals and track their outcomes, originally developed and implemented by Andrew Grove at Intel. See: http://www.whatmatters.com. Mr. Murphy is retained through MDBI, a biotechnology consulting firm, pursuant to the terms of a consulting agreement.

Equity-Based Incentive Awards.
In addition to base salaries and annual performance-based cash incentives, the Compensation Committee has provided long-term, equity-based incentive awards to our executive officers.
In determining the size and terms of the awards, the Compensation Committee considered benchmark data from our peer group, publicly available market and survey data and the individual performance of the named executive officers. On August 5, 2024, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Murphy options to purchase the aggregate number of shares of common stock equal to 7% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock at the time of grant, consisting of (a) a time-based
8
option to purchase 47,910 shares of common stock, or 4% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the date of grant (the “Time-Based Option), and (b) three performance-based options to purchase an aggregate of 35,931 shares of common stock, or 3%, of the outstanding shares of common stock on the date of grant (the “Performance-Based Options” and together with the Time-Based Option, the “Options”). The Time-Based Option has an exercise price of $6.44 and vests in 3 equal annual installments on each of August 5, 2025, August 5, 2026 and August 5, 2027. The Performance-Based Options are each for 11,977 shares of common stock, have an exercise price of $6.44 vest upon the achievement of the milestones applicable to each Performance-Based Option, as follows: (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a collaboration or partnership, which in the sole judgment of our Board or a committee thereof, constitutes a major strategic partnership that expands the Company's business relationships, (2) the 90-day moving average closing price of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC exceeds $18.36 per share, and (3) the Company achieves cumulative revenue of $1.5 million from combined cell line sales, IP licensing revenue, including up-front and royalty payments, non-dilutive collaborations, grants and partnerships, as confirmed by our Board or a committee thereof.
The Compensation Committee further approved that in the event that the Company closed an equity financing (in one or more tranches) after August 5, 2024 and on or prior to March 31, 2025 (the “Financing”) and the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Time-Based Option and the Performance-Based Option was equal to less than 4% and 3%, respectively, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such Financing (in all cases assuming no exercise of any of the Options) (“Post-Financing Shares Outstanding”), Mr. Murphy would be granted: (a) an additional time-based option to purchase such number of shares of common stock as was equal to 4% of the Post-Financing Shares Outstanding minus the number of shares initially issuable upon exercise of the Time-Based Option, and/or (b) an additional performance-based option to purchase such number of shares of common stock as was equal to 3% of the Post-Financing Shares Outstanding minus the number of shares of common stock initially issuable upon exercise of the Performance-Based Option ((a) and (b) collectively, the “True-Up Options”), each of which would be subject to the vesting requirements (including the vesting commencement date) and substantially the same terms as the Time-Based Option and Performance-Based Option, respectively, other than that the exercise price for such True-Up Options would be the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant, which would be the date of the closing of the Financing. The Company did not close a Financing by the deadline of March 31, 2025, and therefore no True-Up Options were granted. Other BenefitsIn order to attract and retain qualified individuals and pay market levels of compensation, we have historically provided, and will continue to provide, our executives with the following benefits:•Health Insurance – We provide each of our executives and their spouses and children the same health, dental, and vision insurance coverage we make available to our other eligible employees.•Life and Disability Insurance – We provide each of our executives with the same life and disability insurance as we make available to our other eligible employees.•Pension Benefits – We do not provide pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executives or employees.

In certain cases, we have reimbursed our executive officers for their relocation expenses on their initial hire. Severance Arrangements During Fiscal 2025, none of our executive officers were party to any agreements or arrangements providing for severance payments.  Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control As of March 31, 2025, none of our named executive officers were entitled to receive any payments upon termination or change of control.
9
Death or Disability Benefits The outstanding equity awards held by our executive officers provide such executive officers with accelerated vesting if the executive officer terminates services with the Company as a result of death or disability.
In order for an equity award to be eligible for accelerated vesting, the executive officer’s death or disability must occur more than 90 days after the date the equity award was granted.

As of March 31, 2025, neither Mr. Staskey nor Mr. Hess held any outstanding equity awards. Director Compensation
Our directors play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and overseeing the management of our Company.
Ongoing developments in corporate governance and financial reporting have resulted in an increased demand for such highly qualified and productive public company directors.
The many responsibilities and risks and the substantial time commitment of being a director of a public company require that we provide adequate incentives for our directors’ continued performance by paying compensation commensurate with our directors’ workload.
Our directors are compensated based upon their respective levels of Board participation and responsibilities, including service on Board committees. Our director compensation is overseen by the Compensation Committee, which makes recommendations to our Board on the appropriate structure for our director compensation program and the appropriate amount of compensation. Our Board is responsible for final approval of our director compensation program and the compensation paid to our directors. In connection with establishing our director compensation for Fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee retained Anderson as its independent compensation consultant. With the assistance of Anderson, the Board and Compensation Committee conducted a formal review of our director compensation and incentive programs relative to the same peer group used in benchmarking the compensation for our executive officers.
Fiscal 2025 Director Compensation Framework For Fiscal 2025, our Director Compensation Framework provided to both non-employee and employee directors annual cash retainers for Board service and for service as the chair or member of one of the standing Board committees. Our directors are not entitled to any Board meeting fees or Board committee meeting fees.
Annual Cash Retainers.
For Fiscal 2025, each of our directors was eligible to receive an annual cash retainer of $66,300 for Board membership.
In addition, each of our directors are eligible to receive the applicable annual retainers set forth below for serving as committee chairs and for service as a member of a Board committee, with total cash compensation for each director not to exceed $105,000 per fiscal year:

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation No member of our Compensation Committee has at any time been our employee.
None of our executive officers serves, or has served during the last fiscal year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee. Equity Award Timing Procedures In accordance with Item 402(x) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we are providing information regarding our procedures related to the grant of certain equity awards close in time to the release of material non-public information (“MNPI”). Although we do not have a formal policy, program or plan that requires us to award equity or equity-based compensation on specific dates, we generally expect our Compensation Committee to approve and grant equity awards to our executive officers annually. Additionally, our insider trading policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from trading in our common stock while in possession of or on the basis of MNPI about us. We have not timed, and do not plan to time, the disclosure of MNPI for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
In the year ended March 31, 2025, the following options were granted to our named executive officers within four business days prior to, or one business day following, the filing or furnishing of a periodic or current report by us that disclosed MNPI.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management The following tables set forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of July 1, 2025 by (i) each of our directors and named executive officers (as disclosed in this Annual Report); (ii) all of our current executive officers and directors as a group; and (iii) each holder of more than 5% of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated in the table or the footnotes to the following table, each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power and such person’s address is c/o VivoSim Labs, Inc., 11555 Sorrento Valley Rd., Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92121. We determined the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each person under rules promulgated by the SEC, based on information obtained from Company records and filings with the SEC on or before July 1, 2025. In cases of holders who are not directors or named executive officers, Schedules 13G or 13D filed with the SEC, as applicable (and, consequently, ownership reflected here), often reflect holdings as of a date prior to July 1, 2025. The information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares which the individual or entity had the right to acquire within 60 days of July 1, 2025. These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or entity. Applicable percentages are based on 2,599,797 shares of common stock outstanding as of July 1, 2025, as adjusted as required by the rules promulgated by the SEC. We have deemed shares of our common stock subject to stock options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of July 1, 2025, or issuable pursuant to restricted stock units that are subject to vesting conditions expected to occur within 60 days of July 1, 2025, to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock option or restricted stock units for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or entity.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Board Independence Our shares of common stock are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, our Board utilizes the definition of “independence” as that term is defined by the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the additional independence requirements for members of our Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Our Board considers a director “independent” when the director is not an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, does not have any relationship which would, or could reasonably appear to, materially interfere with the independent judgment of such director, and the director otherwise meets the independence requirements under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our Board has reviewed the materiality of any relationship that each of our directors has with the Company, either directly or indirectly. Based on this review, our Board has affirmatively determined that the following four of our five current directors qualify as “independent” directors: Douglas Jay Cohen, David Gobel, Alison Tjosvold Milhous and Adam Stern. Keith Murphy does not qualify as an independent director. Mr. Murphy currently serves as our Executive Chairman and as Chief Executive Officer of Viscient, which has made payments to the Company in sufficient amounts to qualify as related party transactions leading to director non-independence. Please see the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” for additional information. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Since April 1, 2024, there have not been any transactions or series of similar transactions to which we were or are a party in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at fiscal year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any of our directors or executive officers, any holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than (i) the transactions described below and (ii) the compensation arrangements with our executive officers and non-employee directors described in “Executive Compensation” and “Director Compensation,” respectively. Intercompany Agreement with Viscient Viscient is an entity for which Keith Murphy, our Executive Chairman and member of our Board, serves as the Chief Executive Officer and President. Messrs. Stern, Cohen and Gobel (through the Methuselah Foundation and the Methuselah Fund) have invested funds through a convertible promissory note in Viscient, but do not serve as an employee, officer or director of Viscient. On December 28, 2020, the Company entered into an intercompany agreement (the “Intercompany Agreement”) with Viscient and Organovo, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, which included an asset purchase agreement for certain lab equipment. Pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement, the Company agreed to provide Viscient certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, which includes, but is not limited to, histology services, cell isolation, and proliferation of cells and Viscient agreed to provide the Company certain services related to 3D bioprinting technology, including bioprinter training, bioprinting services, and qPCR assays, in each case on payment terms specified in the Intercompany Agreement and as may be further determined by the parties. In addition, the Company and Viscient each agreed to share certain facilities and equipment, and, subject to further agreement, to each make certain employees available for specified projects for the other party at prices to be determined in good faith by the parties. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and first quarter of fiscal 2026, the companies added Statements of Work to the Intercompany Agreement, pursuant to which Viscient agreed to provide the Company with certain testing services related to the Company's ongoing research and development ("R&D"). The Company evaluated the accounting for the Intercompany Agreement and concluded that any services provided by Viscient to the Company will be expensed as incurred, and any compensation for services provided by the Company to Viscient will be considered a reduction of personnel related expenses. Any services provided to Viscient do not fall under Financial Accounting Standards Board Topic 606 (“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) as the Intercompany Agreement is not a contract with a customer. For the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company incurred $118,000 in R&D consulting expenses from Viscient. The Company did not incur any consulting expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Additionally, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company provided approximately $3,000 and $14,000 of histology services to Viscient, respectively.
Related Party Transaction Policy and Procedures Pursuant to our written Related Party Transaction Policy and Procedures, our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, including their immediate family members and affiliates, are prohibited from entering into a related party transaction with us without the prior consent of our Audit Committee or a committee of our independent directors.
Any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, principal stockholder, or any of such persons’ immediate family members or affiliates, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, must first be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration and approval.
In
16
approving or rejecting the proposed agreement, our Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant, including, but not limited to, the terms of the transaction, the nature of the related party’s interest in the transaction, the significance of the transaction to us and the related party, the nature of the related party’s relationship with us and whether the transaction would be likely to impair (or create an appearance of impairing) the judgement of a director or executive officer to act in our best interest.
Our Audit Committee shall approve only those agreements that, in light of known circumstances, are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests, as our Audit Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.
On July 18, 2023, Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. (“MHM”) informed us and the Audit Committee that it would not stand for re-election as our registered public accounting firm for the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. MHM served as our independent registered public accounting firm from February 8, 2011 through August 10, 2023. Our Audit Committee is responsible for, and, has approved, the engagement of Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman P.A. ("RRBB P.A.") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. RRBB P.A. has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since August 31, 2023. The audit reports of RRBB P.A. on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for an explanatory paragraph regarding the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
During our two most recent fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no (a) disagreements, within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Regulation S-K”), and the related instructions thereto, with RRBB P.A. or MHM on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of RRBB P.A. or MHM, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports, or (b) reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto. Audit and Non-Audit Fees During Fiscal 2025, the Audit Committee met with RRBB P.A. on a quarterly or more frequent basis thereafter. During Fiscal 2024, the Audit Committee met with MHM during the first quarter and RRBB P.A. on a quarterly or more frequent basis thereafter.
At such times, the Audit Committee reviewed the services performed by RRBB P.A. and MHM, as well as the fees charged for such services.  The following table sets forth the fees for services provided and billed by RRBB P.A. relating to Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permitted Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee has determined that all services provided by RRBB P.A. to date are compatible with maintaining the independence of such audit firm.
The charter of the Audit Committee requires advance approval of all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to any exception permitted by law or regulation.
The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the
