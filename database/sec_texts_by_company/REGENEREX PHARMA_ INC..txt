PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business of Issuer
Company Overview
Regenerex Pharma, Inc. (the "Company" or "Regenerex Pharma") specializes in the development and commercialization of advanced wound care healing products. The Company operates through three distinct proprietary technologies designed to address different wound care needs:
1.
Chronic Wound Closure Technology - Specifically designed for closing chronic wounds
2.
Acute Wound Acceleration Technology - Focused on accelerating closure of acute or surgical wounds
3.
Contamination Control Technology - Addresses contamination issues across all wound types, including biofilm destruction
Product Portfolio
The Company's comprehensive Wound Closure System and protocols effectively treat a broad spectrum of wounds, including diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, burns, and surgical wounds. These innovative products position Regenerex to capture significant market share in both domestic and international markets.
Core Technology: QBx™
The Company's proprietary active ingredient, QBx™, addresses a critical issue in wound healing by down-regulating the production of specific proteases and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Medical and scientific consensus has established that elevated protease levels significantly impede wound healing, with approximately 80% of chronic wounds displaying elevated protease levels, including MMPs.
Current Products
1.
Xcellderma™ OTC - Liquid Bandage Skin Protectant
a.
Sterile wound dressing effective for treating wounds, skin irritations, cuts, and abrasions
b.
Available as an over-the-counter solution
2.
Accelerex™ Sterile Wound Cream
a.
First commercially available medical device containing QBx™
b.
Designed for treating chronic and acute wounds including:
o
Diabetic ulcers
o
Burns
o
Pressure ulcers (stages I-IV)
o
Venous stasis ulcers
•

6
Market Opportunity
Clinical Efficacy
QBx™ represents the most efficacious, clinically proven chronic wound care technology globally. The Company's Wound Closure System has demonstrated remarkable success in clinical trials, achieving closure rates of up to 95% of non-responding chronic wounds within 90 days. Notably, these tested wounds had previously failed to respond to conventional treatment protocols.
Market Need
Chronic wounds represent a significant healthcare challenge characterized by:
•
Failure to progress through normal healing sequences
•
Delayed healing lasting weeks, months, or years
•
Resistance to conventional dressings and therapies
•
Substantial financial and quality-of-life burden on patients
•
Frustration for caregivers and clinicians
These wounds typically become trapped in a catabolic, inflammatory phase hostile to growth factors and cellular repair mechanisms. Traditional treatments using gauze and modern dressings (hydrocolloids, collagens) fail to address the underlying cellular environment, creating a significant market opportunity.
Economic Impact
Chronic wounds impose substantial costs on the U.S. healthcare system:
•
Nearly seven million Americans currently live with chronic wounds
•
One in four families has a member with a chronic wound
•
3% of individuals over 65 have open wounds
•
Growing prevalence due to aging population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity
Regulatory and Market Environment
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has fundamentally changed wound care reimbursement structures, transitioning all market segments—hospitals, nursing homes, home health, and wound care clinics—to pay-for-performance models. This shift creates significant opportunities for cost-effective, high-performance solutions like the Company's Wound Closure System.
Home health providers now receive single diagnostic code payments, transferring financial risk from payees to payers. The Company is strategically targeting market segments operating under these "at-risk" payment models, with home health and nursing homes representing the fastest-growing segments due to demographic trends.
7
Operations and Manufacturing
The Company has established manufacturing capabilities through:
•
Purchase of proprietary wound care formulations
•
Lease agreement dated June 10, 2023, with Woundcare Labs, LLC for plant and equipment in Tennessee
•
Current FDA clearance for Xcellderma™ manufacturing
•
Ongoing FDA re-certification process for drug and medical device manufacturing
Strategic Initiatives
Domestic Market Development
Management is actively developing managed care agreements with southeastern states to manage Medicaid wound care patients. These partnerships would provide the Company's Wound Closure System, products, and protocols, resulting in substantial cost savings for state Medicaid programs.
International Expansion
The Company is pursuing distribution opportunities in Asian and Middle Eastern markets through negotiations with regional distributors.
UAE Market Development Agreement:
•
Agreement dated June 11, 2023, with First Forte Consultancy (UAE)
•
Total value: $45,000
•
Services: Meeting facilitation and roadshows for potential distribution clients
•
Payment structure: $22,500 paid June 15, 2023; balance due upon completion
•
Expected completion: Fiscal year ending March 31, 2026
Competitive Advantage
Regenerex Pharma maintains significant competitive advantages through:
•
Proprietary QBx™ technology with proven clinical efficacy
•
Superior closure rates compared to existing solutions
•
Cost-effective treatment protocols
•
Comprehensive product portfolio addressing multiple wound types
•
Strategic positioning within evolving reimbursement landscape
•
Manufacturing capabilities and regulatory compliance
Executive Leadership
Regenerex Pharma Inc. maintains a comprehensive C-suite leadership structure comprising the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Development Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Clinical Director, Chief Research & Development Officer, Chief Creative Officer, and Vice President of International Operations.
8
Corporate Facilities and Real Estate
The Company operates under a strategic leasing model for its facilities. The primary corporate headquarters is located at 114 Main Street, Gordonsville, TN 38653, This property is secured through a lease agreement, allowing for operational flexibility and capital preservation.
We have an identity office at 5348 Vegas Drive #177, Las Vegas, Nevada 89108.
Manufacturing Operations
Regenerex Pharma Inc. employs an asset-light manufacturing strategy, utilizing leased production equipment and facilities rather than capital-intensive ownership. Current lease arrangements for production infrastructure extend through June 30, 2028, providing operational stability while maintaining financial flexibility.
Market Strategy and Distribution
Healthcare Partnerships
Management is actively developing managed care agreements with southeastern state governments to provide comprehensive wound care management for Medicaid populations. The Company's integrated Wound Closure System encompasses proprietary products, clinical protocols, and software solutions designed to deliver significant cost savings for state Medicaid programs.
International Expansion
The Company is pursuing strategic partnerships with distributors across Asian and Middle Eastern markets to expand global market penetration and diversify revenue streams.
Revenue Diversification
Regenerex anticipates generating revenue from multiple healthcare sectors, including:
•
U.S. Government-funded home care service providers
•
State Medicaid Programs
•
International Healthcare Programs
•
Veterans Administration
•
Correctional facility healthcare systems
•
Home Health Care Providers
•
Medicare reimbursement programs
Competitive Positioning
Wound Closure System Technology
Regenerex's proprietary Wound Closure System creates an optimal healing environment for wound closure through advanced biotechnology. The Company's unique approach addresses chronic, non-healing wounds through protease down-regulation and comprehensive wound bed preparation.
QBx™ Platform
The QBx™ technology represents a breakthrough in wound care, uniquely positioned in the market for its ability to successfully treat chronic, non-healing wounds through protease down-regulation. Unlike conventional wound dressings such as hydrocolloids and collagens that merely absorb wound fluids, Regenerex's solutions actively modify the cellular environment rather than simply providing protective coverage.
Market Differentiation
The Company maintains a significant competitive advantage as no other currently available products successfully heal chronic, non-healing wounds through the Company's proprietary mechanisms of action.
9
Intellectual Property Portfolio
Patent Protection
Regenerex has secured primary patent rights for its Wound Closure System and Wound Care Platform. The Company maintains two additional patents pending for antimicrobial properties and acceleration of acute and surgical wound healing.
Trademark Portfolio

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS.
The Company will face competition from existing consumer
product companies.
We are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the
reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will
make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, following an IPO, or
sale of the Company’s securities under a registration statement. However, if our non-convertible debt
issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1.07 billion,
or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds
$700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given
fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the
following fiscal year. As an
emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements and we are exempt from the requirements of holding
a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth
company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies
until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common
stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some
investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there
may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be
more volatile.
The Company
has a lack of revenue history and has had a limited history of operations.
The Company was formed on November 18, 2005, for the purpose of engaging
in any lawful business and had adopted a plan to engage in the sale of artwork
over the internet. The Company had
minimal revenues. On July 29, 2010,
the Company changed its name from Online Originals, Inc. to CREENERGY
Corporation. The name change was
intended to convey a sense of the Company's new business focus as it looked to
pursue other opportunities. Specifically,
the Company intended to obtain leases for the exploration and production of oil
and gas in northern Alberta, Canada. The Company was unable to identify any
prospects or enter into any leases or agreements.
On August 23, 2011, the Company
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire intangible assets and
intellectual property known as the Peptide Technology Platform. The Peptide Technology Platform included
the technology platforms for developing a variety of drug candidates and
biological solutions for existing problems in humans, animals, and the
environment. Effective October 12,
2011, the Company changed its name to Peptide Technologies, Inc.
Effective January 10, 2017, the Company changed its name to Eternelle
Skincare Products Inc. to better convey the Company’s new business focus of
developing and marketing skincare products.
Effective February
28, 2018, the Company changed
its name back to Peptide
Technologies, Inc. to better convey
the broader potential of the Company.
On November 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement in which the Company purchased certain intellectual property in exchange for 150,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and up to $10,000,000 in contingent
consideration to be paid at the rate of 15% of all gross revenues received from
sales or investment money into the Company, payable on the 15th of the following month, for a period
of 60 months.
Effective November 29, 2021, the Company changed its name to Regenerex
Pharma, Inc., to better convey the Company’s new business focus.
On August 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase
Technology Platforms in which the Company purchased certain intellectual
property in exchange for a two million four hundred thousand dollars
($2,400,000) interest-free note due August 17, 2024. The note payable was due within twelve
(12) months of the date of the agreement. If
the Company has not raised a minimum of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in
sales within twelve (12) months, or a minimum of ten million dollars
($10,000,000) in investment, the seller will extend the payments for a further
period of twelve (12) months for a 10% payment of the outstanding balance.  The note has been extended and is now due
August 17, 2025.
11
The Company received all rights and title to proprietary wound healing
technologies platforms and formulas involving the application of wound care
protocols to treat all wounds, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns
and surgical wounds. These unique
products strategically position the Company to enter and capture a high
proportionate market share in the U.S.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company is not profitable. The Company must be regarded as a start-up
venture with all the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, risks, and
difficulties to which such ventures are subject.
The Company can give no assurance of success or profitability to the Company’s investors.
There is no assurance that the Company will ever operate profitably. There is no assurance that the Company
will generate substantial revenues or profits, or that the market price of the
Company’s common stock will increase thereby.
The
Company will need additional financing for which it has no commitments, and
this may jeopardize the execution of the Company’s business plan.
The Company has limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate to
carry out its business plan. The
Company’s ultimate success depends upon its ability to raise additional
capital. The Company has not
investigated the availability, source, or terms that might govern the
acquisition of additional capital and will not do so until it determines a need
for additional financing. If the
Company needs additional capital, it
has no assurance that funds will be available from any source or, if available,
that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company. If not available, the Company’s operations
will be limited to those that can be financed with its modest capital.
The
Company will incur expenses in
connection with its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing
requirements and may not be able to meet such costs, which could jeopardize its
filing status with the SEC.
As a public reporting company, the Company is required to meet the filing
requirements of the SEC. The Company
may see an increase in its legal, accounting, auditing and fees and expenses as
a result of such requirements. Our
costs will increase significantly as the Company expands operations. Our filings are subject to comment from
the SEC on its filings and/or it is required to file supplemental filings for
transactions and activities. If the
Company is not compliant in meeting the filing requirements of the SEC, it
could lose its status as a 1934 Act
Company, which could compromise its ability to raise funds.
The Company is not diversified,
and it is dependent on only one business.
Because of the Company’s limited financial resources, it is unlikely that
it will be able to diversify its operations.
The Company’s probable inability to diversify its activities into more
than one area will subject it to economic fluctuations within the industry and
therefore increase the
risks associated with the Company’s operations due to lack of diversification.
The
Company may in the future issue more shares, which could cause a loss of
control by its present management and current stockholders.
The Company may issue additional shares as consideration for cash,
assets, or services out of its authorized, but unissued, common stock that
would, upon issuance, represent a majority of the voting power and equity of
the Company. The result of such an
issuance would be that those new
stockholders would control the Company, and unknown persons could replace the
Company’s management. Such an
occurrence would result in a greatly reduced percentage of ownership of the
Company by its current shareholders, which could present significant risks to investors.
12
The Company will depend upon its management, but it will have limited
participation of management.
The Company currently
has four individuals who are serving
as its officers and directors. The Company will be heavily
dependent upon their skills,
talents, and abilities, as well as several consultants, to implement the
Company’s business plan. The Company
may, from time to time, find that the inability of its officers, directors, and
consultants to devote their full-time attention to the Company’s business
results in a delay in progress toward implementing its business plan.
The Company does not know of any reason, other than outside business
interests, that would prevent them from devoting their attention full- time to
the Company when the business may demand such full-time participation.
The
departure of key personnel could compromise the Company’s ability to execute
its strategic plan and may result in additional severance costs.
The Company’s success largely depends on the skills, experience, and
efforts of its key personnel. The
loss of these persons, or the Company’s
failure to retain other key personnel, would jeopardize its ability to execute
its strategic plan and materially harm its business.
The Company will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow its business.
The Company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to
attract and retain qualified operations, marketing, sales, and engineering
personnel. Inability to attract and
retain such personnel could adversely affect business growth. The Company expects to face competition in
the recruitment of qualified personnel and cannot provide any assurance that it
will attract or retain such personnel.
The regulation of penny
stocks by the SEC and FINRA
may discourage the tradability
of the Company’s securities.
The Company is a “penny stock” company.
None of its securities currently trade in any market and, if ever
available for trading, will be subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission
rule that imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who
sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited
investors. For purposes of the rule,
the phrase “accredited investors” means, in general terms, institutions with
assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000
(excluding a primary residence) or
having an annual income that exceeds $200,000 (or that, when combined with a
spouse’s income, exceeds $300,000). For transactions covered by the rule, the
broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser
and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to the
sale. Effectively, this discourages
broker-dealers from executing trades in penny stocks. Consequently, the rule will affect the ability of shareholders
to sell their securities in any market that might develop because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on
penny stock transactions.
In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number
of rules to regulate “penny stocks." Such
rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7,
and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Because
the Company’s securities constitute “penny stocks” within the meaning of the
rules, the rules would apply to the Company and its securities. The rules will further affect the ability
of owners of shares to sell the Company’s securities in any market that might
develop for them because it imposes additional regulatory burdens on penny
stock transactions.
Shareholders should be aware that, according to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years
from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such
patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few
broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii)
manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and
false and misleading press releases; (iii) “boiler room” practices involving
high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced
sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups
by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and
broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired consequent
investor losses. The Company’s
management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny
stock market. Although the Company
does not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of
broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the
confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being
established with respect to the Company’s securities.
13
The
Company’s officers and directors collectively own a substantial portion of its
outstanding common stock, and as long as they do, they may be able to control
the outcome of stockholder voting.
The Company’s officers and directors are collectively the beneficial
owners of approximately 71.230% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. As long as the
Company’s officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of
its common stock, other shareholders may generally be unable to affect or
change the management or the direction of the Company without the support of
its officers and directors. As a result, some investors may be unwilling to
purchase the Company’s common stock. If the demand for the Company’s common
stock is reduced because its officers and directors have significant influence
over the Company, the price of the Company’s common stock could be materially
depressed. The officers and directors will be able to exert significant
influence over the outcome of all
corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and approval of
significant corporate transactions.
The Company may seek to raise additional funds or develop
strategic relationships by issuing
capital stock.
The Company expects to finance its operations and developing strategic
relationships, by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could
significantly reduce or dilute the percentage ownership of existing
stockholders. Furthermore, any newly
issued securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to
those of existing stock. Moreover,
any issuances of equity securities may be at the prevailing market price of the
Company’s stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on investors’
ownership interest, which could cause the market price of stock to decline.
The Company may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of
debt, and the holders of any debt the Company may issue would have rights
superior to investors’ rights in the
event the Company is not successful and is forced to seek the protection of the
bankruptcy laws.
The Company will pay no
foreseeable dividends in the future.
The Company has not paid
dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying such dividends in
the foreseeable future.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
None.
ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.
The Company’s cyber risk management strategy has consisted of a focus on
minimizing our attach surface and leveraging industry standard cyber threat
prevention, detection, and remediation tools.
The Company assesses cyber security risk as follows:
•
We have executed
on this strategy
with a cloud-first approach, awareness training, and deliberate use of well-established vendors for software and hardware solutions.
•
The Company’s IT manager is engaging an independent service
with its expertise
specifically in cybersecurity and risk mitigation to
review our IT as a risk service consultant.
To date, no cybersecurity threats have materially affected our business
strategy, operations, or financial condition.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
The Company does not own its own facilities and is presently renting an identity
office in Las Vegas, Nevada,
a plant facility
in Memphis Tennessee and corporate office in Gordonsville,
TN.
TEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
None.
ITEM 4. MINING SAFETY DISCLOSURES

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.
This Item is not required for
smaller reporting companies, and the Company has elected to omit this information.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Plan of Operation
The Company’s business is to develop
and market Woundcare
Healing products.
New Developments
Regenerex Pharma Inc. has entered
a pivotal phase of strategic expansion, with multiple initiatives underway to
strengthen our market position and operational capabilities. Our business
development team has made significant progress in negotiations with our first State
Medicaid program. These contracts represent potential annual revenue streams
exceeding $100 million. Simultaneously, we are actively engaging with major
private insurance networks to secure preferred provider status, which would
expand our patient access tremendously. On the organizational front, we've
successfully recruited Kenneth W. Perry as
our new Chief Financial Officer bringing 40
years of healthcare industry experience that will prove invaluable
as we scale. The lab re-certification process for drug manufacturing is underway.  Perhaps most exciting is our development of a
proprietary AI-driven information system that promises to revolutionize our
approach to wound management, patient adherence tracking, and personalized
medication protocols. This system, developed in partnership with Optimize
Health Partners, will integrate real-time patient data, using artificial intelligence, to while improve
clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The
competitive advantage this creates cannot be overstated, as it positions
Regenerex Pharma as not just a manufacturer but a comprehensive healthcare
solutions provider with data-driven insights that our competitors simply cannot
match.
15
The Company received all rights and title to proprietary wound healing
technologies platforms and formulas involving the application of wound care
protocols to treat all wounds, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns
and surgical wounds. These unique
products strategically position the Company to enter and capture a high
proportionate market share in the U.S.
Chronic wounds impose significant costs to the US economy. Chronic wounds are a growing issue in the
United States, causing immense patient pain and suffering as well as
substantial economic and social cost. Although
precise information on the prevalence of chronic wounds in the US is
unavailable, it is estimated that, as of 2021, there were more than 8.3 million Americans suffering from chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are generally defined as
wounds that have not healed after ninety days of consistent clinical treatment,
and include diabetic foot ulcers,
pressure ulcers (bedsores), and venous stasis ulcers, however this does not
include acute wounds.
The most common chronic wounds are diabetic foot ulcers and pressure
ulcers. The increasing number of
Americans with diabetes and obesity
we well as the aging population will likely cause the number of individuals
with chronic wounds to continue to rise. In
addition to the immeasurable human benefits of improving treatment outcomes,
there would be substantial economic effect. The
costs of medical treatment could be expected to decrease, and, as patients are
able to return to work sooner, productivity would increase.
The Company has three technologies for different
types of wound conditions:
•
The first is for closing
chronic wounds,
•
the second is for accelerating closure
of acute or surgical wounds,
and
•
the third solves the issue on contamination of all
types of wounds including
the destruction of biofilms.
The current product technology provides the Company with a number of
complete wound care protocols to treat all wounds, such as diabetic ulcers,
pressure ulcers, burns and surgical wounds. These
unique products strategically position the Company to enter and capture a high
proportionate market share in the U.S. and global markets.
Currently, there are no products available on the market that are
successful in healing chronic, non-healing wounds through the down regulation
of proteases. Management believes
that this will provide the Company with a distinct advantage over other
companies providing services in this sector.
The wound care healing space is well suited for Home Care service
providers that are funded by the US Government. The majority of manufacturing and distribution will be
outsourced. However, strategic
planning and development will be performed internally by the Company.
Due to the staggering costs associated with chronic wounds in the US, the
Affordable Healthcare Act (AHA) is changing how the entire wound care system is reimbursed in the US.
Now all four markets segments: hospital, nursing homes, home health, and
general wound care clinics are all on paid on a “pay for performance basis.” These cost pressures in the healthcare
system are a major issue in the wound care market, with the US government and
payors seeking new approaches that address cost constraints and product
performance. Home health is now paid
on a “diagnostic code” for the wound in single payments removing the risk from
the Payee to the Payer. The Company’s
first markets will be those segments that are totally “at risk” for single
payments to close the wounds. Today,
the fastest growing segment in the US
wound market is Home Health and Nursing Homes due to the aging population.
Currently management is engaged in developing
managed care agreements with southeastern states to manage their Medicaid wound
care patients. Regenerex would
provide our wound care products and protocols which would result in a large
savings for the state Medicaid population. The
Company is also in the process of
negotiating with several distributors in various Asian and Middle
Eastern countries to provide the Company's products.
16
Results of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
At present, the Company has no revenue. Net loss decreased to $2,527,041
for the year ended March 31, 2025 from $3,543,827   for
the year ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in research and
development.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have
been notes payable and proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants of $2,500,000 during
the year
ended March 31, 2025.  The Company requires significant cash to
launch its business and reduce its liabilities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. We
are actively seeking to raise additional debt and/or equity capital to add new
products and/or services to commence material operations. If the Company is unable to raise
additional capital in the near future or meet financing requirements, the
Company may need to curtail or alter its plan of operation. Our independent registered public
accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report regarding
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company is currently looking to raise an
additional $500,000 by the end of July, to provide adequate cash until
contracts start.
Cash Flow
The following table summarizes,
for the periods indicated, selected items in our Statements of Cash Flows:
Year Ended March 31,

(6,299)
Financing activities
$         2,279,232
$           463,084
Cash used in operating activities was $1,625,351 and $457,548
for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in cash
used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease research and
development.
Loss from Theft
On March 12, 2025, a sophisticated hacking group was able to hack one of
our bank accounts.  The original amount
taken was $399,680, which is a material loss for the Company.  A small amount $15,772 was recovered, we are
working to recover an additional portion of the funds lost.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $1,228 and $6,299 for the years
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The decrease
in cash used was a result of fewer investments in fixed assets for the period.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities was $2,279,232
and $463,084 for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The
increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an
increase in proceeds from sale of common stock and cash received from notes payable.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
17
Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management
to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The Company’s
accounting policies are disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying financial
statements.
Estimates are used in the valuation of warrants and shares issued for
stock-based compensation as disclosed in Notes 3 and 9. Determining the grant
date fair value of the shares of common stock as well as warrants using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires managements to make assumptions and
judgements. These estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and, if different assumptions had been used, stock-based
compensation expense could have been materially different from the amounts
recorded.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company’s market risk arises primarily from exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates and exchange rates. The
Company presently only transacts business in Canadian and U.S. Dollars. Management believes that the exchange rate
risk surrounding future transactions of the Company will not materially or
adversely affect the Company’s future earnings. Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any
seasonal trends. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments to manage risks or for speculative or
trading purposes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the board
of directors of Regenerex Pharma,
Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Regenerex Pharma, Inc.
(the “Company”) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
Company has incurred continuing losses from operations, negative cash flows
from operations, and has negative working capital, which raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding
these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

REGENEREX PHARMA, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – NATURE
OF OPERATIONS
Regenerex Pharma, Inc., formerly Peptide Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”
or “Regenerex”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada, United States of America, on November
18, 2005.
On November 15, 2021, the
Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement in which the Company purchased certain intellectual property in exchange for 150,000,000
of Company common stock shares. In addition, up to $10,000,000 in contingent consideration to be paid at the rate of 15% of all gross
revenues received from sales or investment money into the Company, payable on the 15th
of the following month, for a period of 60 months.
On August 17, 2023, the
Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase Technology Platforms in which the Company purchased certain intellectual property in exchange
for an interest-free two million four hundred thousand dollars ($2,400,000) note payable. The note payable was originally due within 12
months of the date of the agreement, but allowed for an extension for an additional 12 month period for a 10% fee. The extension was taken,
and the renewed note and extension fee are due August 17, 2025.
The Company received all rights and title to proprietary wound healing
technologies platforms and formulas involving the application of wound care
protocols to treat all wounds, such as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, burns
and surgical wounds. These unique
products strategically position the Company to enter and capture a high
proportionate market share in the U.S.
Risks and Uncertainties
Our business and our forward-looking
statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements
regarding the results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The Company has a lack of revenue history and has had a limited history
of operations. No revenue has
historically been derived from the assets purchased. Regenerex can give no assurance of success or profitability to
the Company’s investors.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
These financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which
contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses from operations and continuing negative
cash flows from operations through March 31, 2025. The Company has current liabilities in excess of current assets of $4,270,172. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans are to actively seek capital to enable the Company to
add new products and/or services to ultimately achieve profitability. However, management cannot provide assurance that
they can raise sufficient capital and whether the Company will ultimately
achieve profitability, become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt
and/or equity capital. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital in
the near future or meet financing requirements, management expects that the
Company will need to curtail operations, seek
additional capital on less favorable terms, and/or pursue other remedial
measures.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company become unable to
continue as a going concern.
25
NOTE 3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a)
of the Securities Act, as modified by
the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies
including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the
independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on
executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS
Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with
new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is,
those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of
securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the
new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS
Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended
transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging
growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company
has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for
public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can
adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make
comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has
opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible
because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could ultimately differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is reported in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 260 “Earnings per Share” which requires dual presentation of basic earnings
per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS on the face of all statements of earnings, for all entities with complex capital structures.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through the exercise or conversion of stock
options, restricted stock awards, warrants and convertible securities. In certain circumstances, the conversion of those options, warrants
and convertible securities are excluded from diluted EPS if the effect of such inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Fully diluted EPS is
not provided when the effect is anti-dilutive. When the effect of dilution on loss per share is anti-dilutive, diluted loss per share
equals the loss per share.
During
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company excluded the outstanding stock warrants from its calculation of earnings per share,
as the warrants would be anti-dilutive. As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had common shares warrants outstanding of 5,675,355
and 2,608,250.
Website
Expenditures
related to the planning and operation of the Company’s website are expensed as incurred. Expenditures related to the website application
and infrastructure development are capitalized and amortized over the website’s estimated useful life of three (3) years. Amortization
expense for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $1,328 and $2,875, respectively.  It is now fully depreciated.
26
Furniture
and Computer Equipment
Furniture
and computer equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of three (3) to five (5) years. Depreciation expense for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $1,726 and $1,403, respectively. Significant betterments are capitalized while purchases under $500 are expensed as incurred. We purchased two laptops totaling $1,228 in 2025.
Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The
Company has active operating lease arrangements for office space, production equipment, and production facilities. The Company is required
to make fixed minimum rent payments relating to its right to use the underlying leased asset. In accordance with  ASC 842, the Company
recorded right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities for these leases as of March 31, 2025.
The Company’s lease agreements do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Therefore, the Company used a benchmark
approach to derive an incremental
borrowing rate of 10% to discount each of its lease liabilities based on the
remining lease term.
Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
The long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for
impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability is performed. There
were no impairment losses during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Revenue Recognition
The Company will record revenue under ASC
606, by 1) identifying the contract with the customer 2) identifying the
performance obligations in the contract 3) determining the transaction price,
4) allocating the transaction price to the required performance obligations in
the contract, and 5) recognizing revenue when or as the companies satisfies a
performance obligation.
We expect to generate revenue from home care service providers that are
funded by the U.S. Government, State Medicaid Programs, International Health
Care Programs, Veteran’s administration, Prison system, Home Health Care
Providers, and other applicable Medicare reimbursement models. The Company will defer revenue where the
earnings process is not yet complete. To
date, no revenue has been generated from the asset acquisition.
Share-Based Payments
The Company recognizes the cost of share-based payment awards on a
straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period and over the non-employee’s period
of providing goods or services, net of estimated forfeitures.
Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date
requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to
exercise and the associated volatility. The
Company estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to
be outstanding. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical
volatility of comparable public companies’ common stock for a period approximating the expected life,
and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on US
Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life.
27
The fair value of
restricted stock awards is based
on the fair value of the
Company’s common stock on the date
of the grant.
Research and Development
We incur research and development costs during the process of researching
and developing additional technologies purchased and future manufacturing
processes. Our research and
development costs consist primarily of the purchase of additional intellectual
property that we will use in the
development of our planned product. We
expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed,
tested, and made ready for commercial use.
Income Taxes
Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory income tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized.
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting
guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair
value that maximizes the use of observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that
market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are
developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions
about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or
liability. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value:
•
Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for
identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 - Includes other inputs that are directly or indirectly
observable in the marketplace.
•
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs
which are supported by little or no market activity.
The Company’s financial instruments include accounts payable and accrued
compensation. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair
value because of their short-term nature.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.
Foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to their
U.S. dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Related translation
adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity,
whereas gains or losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board Issues Accounting Standards
Updates (“ASU”) to amend the authoritative literature in the Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”). There have been a number of ASUs to date that
amend the original text of the ASC. The Company believes those updates issued
to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical
corrections, (iii) are not applicable to
the Company, or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company. The following are recent accounting pronouncements which may impact
the Company:
28
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU 2023-09”) amending existing income tax
disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income
taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption
permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. The
Company is currently evaluating this ASU
to determine its impact on the Company’s income tax disclosures.
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU 2023-07”) amending existing
segment disclosure guidance, primarily requiring quarterly disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the
Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), requiring disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of
how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023,  with early adoption permitted. ASU should be
applied on a retroactive basis, to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently following ASU 2033-07
and making the required disclosures.
In
October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU 2023-06”) amending the
disclosure or presentation requirements for a variety of Topics. Many of the amendments align the requirements in the Codification with
the SEC’s regulations. The ASU is effective on the date on which the SEC removes the related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation
S- K, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is disclosing the relevant information in this filing.
In
March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU 2023-01”) amending guidance
for lessees that are party to a lease between entities under common control. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. It must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently in compliance
with reporting under this ASU.
As new
accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are
applicable under the circumstances.
Management believes those updates issued-to-date either (i) provide
supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable
to the Company, or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company.

NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
On
November 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement in which the Company purchased certain intellectual property
in exchange for 150,000,000 of Company common stock.  In addition, up to $10,000,000 in contingent consideration to be paid at the
rate of 15% of all gross revenues received from sales or investment money into the Company, payable on the 15th of the following month,
for a period of 60 months. This rate was amended by the Board of Directors in January 2025 to 25% from all investment money raised.
On
August 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase Technology Platforms in which the Company purchased certain intellectual
property in exchange for a two million four hundred thousand dollars ($2,400,000) note payable. The intellectual property that was purchased
requires further development prior to the product being finalized and produced so it has been expensed as research and development. The

As of March 31, 2025, the weighted average remaining lease term was 3.2 years. Lease liabilities are
amortized using the effective interest method using a discount rate of 10%. Depreciation of ROU asset is calculated as
the difference between the expected straight-line rent expense over the lease
term less the accretion on the lease liability. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability for these operating leases in its Balance Sheet. The office lease and plant facility lease
also includes obligations for the Company to pay for other services, including
utilities and maintenance. The
Company accounts for these services separately.
During the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 the operating lease cost for the plant was $192,771 and
$161,462,

NOTE 9 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT
The Company has authorized the issuance of 675,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001
per share.
During the years ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company issued 295,000
and 720,000
shares, respectively, to board members and consultants for services rendered. Total stock-based compensation expense was $77,100
and $129,600 during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, in connection with these issuances based on the fair value of the stock
on the respective grant dates.
During
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company issued 3,067,105 and 842,000 warrants to board members and consultants
for services rendered with a total grant date fair value of $55,562 and $85,132, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense
of $55,562 and $82,098 , respectively, was recorded in connection with these awards during the years ended March 31, 2025
and 2024. The warrants contain an exercise price of $0.33 per share,
warrants are issued as services are provided and
vest immediately upon issuance. They expire
on dates ranging from July 1, 2029 to April 1, 2031.
The warrant fair values were
estimated using a Black Scholes model with a 5-year
expected term, risk-free interest rate ranging from 4.65%
to 5.48%,
a dividend yield of 0%,
and a volatility of 80.0%.
The risk-free interest rate assumptions for options granted is based upon observed interest rates on the United States government securities
appropriate for the expected term of the equity awards.
As of the date of this valuation, the Company’s stock was not trading. The volatility was calculated based on the
historical volatility of comparable public companies. The Company will continue to monitor peer companies and other
relevant factors used to measure expected volatility for future equipment award
grants, until such time that the Company’s Common Stock has enough market
history to use historical volatility.
The dividend yield assumption
for equity awards granted is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The Company has never declared
or paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock, and the Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
The
closing stock price of the Company’s common stock is not available as the Company’s stock is not trading. As a result, the
Board of Directors and management determined the fair value of the common stock to be $0.50
per
share based upon an allocation of the recent cash price paid for common stock and warrants during the year ended March 31, 2025.
During
the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 343,250 shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.001 for the price of one ($1) dollar per share for
a total of $343,250. Five warrants were issued for each share purchased, for a
total of 1,716,250 warrants. The warrants are exercisable at twenty ($0.20)
cents and expire from April 2025 through September 2025.
During
the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock
with a par value of $0.001 for the price of one ($1) dollar per share for a
total of $50,000. One warrant was issued for each share purchased for a total
of 50,000 warrants. The warrants are exercisable at one dollar ($1.00) and
expire January 19, 2026.
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company issued 2,550,000
shares
of common stock with a par value of $0.001
for
the price of one ($1.00) dollar per share for a total of $2,550,000
less
$250,000 in broker fees. Warrants were issued
for each share purchased, for a total of 2,550,000 warrants. The warrants are exercisable at one dollar ($1.00) per share and expire
in February 2027.
As
of March 31, 2025, 5,675,355 warrants had been issued of which all are vested.  None of the warrants have been exercised.

ranging from 2025 to 2039. Net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018
and later have indefinite
carryforward periods. The future utilization of the net operating losses may
potentially be impacted by IRS Section 382 limitations as a result of the significant change in ownership resulting
from the November 15, 2021 Asset
Purchase Agreement discussed in Note
6.
The Company’s recognized and unrecognized deferred tax assets related to
unused tax losses. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against the
potential deferred tax assets associated with all the loss carryforwards as
their utilization is not considered “more likely than not” at this time.
The Company has recently filed its US federal income tax returns. The Company’s Federal tax filings are
subject to audit since 2016. The
Company does not have an ongoing IRS examination.

NOTE 13 – SEGMENT REPORTING
In accordance with ASC 280, Segment
Reporting (“ASC 280”), we identify our operating segments according to how our business
activities are managed and evaluated. ASC 280 establishes standards for
companies to report financial statement information about operating segments,
products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate
financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Company’s
chief operating decision makers (“CODMs”) in deciding how to allocate resources
and assess performance.
The
CODMs have been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, who review the operating results for the Company as a whole to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance.
Accordingly, management has determined that the Company only
has one operating and reportable segment.
When evaluating the Company’s
performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation the CODMs
review several key metrics, which include the following:

The key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODMs are revenue and operating expenses.
Revenue is monitored by the CODMs to understand the performance of the Company. Operating expenses are reviewed and monitored by the
CODMs to manage and forecast cash. The CODMs also reviews operating costs to manage, maintain and enforce all contractual agreements
to ensure costs are aligned with all agreements and internal budgets.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This
Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations
revered to in those certifications.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(the “SEC”) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. This assessment was based on the framework in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework, management concluded that the Company did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025,
as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f).
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the controls and procedures would meet their objectives.
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer need to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2025.
Management’s Report
on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (b) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (c)
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorization of
management and the Board of Directors, and (d) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal controls for Regenerex Pharma, Inc. were presented and accepted
by the Board as of January 22, 2020. Updated
internal controls were presented and accepted by the Board as of February 27, 2025. In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting were not effective
and that material weaknesses existed in the following area as of March 31, 2025.
36
We employ full
time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address
some of the reporting issues surrounding complex and non-routine transactions.  There are still weaknesses to correct, which
will naturally happen as we grow and have more staff.
Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the designation,
implementation and effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and
our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is
committed to taking further action and implement additional enhancements or
improvements, as necessary.
Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of any
control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of certain events. Limitations inherent in any control system include the
following:
•
Judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
and control and process breakdowns can occur because
of simple errors or
mistakes;
•
Controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in
collusion with others, or by management override;
•
The design of any system of controls is based in part
on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions;
•
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with
associated policies or procedures; and
•
The design of a control
system must reflect
the fact that resources are constrained, and the benefits
of controls must be
considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Any increases to the share reserve require majority stockholder approval.
Shares subject to awards that terminate, expire, or are forfeited become
available for reissuance under the Plan.
Administration is overseen by a compensation committee of two or more
directors appointed by the Board, with all awards requiring Board ratification
for validity. The committee has sole authority to determine award recipients,
types, sizes, terms, timing, and exercise criteria, subject to Board approval.
Fair market value for awards is determined as of the committee's recommendation
date.

The Plan includes standard provisions for award terms with a maximum duration of 10 years (5 years for incentive stock options granted to 10% stockholders). Exercise prices for incentive stock options must equal or exceed fair market value at grant, while all options must be priced at minimum 90% of the per-share price in the immediately preceding stock placement transaction. Performance shares are generally tied to targeted financial performance objectives.
Upon termination of employment, awards generally expire within 180 days (one year for disability, with special provisions for death). Change of control provisions provide for automatic acceleration of vesting and may require award assumption by surviving entities. Awards are generally non-transferable except by will or laws of descent and distribution, with limited exceptions for nonqualified options to family members.
The Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its effective date unless terminated earlier or extended with stockholder approval.
Employment Agreements
The Company has a written
employment agreement with Kenneth Perry, CFO. There are also, several
consulting contracts for executives working part-time, until the Company starts
generating revenue or raises additional capital.
Audit Committee
Presently, the Board of Directors is performing the duties that would
normally be performed by an audit committee.
The Board of Directors intends to form a separate audit committee and is
seeking potential independent directors.
ITEM 12. SECURITY
OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN
BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
MANAGEMENT.
The following table sets forth certain information, as of March 31, 2025,
with respect to any person (including any “group”, as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”)) who is known
to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any
class of the Company’s voting securities, and as to those shares of the
Company’s equity securities beneficially owned by each of its directors, the
executive officers of the Company and all of its directors and executive
officers of the Company and all of
its directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise specified in the table below, such information,
other than information with respect to the directors and officers of the
Company, is based on a review of statements filed, with the Securities and
Exchange commission (the “Commission”) pursuant to Sections 13 (d), 13 (f), and
13 (g) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company’s common stock. As of March 31, 2025, there were 281,070,910 shares of common stock
outstanding.
The number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each person is
determined under the rules of the Commission, and the information is not
necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership
includes any shares as to which such person has sole or shared voting power or
investment power and also any shares which the individual has the right to
acquire within 60 days after the date hereof, through the exercise of any stock
option, warrant or other right. Unless
otherwise indicated, each person has sole investment and voting power (or
shares such power with his or her spouse) with respect to the shares set forth
in the following table. The inclusion
herein of any shares deemed beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership
of those shares.
The table also shows the number of shares beneficially owned as of March
31, 2025, by each of the individual directors and executive officers and by all
directors and executive officers as a group.

As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company did not have a standing
audit committee serving, and as a result our board of directors performs the
duties of an audit committee. Our
board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance, the scope and cost of
the engagement of an auditor before the auditor renders audit and non-audit
services. We do not rely on
pre-approval policies and procedures.
