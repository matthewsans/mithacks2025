BUSINESS General Overview History GPO Plus, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016, under the name Koldeck, Inc. for the purpose of operating a publishing business providing services of professional ghost writers, content writers, editors, and publishers. We have since changed our business model and are now operating as a publicly traded global holding company of industry specific group purchasing organizations (GPOs), presently trading under the stock symbol GPOX. Our business and corporate headquarters address is 3571 E. Sunset Road, Suite 300, Las Vegas, NV 89120, and our telephone number is 702-840-1020. Our corporate website is gpoplus.com and our section for shareholders is gpoplus.com/ir. We do not have any subsidiaries as of the date of this Annual Report. The Company Our Current Business GPOPlus+ (GPOX) GPOPlus+ “GPOX” is a leading Direct Store Delivery “DSD” distribution company pioneering the future of distribution to convenience stores and gas stations with its technology-driven distribution model.  3Table of Contents  Our strategic approach involves a close collaboration with retailers to curate a tailored selection of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) that cater to the specific needs of their customer base. By visiting our retail partners weekly, we ensure that shelves are consistently stocked with the most sought-after products, maintaining optimal inventory levels, and maximizing retail success. This partnership extends to working directly with manufacturers and vendors, enhancing our product lineup, and, in some cases, creating our own branded products to fill market gaps. Our in-house technology platform, PRISM+, is at the core of our operations, designed to streamline the distribution process. PRISM+ supports efficient delivery, inventory management, data analytics, and overall operational excellence, enabling us to reliably and effectively meet the dynamic needs of our partners. Overview GPOX is pioneering the future of distribution to convenience stores and gas stations with our groundbreaking DSD distribution model. Our technology-driven distribution network is strategically designed to optimize effectiveness and maximize reach through a network of Regional Hubs and Mini Hubs. This innovative structure enhances our efficiency and service quality, setting a new benchmark for excellence in the distribution industry. Understanding our retail partners' critical needs and challenges, we work closely with them to identify pain points and devise tailored solutions that exceed their expectations! Our commitment to distribution superiority is mirrored in our approach to product selection. We align product offerings with consumer demand by identifying the most relevant and sought-after items; we collaborate with best-in-class vendors, manufacturers, and brands to curate an exceptional product lineup. In some cases, GPOX manufactures products, ensuring our market-leading portfolio remains diverse, exclusive, highly profitable, and in demand. This unique approach enables us to deliver unparalleled value to our retail partners, ensuring that their shelves are consistently stocked with the products consumers want the most. GPOX is not just a distributor; we are a partner invested in the success of our clients. Our rapid growth is a testament to the effectiveness of our DSD model and the trust placed in us by some of the country's largest convenience store and gas station chains. Over the last year, we discovered that a few distributors deliver 80% - 85% of products in convenience stores and gas stations, while the remaining 15% - 20% is handled by numerous regional vendors using a drop-ship model. Our mission is to consolidate this fragmented 15% - 20% market, leveraging our extensive service area, our weekly DSD service, and approaching independent store operators to gain a significant competitive advantage. We are deeply committed to perfecting every aspect of our DSD distribution service. We believe in the power of getting it right - building a scalable, robust business model that can expand without sacrificing quality. Our strategy to achieve this encompasses all distribution aspects, from customer service provided by our drivers to efficient warehouse operations to full technology implementation. While pursuing perfection, our strategy includes onboarding new customers in our existing service area and doing so until we get it right! We have invested time, money, and resources to build the infrastructure for a highly scalable business model capable of nationwide expansion, not just facilitating our current customer base. Once we have solidified our operations and ensured the success of these partnerships, we will set our sights on 2025 and beyond, aiming to scale up to serve over 20,000 locations nationwide. Industry Background: How BIG is Our Target Market? In 2023, the United States boasted approximately 152,396 convenience stores and gas stations, with single-store operators making up 96,161 (63.1%) of these establishments, indicating a strong presence of independent ownership within the market. We empower independent retailers with the same level of service and pricing as large chains. Total industry revenues approached $860 Billion for the year, with $532.2 Billion derived from motor fuel sales and $327.6 Billion from in-store sales, highlighting the significant revenue potential beyond just fuel.  4Table of Contents  Our Target Market Over the last year, we learned that 80% - 85% of all the products you see in convenience stores and gas stations are delivered by just a few distributors. The remaining 15% - 20% is serviced by dozens, in some cases more than 50+ vendors and distributors, with primarily a drop-ship model. Many of these vendors and/or distributors are regional; the larger the convenience store/gas station chain, the fewer vendors they want to work with. Our mission is to consolidate the 15% - 20% of highly fragmented products represented by many vendors and distributors. This is our Target Market, where we have a significant competitive advantage due to our large service area and weekly DSD service! Our Opportunity The opportunity within this sector also lies mainly in the in-store sales domain, which is growing in diversity and volume. As consumer preferences shift towards quick, accessible shopping for a broader range of products, convenience stores are uniquely positioned to meet these demands. This market dynamic presents a fertile ground for companies like GPOX looking to capitalize on the expanding role of convenience stores beyond traditional fuel sales, offering substantial returns on investments in enhancing in-store offerings and customer experience. Getting Really, Really Good at DSD Distribution The GPOX Team is dedicated to perfecting our DSD model by optimizing each aspect of our distribution process to ensure efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction by merging traditional distribution practices with innovative technologies. Our approach focuses on advanced logistics technology, rigorous training for our teams, and strategic partnerships with retailers to streamline the flow of goods directly to stores. This integration ensures high-quality control and supply chain resilience by distributing and manufacturing high-demand products, positioning us as a key player in the convenience retail sector. This unique approach centers around a deep collaboration with retail partners and vendors. We distribute and manufacture high-demand products, making us a pivotal player in the convenience retail ecosystem. This vertical integration allows us to control quality and improve supply chain resilience, providing a consistent and reliable service to all our partners. Our in-house technology platform, PRISM+, is at the forefront of supply chain management, driver management, and maintaining tight control over inventory. It enables precise inventory tracking, optimizes delivery routes, and ensures accurate, timely fulfillment. This reduces overhead costs and increases profitability for GPOX and our partners, distinguishing us as a strategic ally invested in their success. Our in-person direct delivery model cuts operational costs for retailers and strengthens retailer relationships through consistent quality service and customized in-store promotions. As we refine our processes, GPOX is poised to lead in DSD distribution for gas stations and convenience stores, offering unparalleled value to our partners and an enhanced consumer experience. Part of our DSD model is sourcing and manufacturing high quality products with high sales velocity and data analysis to refine an optimal product mix on a store-by-store basis. We continually work with vendors and manufacturing partners to source the best-suited products for our retail partners. When we increase the number of stores we provide distribution services to, we also increase the global footprint of our vendor partner's products, thus increasing their reach for a win-win for all! We are negotiating better deals with better terms and margins and will continue to do so, like a Group Purchasing Organization or a GPO! We Are Problem Solvers! We solve many problems for our retail partners just by being in the store weekly. Solving these problems creates a lot of value for GPOX, making us an indispensable partner. The problems solved include but are not limited to:  ·Inventory Optimization: Store owners and managers no longer have to place orders for these products, as we replenish them with our weekly service. We manage weeks of supply.    ·Saves Retail Space: Retailers no longer have to take up valuable retail space to store additional products; they have precisely what they need for that week or delivery period.   5Table of Contents   ·Saves Labor Costs: Store owners and managers no longer have to break down pallets, enter the products into inventory, and restock shelves.    ·Planogram Integrity: At the corporate level, the category managers can rest assured their planograms for each store layout are being adhered to, leading to more accurate reporting, forecasting, and sales.    ·Analytics: Using our technology, enhanced reporting provides insights into customer buying behaviors, leading to optimal product assortments and inventory levels.    ·Right products, in the right place at the right time.    · Offering category expansion opportunities    ·We provide market research for clients' growth initiatives.    ·Territory: GPOX provides DSD service throughout the Midwest, which is the most challenging territory for this level of service. In the past, the Midwest was primarily serviced only by broadline or super-regional distributors.    ·Relationships: Our dedicated driving team has the lowest turnover rate in the industry, which means our store relationships are unmatched. This creates the opportunity to bring additional business and receive accurate customer feedback in real time.    ·Speed: Without lightning-fast response time to market trends and regulation changes, our competitors can compete!    ·Trends: Our speed of market is an advantage for the retailer and our supplier partners.    ·In Stock: Thanks to our model's efficiencies, retailers experience few to no out-of-stock, benefiting both the retailer and supplier. We partner with or handle supply disruptions so our clients can focus on their growth initiatives.    ·Retailer Private Label Products: The private label sector faces challenges related to customer perception of quality and competing with national brands. Analyzing sales data helps us support category managers in refining their product assortment, and DSD service protects the assortment from the common practice of national brands encroaching on shelf space. These practices contribute to a robust private label program for retailers, increasing our relationship's value.  We solve unique needs, like helping with new store set-ups & launches, which go beyond typical distribution relationships. GPOX Product Portfolio Strategy As we continue to grow, we are dedicated to expanding our product portfolio to meet the evolving needs of gas stations and convenience stores. We aim to represent diverse top-selling products that drive sales and enhance customer satisfaction. To achieve our growth objectives, we conduct thorough market research to identify emerging trends and consumer preferences specific to gas stations and convenience stores. This enables us to select top-selling products that align with current demand. The establishment of strong partnerships with best-in-class vendors and manufacturers known for their commitment to quality, innovation, and reliability is crucial. We rigorously evaluate potential products for inclusion in our portfolio to ensure they meet our standards for quality and compliance. PRISM+ Overview PRISM+ (Predictive Route, Inventory, and Service Management) is our in-house technology platform is designed specifically for the gas station and convenience store industry. As a DSD (Direct Store Delivery) distributor, PRISM+ enables us to optimize and streamline our operations, driving significant efficiencies and enhancing service quality.  6Table of Contents  How We Generate Sales We have worked hard to simplify our business model. The way we generate revenue is easy to understand. Current Revenue Streams We currently make money from the products we deliver to stores as follows:  1.Wholesale Markup + Volume Discounts: We purchase products from manufacturers at wholesale or discounted prices and sell them to retailers at a higher price. By selling large volumes, we benefit from economies of scale, which reduces our per-unit costs and increases our profit margins. The primary source of our revenue is the difference between our wholesale cost and the price at which we sell to retailers (the markup or margin).    2.Manufacturing: In some cases, we manufacture our own products. When GPOX is the manufacturer, we achieve significantly higher margins than wholesale products. Our profit margins are the difference between our manufacturing costs and the price we sell to retailers. This is superior to the profit from a markup on a product purchased from an outside manufacturer.    3.Delivery/Distribution Fees: We charge retailers a delivery fee for our weekly Direct Store Delivery (DSD) service. Sometimes, we purchase products on their behalf and store them in our Regional and Mini Hubs, and we earn a modest margin on these products when they are delivered.  Employees and Consultants We had 17 employees as of September 5, 2025, or as at the date of this Annual Report. As of the date of this Annual Report we are actively recruiting employees. We anticipate that we will require approximately 10 to 15 employees during fiscal 2026. We may also engage independent contractors as required to assist us in developing our business. ITEM 1A.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares have been listed for quotation on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “GPOX” since March 2021. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects. OTC securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Market issuers are traditionally smaller companies that are financially distressed, in bankruptcy, or do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. Holders As of September 08, 2025, we had 144 shareholders of record of our common stock with 84,798,256 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. Equity Compensation Plans On March 27, 2023, the board of directors and majority shareholder of the Company approved the adoption of the GPO Plus, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Equity Incentive Plan”). The purpose of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan is to foster and promote the Company’s long-term financial success and increase stockholder value by motivating performance through incentive compensation. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to encourage participants to acquire and maintain ownership interests in the Company and to attract and retain the services of talented individuals upon whose judgment and special efforts the successful conduct of the Company’s business is largely dependent. A total of 2,200,000 shares of common stock are reserved and may be issued under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares and performance units to our employees, officers, directors, and consultants, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and other benefits.  9Table of Contents The following table provides information regarding our equity compensation plans as of April 30, 2025: Equity Compensation Plan Information           Number of     Number of   securities to  Weighted-  securities   be issued  average  remaining   upon exercise  exercise price  available   of outstanding  of outstanding  for future issuance   options,  options,  under equity   warrants and  warrants and  compensation Plan category rights  rights  plans Equity compensation plans approved by security holders        1,867,122 common                -   N/A  shares  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 2,661,500 shares of common stock as loan inducements for promissory notes. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 3,716,317 shares of common stock for term extension of promissory notes. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 183,000 shares of common stock for interest and fees on a promissory note upon issuance of the notes. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock for office lease. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 240,000 shares of common stock for the repayment of of promissory notes.  During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock for the conversion of convertible notes of $10,000. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 2,377,500 shares of common stock to senior management and executives at $297,773 for services. During the three months ended April 30, 2025, the Company issued 7,960,915 shares of common stock to non-affiliated consultants at $1,034,765 for services. From May 1, 2025 through September 8, 2025, the Company issued 538,500 shares of common stock as loan inducements for promissory notes, including 76,000 shares accrued as stock payable as of April 30, 2025. From May 1, 2025 through September 8, 2025, the Company issued 1,859,429 shares of common stock for term extension of promissory notes, including 1,859,429 shares accrued as stock payable as of April 30, 2025. From May 1, 2025 through September 8, 2025, the Company issued 2,827,959 shares of common stock for the conversion of convertible notes of $282,796. From May 1, 2025 through September 8, 2025, the Company issued 2,385,000 shares of common stock to non-affiliated consultants at $314,713 for services, including 2,000,000 shares accrued as stock payable as of April 30, 2025., From May 1, 2025 through September 8, 2025, the Company issued 600,000 shares of common stock for repayment of promissory notes.  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There were no repurchases of common stock for the year ended April 30, 2025, or subsequently through the date of this report.  10Table of Contents  ITEM 6.

These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses. Specifically, based on nominal operations we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows:   Estimated Description Expenses ($) Public Company + Professional Fees $200,000 General & Administrative Expense $1,800,000 Marketing Expenses $600,000 Initial Personnel $100,000 GPO Distro $500,000 GPO Supplies - Inventory $150,000 Unallocated Working Capital/Contingency $100,000 Total Expenses $3,450,000   13Table of Contents We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately $3,450,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our planned expenses. In addition, our planned expenses, including legal, accounting and audit fees, and general and administrative expenses, may be higher in the event we enter into any significant transactions. These planned cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Although our cash requirements may be offset in part by anticipated revenues, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations, execute our business plan, and repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources. Contractual Obligations Not required for smaller reporting companies Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Revenue Recognition During the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company generated its first revenue since its establishment. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure:  ·The invoice has been generated and provided to the customer. ·The performance obligations for delivery of products are stated in the invoice. ·The transaction price has been identified in the invoice. ·The Company has allocated the transaction price to performance obligation in the invoice. ·The Company has shipped out the product and, therefore, satisfied the performance obligation.   14Table of Contents Convertible Financial Instruments The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP. When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all such compensation to employees and non-employees to be calculated based on its fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date and recognized in the earnings over the requisite service or vesting period. ITEM 7A.

(the “Company”) as of April 30, 2025, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. BASIS FOR OPINION These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ Bush & Associates CPA LLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024. Henderson, NevadaSeptember 10, 2025PCAOB ID Number 6797  F-2Table of Contents     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholdersof GPO Plus, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of GPO Plus, Inc.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION GPO Plus, Inc. (the “Company”) is a corporation originally established under the name of Koldeck, Inc. under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. On April 2, 2018, the Company changed our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. and merged with our wholly owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd. On June 19, 2020, the Company changed our corporate name from Global House Holdings Ltd. to GPO Plus, Inc. and merged with our wholly owned subsidiary GPO Plus, Inc. Global House Holdings Ltd. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name GPO Plus, Inc Effective May 5, 2020, Brett H. Pojunis acquired 5,000,000 (post-split) of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from Jian Han Chen. As a result of the transaction, Mr. Pojunis had voting and dispositive control over 53.67% of our outstanding voting securities. Mr. Pojunis’s ownership has since been diluted to 13.14%, and Mr. Chen no longer holds any equity interest in the Company. GPOX is pioneering the future of distribution to convenience stores and gas stations with our groundbreaking DSD distribution model. Our technology-driven distribution network is strategically designed to optimize effectiveness and maximize reach through a network of Regional Hubs and Mini Hubs. This innovative structure enhances our efficiency and service quality, setting a new benchmark for excellence in the distribution industry. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN The Company’s financial statements as of April 30, 2025, have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative deficit of $43,775,366. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) and are presented in US dollars. The Company’s year-end is April 30. Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of April 30, 2025, and April 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $336,249 and $69,415, respectively. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivables are recorded in accordance with ASC 310, “Receivables,” at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company does not currently have any amount recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on the management’s estimate and based on all accounts being current, the Company has not deemed it necessary to reserve for doubtful accounts at this time. As of April 30, 2025, and April 30, 2024, the Company had accounts receivable of $55,012 and $57,792, respectively. As of April 30, 2025, the Company has one customers concentrated over 10% of the accounts receivable at 36%, respectively. As of April 30, 2024, the Company has two customers concentrated over 10% of the accounts receivable at 90% and 10%, respectively. Prepaid Expense Prepaid expenses relate to security deposit for an office premise and prepayment made for future services in advance that will be expensed over time as the benefit of the services is received in the future expected within one year.   April 30,  April 30,   2025  2024 Security Deposit for office premise $3,500  $2,000 Prepayment for services to consultants  165   33,140 Total $3,665  $35,140   F-8Table of Contents Inventory Inventory is stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. As of April 30, 2025, and April 30, 2024, the Company recorded inventory reserve of $6,270 and $31,387 for slow moving or obsolete inventory. As of April 30, 2025, and April 30, 2024, the Company had finished goods inventory, net of inventory reserve of $83,299 and $402,152, respectively.    April 30, 2025  April 30, 2024 Mr Vapor $-  $3,473 Nutriumph®  32,412   50,039 Distro  12,574   15,675 Loon  31,926   324,142 Vyve  5,796   8,823 Coast  591   -   $83,299  $402,152  Intangible Assets The Company accounts for intangible assets (including trademarks and formula) in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.” ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below it carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology, and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. (Note 4) Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The depreciation and amortization methods are designed to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in years, of the respective assets as follows: Furniture and Equipment3-5 yearsComputer Equipment2 yearsAutomobile5 years Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements of a major nature are capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in the income. The long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. During year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, no impairment losses have been identified. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers - The invoice has been generated and provided to the customer.Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract - The performance obligations of delivery of products are stated in the invoice.Step 3: Determine the transaction price - The transaction price has been identified in the invoice.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations - The Company has allocated the transaction price to performance obligation in the invoice.Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation - The Company has shipped out the product and, therefore, satisfied the performance obligation. The risk of loss passed to the customers at the point of shipment. During the year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company recognized $4,744,856 and $4,356,303 of revenues and incurred cost of revenue of $3,613,051 and $3,521,158 and generated gross profit of $1,131,805 and $835,145 during the year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. In regard to the sales that occurred during the year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, there are no unfulfilled obligations related to the merchandise and product sales. During the year ended April 30, 2025, the Company has one customer who contributed over 10% of total sales at 93%. During the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company has one customer contributed over 10% of total sales at 95%. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities refer to trade payable to non-affiliate vendors and payroll liabilities to employees. As of April 30, 2025, and April 30, 2024, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $1,511,492 and $1,557,548, comprised of trade payable of $1,457,727 and $1,491,332 and payroll liabilities of $53,765 and $66,216, respectively.  F-9Table of Contents Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and whether the lease obligation is an operating lease or finance lease in accordance with ASC 842, “Leases.” A lease obligation is classified as a finance lease, if at least one of the following criteria is met:  ·A transferal of ownership of an asset to the lessee at the end of the term of the initial lease ·The lessee is certain that they will exercise a purchase option at the end of the term of the lease ·The leased asset has no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease ·The lease term is a major part of the economic life (75%) of the underlying asset ·The present value of lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset (90%) Operating leases Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, operating lease liabilities - current, and operating lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term by adding interest expense determined using the effective interest method to the amortization of right-of-use asset. Amortization of the right-of-use asset is calculated as the difference between the straight-line expense and the interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term. Lease expense is presented as a single line item in the operating expense in the statement of operations. The right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 360. Finance lease Finance leases are included in finance lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, finance lease liabilities - current, and finance lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The finance lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Interest expense is determined using the effective interest method. Amortization is recorded on the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis. Interest and amortization expense are generally presented separately in the statement of operations. The right-of-use asset is tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 360. Segments Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operates and manages its business as one operating segment and all of the Company’s revenues and operations are currently in the United States. Fair Value Measurement The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, , accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of short- and long-term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 –quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 –quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 –inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modelling inputs based on assumptions) None of the financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Related Party Balances and Transactions The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. (Note 7)  F-10Table of Contents Convertible Financial Instruments The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable US GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable US GAAP. When the Company has historically determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts have been recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. On May 1, 2021, the Company chose to early adopt ASU 2020-06 and did not record a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) discount on the issuance of convertible notes with the conversion rate below the Company’s market stock price on the date of note issuance. Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all such compensation to employees and non-employees to be calculated based on its fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date and recognized in the earnings over the requisite service or vesting period. During the year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, the Company recorded $1,591,571 stock-based compensation expense and $1,738,442 stock-based compensation expense, which includes amortization of stock issued for prepaid services of $0 and $27,000, respectively. The stock-based compensation incurred from common stock awarded to consultants and executives was reported under professional fees and professional fees - related parties in the statements of operation.   Year Ended   April 30,   2025  2024 Common stock award to consultants $1,304,643  $953,469 Common stock award to management and executives - related parties  286,928   784,973   $1,591,571  $1,738,442  Basic and Diluted Loss per Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. For the year ended April 30, 2025, and 2024, Series A preferred stock, convertible notes, warrants and common stock payable were potentially dilutive instruments and were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.    April 30,  April 30,   2025  2024   (Shares)  (Shares) Series A Preferred Shares  1,000,000   1,000,000 Convertible Notes  28,000   38,000 Warrants  168,000   168,000 Common Stock Payable  4,776,756   1,691,213    5,972,756   2,897,213   F-11Table of Contents The Company had 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding on April 30, 2025, and 2024, that are convertible into shares of common stock at a one-for-one rate.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, April 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  16Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of April 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending April 30, 2024: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm because as a smaller reporting company we are not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls Our management, which consists of our sole officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements, due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Except as provided above, there is no information to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Form 10-K that has not been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 9C.

We only have one officer and director and do not believe we need a code of ethics at this time. Committees of the Board Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating, compensation, or audit committee charter. Our directors believe that it is not necessary to have such committees at this time, because the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the board of directors. Our company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board of directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The board of directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our CEO at the address appearing on the first page of this annual report. Board and Committee Meetings Our board of directors held no formal meetings during the year ended April 30, 2024. All proceedings of the board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held. Audit Committee Financial Expert Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We do not currently have a director who is qualified to act as the head of the audit committee. ITEM 11.

Mr. Pojunis who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Secretary, is “independent” within the definition of independence provided in the Marketplace Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers and the independence requirements contemplated by Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. From inception to present date, we believe that the members of our audit committee and the board of directors have been and are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our consolidated financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES On October 3, 2023, the Company was informed that Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah a dba of Heaton & Company, PLLC (“Pinnacle”) had sold a portion of its business to GreenGrowth CPAs (“GreenGrowth”). On November 10, 2023, the Company engaged and executed an agreement with GreenGrowth, as the Company’s new independent accountant to replace Pinnacle. The reports of Pinnacle regarding the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, being the two most recent fiscal years for which the Company has filed audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except to indicate that there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The board of directors of the Company, acting as the audit committee, approved the decision to change independent accountants. During the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023, and 2022, and through October 31, 2023, the Company had no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with Pinnacle on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Pinnacle would have caused Pinnacle to make reference thereto in connection with its report. During the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, and through October 31, 2023, the Company did not experience any reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except that management of the Company discussed with Pinnacle the continued existence of material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Effective as of October 21, 2024, Green Growth CPAs (“Green Growth”) were dismissed as the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to audit the financial statements of GPO Plus, Inc. (the “Company”). Also, on such date, the Company’s Board of Directors engaged Bush & Associates CPA, LLC (“Bush”), to serve as its independent registered public accounting firm to review its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, and for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025. The reports of Green Growth on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that such reports included an explanatory paragraph with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. During the years ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, and the subsequent interim periods through the date of this report, there were no (a) disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with Green Growth on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Green Growth’s satisfaction, would have caused Green Growth to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its reports for such years; or (b) reportable events, as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. During the years ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, and through the date of this report, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has previously consulted with Bush regarding either (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and neither a written report was provided nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Bush concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (b) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v)) of Regulation S-K).  The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended April 30, 2025 and for fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows: GreenGrowth CPAs               Year Ended  Year Ended   April 30,  April 30, Fee Category 2025  2024        Audit Fees $21,999  $16.168 Audit-Related Fees  -   - Tax Fees  -   -          All Other Fees  -   - Total Fees $21,999  $16,168   26Table of Contents Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah   Year Ended  Year Ended   April 30,  April 30, Fee Category 2025  2024        Audit Fees $500  $28,614 Audit-Related Fees  -   - Tax Fees  -   -          All Other Fees  -   - Total Fees $500  $28,614  Bush and Associates CPA, LLC   Year EndedApril 30,2025  Year EndedApril 30,2024 Audit Fees $5,000  $ Audit-Related Fees  -   - Tax Fees  -   -          All Other Fees  -   - Total Fees $5,000  $  Audit committee policies & procedures. We do not currently have a standing audit committee. The above services were approved by our Board of Directors. Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors’ independence.  27Table of Contents  PART IV ITEM 15.
