Carver Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”)
filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (“Form 10-K”) with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 24, 2025. The Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 to
the Form 10-K, or “Form 10-K/A,” solely to revise Part III of the report to include the information previously
omitted from the Form 10-K. This Amendment No. 1 to the report continues to speak as of the date of filing of the report, and
except as expressly set forth herein we have not updated the disclosures contained in this Amendment No. 1 to the report to reflect
any events that occurred at a date subsequent to the filing of the report.
Pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), this Amendment No. 1 also contains new certifications of the
Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. Because no financial statements are included in this Amendment No. 1 and this Amendment No. 1 does not contain or amend
any disclosure with respect to Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, paragraphs 3, 4
and 5 of the Section 302 certifications have been omitted. In addition, because no financial statements are included in this Amendment
No. 1, new certifications of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to Section 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are not required to be included with this Amendment No. 1.
Except as described above or as expressly noted in this Amendment
No. 1, no other changes have been made to the Form 10-K.

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports
Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act requires Carver’s directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered
class of Carver’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market.
Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish Carver with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file.
Based solely on a review
of copies of such reports of ownership furnished to Carver, or written representations that no forms were necessary, Carver believes
that during the last fiscal year, all filing requirements applicable to its directors, officers and greater than ten percent stockholders
of Carver were complied with except as follows: a required Form 3 for Donald Felix and Marc
S. Winkler and a required Form 4 for Donald Felix were not filed on a timely basis.

Carver has adopted a Code
of Ethics, which applies to Carver’s directors and employees and sets forth important Company policies and procedures in conducting
Carver’s business in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. The Code of Ethics, including future amendments, is available free

by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Carver Bancorp, Inc., 75 West 125th Street, New York, New York 10027, or by telephoning
(718) 230-2900. Carver intends to post on its website any waiver under the codes granted to any of its directors or executive officers.
Clawback Policy

Clawback Policy (“Clawback Policy”). Under the Clawback Policy, if the Company is required to restate its financial results

Company’s current and former executive officers, provided that such individuals served as executive officers at any time during
the applicable performance period. A copy of our Clawback Policy was included by reference as Exhibit 97.1 to our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2025.

Finance and Audit Committee.
The Finance and Audit Committee
consists of Directors Colvin W. Grannum (Chairperson), Pazel G. Jackson, Jr., and Kenneth J. Knuckles. All members have been determined
to be independent directors. The Finance and Audit Committee’s primary duties and responsibilities are to:
·monitor
the integrity of Carver’s financial reporting process and systems of internal controls
regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance;
·manage
the independence and performance of Carver’s independent public auditors and internal
auditing function;
·monitor
the process for adhering to laws, regulations and Carver’s Code of Ethics; and
·provide
an avenue of communication among the independent auditors, management, the internal auditing
function and the Board of Directors.
Other specific duties and
responsibilities include reviewing Carver’s disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, Carver’s periodic filings
with the SEC and earnings releases; producing the required audit committee annual report for inclusion in Carver’s proxy statement;
and overseeing complaints concerning financial matters. The Finance and Audit Committee met eleven (11) times during fiscal year 2025,
including meetings to review Carver’s annual and quarterly financial results prior to their public issuance.
Report of the Finance and Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors
This report is furnished
by the Carver Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors as required by the rules of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
The report of the Finance and Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating
by reference this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K into any filing
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that Carver
specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed to be filed under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act.
The Board of Directors has
adopted a written charter that sets forth the Finance and Audit Committee’s duties and responsibilities and reflects applicable
rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC regulations.
All members of the Finance
and Audit Committee have been determined to be independent as defined in the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board
of Directors has determined that Pazel G. Jackson, Jr., Kenneth J. Knuckles, and Colvin W. Grannum each qualify as an “audit
committee financial expert.” The Finance and Audit Committee received the required written disclosures and letter from BDO USA,
LLP, Carver’s independent accountants for fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, required by applicable requirements of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit
Committee concerning the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence. The Finance and Audit Committee reviewed
and discussed with Carver’s management and BDO USA, LLP the audited financial statements of Carver contained in Carver’s

BDO USA, LLP the matters required to be discussed pursuant to the Codified Statements on Auditing Standards No. 1301, as amended
or supplemented.

Throughout the year, the
Finance and Audit Committee had full access to management and the independent and internal auditors for Carver. The Finance and Audit
Committee acts only in an oversight capacity and necessarily relies on the assurances and work of Carver’s management and independent
auditors who expressed an opinion on Carver’s annual financial statements.  Carver's management has the primary responsibility
for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal control.
As part of its ongoing activities,
the Finance and Audit Committee has:
·reviewed and discussed with management,
and our independent registered public accounting firm, the audited consolidated financial
statements of Carver for the year ended March 31, 2025;
·discussed with our independent registered
public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301
Communications with Audit Committees, as amended, and as adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board; and

disclosures and the letter from our independent registered public accounting firm mandated
by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the
independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Finance and
Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with our independent registered
public accounting firm its independence from Carver.

Benefit Plans
401(k) Savings Plan. Carver
maintains a 401(k) Savings Plan (“401(k) Plan”) with a profit-sharing feature for all eligible employees
of Carver. Carver matched contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 100% of pre-tax contributions made by each employee up to a
maximum of 4% of their pay, subject to IRS limitations. Carver suspended the matching contributions from November 2020 through December 2021.
In January 2021, Carver reinstated the matching contributions with an increase to the match contributions to 4%. All such matching
contributions are fully vested and non-forfeitable at all times regardless of the years of service with the Bank. Carver employees will
be eligible to participate upon their hire date. To be eligible to enroll, the employee must be 21 years of age. Under the profit-sharing
feature of the plan, if the Bank achieves a minimum of 70% of its fiscal year performance goal, the Compensation Committee may authorize
a non-elective contribution to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of each eligible employee of up to 2% of the employee’s annual pay,
subject to IRS limitations. This non-elective contribution, if made, is awarded regardless of whether the employee makes voluntary contributions
to the 401(k) Plan. Non-elective Company contributions vest 20% each year for the first five years of employment and are fully vested
thereafter. To be eligible for the non-elective company contribution, the employee must be 21 years of age, have completed at least one
year of service and be employed on the last day of the plan year, currently December 31, or have terminated employment for death,
disability or retirement. Carver did not award a non-elective contribution for the 401(k) Plan year that ended December 31,
2022.
Employment Agreement
Felix Employment Agreement
In connection with Donald
Felix’s appointment as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Bank, the Bank entered into an employment agreement
(the “Felix Employment Agreement”) with him effective November 1, 2024 and the key terms of the Felix Employment Agreement
are as follows:
The term of the Felix
Employment Agreement is two years and the term may be extended by mutual consent.  The Felix Employment Agreement provides that
Mr. Felix will receive an annual base salary of $700,000 and the base salary may be increased as the Board deems appropriate.
In addition to base salary, the Felix Employment Agreement provides for, among other things, a $100,000 signing bonus, two performance
equity grants, each with a fair market value of $100,000, with the first equity grant to be made as of the Start Date or as soon as administratively
practicable after the Start Date and the second equity grant will be made on November 1, 2025, a minimum annual performance-based
cash bonus opportunity of $500,000, temporary corporate housing in an amount up to $5,000 per month, and other benefit plans and arrangements
applicable to executive employees.
The Bank may terminate
Mr. Felix’s employment for “cause” (as defined in the Felix Employment Agreement) at any time, in which event
he would have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after his termination of employment.
Certain events resulting
in Mr. Felix’s termination of employment entitle him to severance benefits.  In the event of Mr. Felix’s involuntary
termination of employment without “cause” or in the event of a voluntary termination for “good reason” (as defined
in the Felix Employment Agreement), Mr. Felix would become entitled to a severance payment in the form of a cash lump sum equal
to: (x) fifty percent (50%) of Mr. Felix’s base salary; and (y) if such termination occurs after the one year anniversary
of the Start Date, a cash lump sum payment equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of Mr. Felix’s base salary, and the average
annual total incentive bonus earned by Mr. Felix for the three most recently completed calendar years; and, in each case, (z) the
value of one-year’s health care costs provided Mr. Felix elects continued insurance coverage under COBRA and full vesting
of equity awards.
9
In the event of Mr. Felix’s
involuntary termination of employment for a reason other than for cause or upon his voluntary termination for good reason within six
months prior to or within twenty-four months following a “change in control” (as defined in the Felix Employment Agreement),
Mr. Felix would become entitled to a severance payment in the form of a cash lump sum equal to three times the sum of: (a) Mr. Felix’s
base salary; and (b) the average annual total incentive bonus earned by Mr. Felix for three most recently completed calendar
years prior to the change in control, or if greater, the annual total incentive bonus that would have been earned in the year of the
change of control at target bonus opportunity and full vesting of equity awards.  In addition, Mr. Felix would be entitled
to a cash lump sum payment equal to the value of health care costs for thirty-six months. In the event that payments to Mr. Felix
become subject to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, such payments would be reduced if such reduction would leave Mr. Felix officer
better off on an after-tax basis.
Upon termination of Mr. Felix’s
employment, he will be subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete or to solicit business or employees of the Bank and
the Company for a period of one year following his termination of employment.  The Felix Employment Agreement also includes provisions
protecting the Company’s and Bank’s confidential business information.
MacKay Employment Agreement
In connection with Craig
C. MacKay’s appointment as the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Bank, the Bank entered into an
employment agreement (the “MacKay Employment Agreement”) with him effective October 1, 2023 and the key terms of the
Employment Agreement are as follows:
Term. The
term of the MacKay Employment Agreement commenced on October 1, 2023 (the “Term”) and the Term will end upon the earlier
of: (i) the date the Board of Directors appoints a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Bank, (ii) Mr. MacKay
provides written notice to the Bank that the Term will expire at the end of the month in which the notice of expiration is delivered
to the Bank, or (iii) April 1, 2024 provided that the Bank delivers a notice of expiration to Mr. MacKay no later than
March 1, 2024.  On October 31, 2024, Mr. MacKay resigned as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company and the Bank.
Cash Compensation.
Mr. MacKay’s annual base salary was $450,000, and Mr. MacKay may receive a bonus at the discretion of the Board of Directors
or the Compensation Committee.
Equity Grant.
No later than five days after the last day of the Term (the “Grant Date”), Mr. MacKay will receive a grant of Company
stock equal to the product of (i) 42,553 and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of months (including
partial months) in the Term and the denominator of which is 12.  The award will be one-hundred percent (100%) vested as of the Grant
Date.
Benefits. Mr. MacKay
will be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans, arrangements and perquisites offered to senior management of the Bank,
on terms and conditions no less favorable than the plans, arrangements and perquisites available to other members of senior management
of the Bank.
Termination without
Cause or for Good Reason following a Change in Control.  In the event of a change in control of the Bank or the Company, followed
by Mr. MacKay’s termination of employment without “cause” or with “good reason,” Mr. MacKay
would be entitled to a severance payment in the form of a cash lump sum equal to three times the sum of: (i) Mr. MacKay’s
base salary at the date of termination (or Mr. MacKay’s base salary in effect during any of the  prior three years, if
higher); and (ii) the average annual total incentive bonus earned by Mr. MacKay for three most recently completed calendar
years prior to the change control, or if greater, the annual total incentive bonus that would have been earned in the year of the change
of control at target bonus opportunity.  In addition, Mr. MacKay would be entitled to a cash lump sum payment equal to the
value of health care costs for thirty-six  months.  The definitions of “cause” and “good reason”
are set forth in the Employment Agreement.  In the event that payments to Mr. MacKay become subject to Sections 280G and
4999 of the Code, such payments would be reduced if such reduction would leave him better off on an after-tax basis.
10
Restrictive Covenants.
The MacKay Employment Agreement also provides non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of employment and for
generally one year thereafter, and confidentiality during the term of employment and surviving the end of the term of employment.

ITEM 13.CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND
RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.
Transactions with Certain Related Persons
Applicable law requires that
all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the general public and must not involve more than
the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Carver Federal offers loans to its directors, officers and employees,
which loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are not made with more favorable terms nor do they involve more than the
normal risk of collectability or present unfavorable features. Furthermore, loans above the greater of $25,000, or 5% of Carver Federal’s
capital and surplus (up to $500,000), to Carver Federal’s directors and executive officers must be approved in advance by a majority
of the disinterested members of Carver Federal’s Board of Directors. As of the date of this document, neither Carver nor Carver
Federal had any outstanding loans or extensions of credit to any of its executive officers or directors.
Director Independence
The Board of Directors has determined that each
of non-management directors is independent according to the Board’s independence standards as set out in its Bylaws, Corporate
Governance Principles, applicable rules of the SEC and the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. They are Robin L. Nunn, Lewis
P. Jones III, Colvin W. Grannum, Kenneth J. Knuckles, Pazel G. Jackson, Jr. and Jillian E. Joseph. Mr. MacKay will not be considered
an independent director during his tenure as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.

ITEM 14.PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.
General
Carver’s independent registered public accounting
firm for the year ended March 31, 2025 was BDO USA, LLP, New York, New York, PCAOB ID: 243.
Audit Fees
BDO USA, LLP’s billed audit fees for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were $398,000 and $372,000, respectively.
Audit-Related Fees
Carver’s audit-related fees during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were $92,580 and $88,140, respectively.
Tax Fees
Carver’s incurred tax fees during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were $38,850 and $35,665, respectively.
All Other Fees
Carver did not engage its current principal accountant
to render services during the last two fiscal years, other than as reported above.
Pre-Approval Policy for Services by Independent
Auditors
During fiscal year 2025,
the Finance and Audit Committee of Carver’s Board of Directors pre-approved the engagement of BDO USA, LLP to provide non-audit
services and considered whether, and determined that, the provision of such other services by BDO USA, LLP is compatible with maintaining
BDO USA, LLP’s independence.
The Finance and Audit Committee
has a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company’s independent auditor consistent
with applicable SEC rules. Under the policy, prior to the engagement of the independent auditors for the next year’s audit, management
submits an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of the four categories of services described above
to the Finance and Audit Committee for approval. Prior to engagement, the Finance and Audit Committee pre-approves these services by
category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Finance and Audit Committee will receive periodic reports from management on actual
fees versus the budget by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent
auditors for additional services not contemplated in the pre-approval. In those instances, the Finance and Audit Committee requires specific
pre-approval before engaging the independent auditor.
The Finance and Audit Committee
has delegated pre-approval authority, subject to certain limits, to the chairman of the Finance and Audit Committee. The chairman is
required to report, for informational purposes, any pre-approval decisions to the Finance and Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.
