Beauty brands are differentiated by numerous factors, including quality, performance, a particular lifestyle, where they are distributed (e.g., prestige or mass) and price point. Below is a chart showing brands we sell and how we view them based on lifestyle and price point: 4Table of Contents Estée Lauder brand products, which have been sold since 1946, have a reputation for innovation, sophistication and superior quality.

As the current owner and steward of the brand, we are continuing with the beauty products and have licensed the fashion brand and operations and eyewear to third parties. Consistent with the fashion brand, our products exude seductive modern-day glamour and include luxury fragrance, color cosmetics, men’s grooming products and skin care products for discerning consumers globally. Acquired in 2010, Smashbox Cosmetics is a Los Angeles-based, photo studio-inspired makeup brand with high performance products created for our consumers' everyday life in the spotlight.6Table of Contents Launched in 2012, AERIN is a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder. Acquired in 2014, Le Labo is a sensory and experiential lifestyle brand, deeply rooted in the craft of slow perfumery.

Social Impact and SustainabilityWe continue to integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Our social impact and sustainability initiatives help drive innovation, growth and efficiency across the business and within our brand portfolio. These initiatives also aim to foster employee engagement and build consumer trust and loyalty.Areas of focus include climate and energy; packaging; sourcing; green chemistry and ingredient transparency; inclusion; employee health and safety; and social investments. We have set goals or made commitments within these focus areas. For example, our goals related to climate and energy support efficiency and conservation within our facilities, internal supply chain and value chain. Certain goals are also intended to help us reduce cost and waste. The Nominating and ESG Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for our Company’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities and practices, including citizenship and sustainability matters. Our social impact and sustainability efforts are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of senior management, along with employees across the organization, help to drive our strategic initiatives concerning social impact and sustainability.Additional information related to our social impact and sustainability matters can be found at www.elcompanies.com.DistributionWe operate as a wholesaler, with our products sold in brick-and-mortar locations and on various e-commerce platforms, including those operated by department stores, duty-free retailers, specialty-multi retailers, online pure players, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies, and top-tier salons and spas. Additionally, we operate a direct-to-consumer business across freestanding stores, our brands' websites and third-party online platforms. Our general practice is to accept returns of our products from customers if properly requested and approved.Our online sites, including our brand.com sites as well as those operated by authorized retailers and through third-party online platforms are in approximately 50 countries, with a majority of these online sales generated in mainland China, the United States and the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2025, we closed freestanding stores in underperforming areas of our business and opened new freestanding stores where growth opportunities existed. We operated approximately 1,600 freestanding stores as of June 30, 2025. Most freestanding stores are operated by us under a single brand name, such as M·A·C, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Over 300 of the freestanding stores are multi-branded company stores, primarily in outlet malls. We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts. We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors who we believe share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands. For information regarding our net sales by geographic region, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 – Revenue Recognition.8Table of ContentsAs we have done historically, we continue to develop our strategy, assess performance and allocate resources by product category and will continue to report results by product category. To enhance accountability and streamline operations within the organization, as well as to align with our recently announced leadership changes, we have reorganized our geographic regions. Beginning with the fiscal 2026 first quarter, we will be reporting our fiscal 2026 and comparative fiscal 2025 results by geographic region under the new regional structure. Our four new geographic regions are: •The Americas, which will continue to include North America and Latin America; •Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland and Emerging Markets ("EUKEM"), which will continue to include the geographic markets of our previously reported Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, will exclude our global travel retail business, and will include our Southeast Asian Emerging Markets, previously reported in our Asia/Pacific region, of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam; •Asia/Pacific, which will continue to include certain geographic markets of our previously reported Asia/Pacific region, such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong SAR, and Australia, among others, and will also include our global travel retail business, previously reported in our Europe, the Middle East & Africa region; and •Mainland China, previously reported in our Asia/Pacific region, will now be reported as a separate region. Our “Emerging Markets” in The Americas are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Peru and in our reorganized region of EUKEM are Central Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Middle East, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. Our “Priority Emerging Markets” in The Americas are Brazil and Mexico and in EUKEM are India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Middle East, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.Our references to North America within this document include the United States and Canada.CustomersOur strategy is to build strong relationships globally with select retailers, and our senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis in support of these relationships. We believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. In addition, we connect with our consumers directly through freestanding stores, e-commerce sites and social media to build a robust omnichannel experience that allows consumers to shop in these and other channels.  MarketingOur strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of distinctive brands across four major product categories. Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels, key travel corridors and geographies and we continue to expand our consumer coverage by entering high-growth, consumer-preferred channels, markets, media and price tiers where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us. By putting the consumer at the center of every engagement and leveraging our geographic and distribution channel diversity, we offer strong consumer coverage which allows us to reach and engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with local relevance, inclusiveness and appeal. This strategy is built around “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.” Our founder, Mrs. Estée Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “High-Touch” service and high-quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base. Our “High-Touch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience. As our business has grown and channel mix has evolved, we have further expanded our marketing philosophy and “High-Touch” execution to build both online and offline personalized consumer experiences through digital and physical demonstration, targeted digital media and tailored trial-to-loyalty pathways. We plan to continue to leverage our core strengths, including the quality of our products, our “High-Touch” consumer engagement and a diversified portfolio of brands, channels and geographies. 9Table of ContentsOur marketing strategies vary by brand, local market and distribution channel. We have a diverse portfolio of brands, and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus, understanding of the core consumer and local relevance. This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, create trial, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Hero products are at the core of our brand marketing strategies. They are the pillars of our brands and historically have provided strong results through high repeat sales and consumer loyalty. In addition to continuing to attract existing consumers, our hero products provide an opportunity for new consumers to be introduced to our desirable products, creating consumer traffic across all channels of distribution. We aim to further strengthen our hero products, and create new ones, through continuous review of our product portfolio and transformative innovation that delivers fast-to-market, trend-driven products across prestige price tiers focused on in-demand subcategories, benefits, and occasions. Our marketing planning approach focuses on effective and impactful visible advertising spending, optimizing marketing programs, and eliminating low-return activities to accelerate new consumer acquisition. To that end, we also leverage local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively. This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods, and also using these insights to develop new ways to innovate, engage consumers, build brand equity and sell products. For a number of products, we create and deploy 360° integrated consumer engagement programs. We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers’ websites including through digital and social media, broad reach advertising, such as billboards in cities and airports, television and email. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print, to drive influencer amplification.We continue to focus on increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology, by expanding our digital and omnichannel presence, including social media and influencer marketing. Our ongoing investments in new analytical capabilities enable us to create more personalized experiences across our distribution channels. We also anticipate and monitor emerging platforms, balancing speed to market with brand protection to ensure readiness while safeguarding brand equity. We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and “High-Touch” consumer engagement, in order to continue to offer better experiences and services and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online. We also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites. We are leveraging artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the marketing value chain to enhance personalization at scale, increase speed to market and reduce costs. As examples, we are using AI to identify insights to inform consumer-centric campaigns, develop and test concepts, and produce creative content. Promotional activities, in-store displays, and online navigation are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase. Sampling is a key promotional activity as the quality and perceived benefits of sample products are very effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers. Such activities attract consumers and keep existing consumers engaged. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.As consumer behaviors, digital-first consumer journeys and e-commerce evolve, we adjust our direct-to-consumer business models and consumer engagement programs. These models and programs are designed to provide distinct one-to-one and one-to-many “High-Touch” omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors, consultants, and makeup artists.Information TechnologyInformation technology, including operational technology and our websites, is a key enabler of all aspects of our business, from research and development, product development, production and distribution, to marketing, sales and order processing, consumer experiences as well as finance and human resources. We continue to make strategic investments to align with our long-term strategy and to maintain and enhance our information technology and cybersecurity infrastructure. We are focused on optimizing adoption of such investments to maximize return on investment and realized value. The modernization and simplification of our technology ecosystem remains a key focus, as we increasingly leverage the benefits of the cloud. 10Table of ContentsWe recognize technology presents opportunities for competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities and the use of emerging technologies, including investments in AI, across various aspects of our business. As an example, this includes the strategic utilization of data to provide better visibility into consumer trends, to increase responsiveness in our product development. Research and DevelopmentWe believe we are an industry leader in the development of new products, and strive to deliver breakthrough, on-trend and commercial innovation to consumers around the world. Our research and development group, which includes scientists, engineers, analysts, and other employees involved in product and packaging innovation, works closely with our marketing and product development teams, as well as external partners in certain cases, to generate new technologies, design new testing methods, identify new materials, develop new products and product-line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products. In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver environmentally responsible products that meet or exceed consumer expectations. The research and development group has research-based working relationships with several U.S. and international dermatology and medical institutions, research universities and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the research and development group are also responsible for product safety, registration and regulatory compliance matters. Our research and development costs totaled $316 million, $360 million and $344 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are expensed as incurred. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 1,100 employees engaged in research and development activities. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2. Properties.Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw MaterialsWe manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in The Americas (United States and Canada); in Europe, the Middle East & Africa (Belgium, Switzerland and the United Kingdom); and in Asia/Pacific (Japan), and we also leverage global third-party manufacturing networks. We continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment, ensure supply sufficiency, reduce costs and adjust our operations to respond to external challenges. Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated. While we believe our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements, we continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile. From time to time, demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a short-term basis, but we believe these changes will not impact our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives.We have established a flexible global distribution network that is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network, particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to shifts in channel and consumer preferences, external challenges, as well as identifying opportunities to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. We have established regional and local distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers.As discussed above, we continue to focus on social impact and sustainability across our operations. Focus areas include employee health and safety and minimizing our impact on the environment. This is achieved, in part, through investment in equipment while enhancing the work environment through safe practices and capabilities. We also engage in initiatives to improve our equipment and buildings to support and deliver our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment. Environmental efforts include waste reduction, reducing industrial waste to landfills, investments in renewable energy sources and packaging that incorporates recyclable and recycled content.The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Management function. We also partner with an extensive network of third-party manufacturers that help us access innovation and capacity. We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market, ensuring supply sufficiency and reducing costs. In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies, lead-time reduction and reduced emissions. 11Table of ContentsSome of our products rely on single-source or a limited number of suppliers; however, we believe we have a robust business continuity strategy, sophisticated capacity planning tools and strategic inventory buffer and multi-sourcing solutions. In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and packaging components for virtually all materials used in the production of our products. From time to time, we may experience supply disruptions on a short-term basis, but we currently believe we have adequate resources of supply and our portfolio of suppliers has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain, and we augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing plants and networks based upon the changing needs of the business. Additionally, in connection with our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (“PRGP”), we have, and are continuing to focus on our levels of excess inventory and obsolescence and cost efficiencies within our global supply chain network. As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.CompetitionThere is significant competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold. Brand recognition, product quality and effectiveness, distribution channels, accessibility, and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. There continues to be interest and awareness from our customers and consumers in responsibly-sourced ingredients and environmentally sustainable products, and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these preferences due to our social impact and sustainability efforts. Marketing, merchandising, in-store and online experiences and demonstrations, and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions. We compete against a number of global and local companies. Some of our competitors are large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. Our competitors include L’Oreal S.A.; Unilever; Procter & Gamble; LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Chanel S.A.; Beiersdorf; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Coty Inc.; and Puig. We also face competition from a number of independent brands (“Indie Brands”), some of which are backed by private-equity investors, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.Trademarks, Patents and CopyrightsWe own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products in the United States, China and in the other principal markets where such products are sold, including Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, TOM FORD, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, KILIAN PARIS, Too Faced, Dr.Jart+, The Ordinary and NIOD. We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics, skin care and/or related products for AERIN, BALMAIN, and Dr. Andrew Weil. For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see Item 8.

We view human capital management and the strength of our employees as integral to the long-term success and resilience of our business. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight to management on a range of human capital matters, including inclusion, health and safety, and compensation and benefits. 12Table of ContentsAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had approximately 57,000 and 62,000 employees worldwide, respectively, including approximately 35,000 and 37,000 demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. At June 30, 2025, approximately 71% of our global employees were full-time, approximately 15% were temporary and approximately 14% were part-time employees, with approximately 25% of our global employees located in the United States and approximately 75% located outside of the United States. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 80% of our employees were female and 20% were male, and approximately 61% of our employees at the level of Vice President and above were female and 39% were male. We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by works council agreements or other syndicate arrangements.Our human capital management includes the following strategic areas:Building a Strong and Inclusive CultureWe remain committed to our values and supporting an inclusive environment for all of our employees that better enables us to create innovative products and services as we continually strive to meet the evolving needs of our global consumers. Our objective in creating a culture of belonging is to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best talent globally and promote an environment where employees are motivated to succeed. We continuously encourage a culture of fairness, equal access to opportunities, including positions of leadership, and ongoing learning and growth. We are proud of our history of driving awareness and acceptance around the world and for standing up for the rights of individuals in the workplace and beyond. Talent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development Hiring, retaining and developing the best talent globally is key to our success. Our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in career development, succession planning and building leadership at various levels across the organization, as well as measuring, recognizing and rewarding business and leadership performance. Our investments include providing programs to equip our employees with the right skillsets and knowledge, including through training and development programs that are focused on strengthening leadership and professional skills at various stages of an employee's career, as well as opportunities to gain experience through cross-organization short-term and long-term projects in partnership with other brands, functions or regions. We believe these programs and opportunities create a pipeline of talent and leadership, necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy in an ever-changing business environment.To enhance our culture and measure our human capital efforts, we regularly engage with our employees and provide several mechanisms for our employees to provide their feedback. Based on our review of employee survey results, action plans are implemented to enhance employee satisfaction and to drive alignment with our overall human capital strategy. One example is our Talent Marketplace (called ELC Grow), which enables employees to explore roles, projects, and networking opportunities which align to their skills and career aspirations; empowering employees to take deliberate actions toward their growth and development. Health and SafetyWe are committed to providing a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We establish and update safety policies and procedures, train employees on our safety guidelines and local requirements, and seek to create a culture focused on well-being and safety through ongoing communication, awareness and engagement. Employee RewardsWe offer competitive compensation and benefit packages to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent, and we are committed to fair pay across the organization. To support the health and well-being of our employees, our competitive benefit packages may include, depending upon position and location, pension and post-retirement benefit plans, health and wellness benefits, flexible working arrangements, parental (maternal and paternal) leave and support programs, adoption assistance and education-related benefits. 13Table of ContentsVolunteerism and Community Engagement We support volunteer efforts by our employees as our long-term success can benefit from the vitality of the communities where we have a presence. This is done through our ELC Good Works program, our global charitable and volunteerism program which allows eligible employees to create and participate in volunteer activities, with their cash donations matched by the Company and volunteer hours rewarded through additional cash donations by the Company.Government RegulationWe and our products are subject to regulation by numerous federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such laws and regulations relate to a wide range of matters including ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, transport and the sale, disposal and safety of our products, as well as environmental matters. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations.SeasonalityOur results of operations in total, by product category and geographic region, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year. The higher net sales that we typically recognize in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by consumers for special events and by retailers for holiday selling seasons. Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by product category and geographic region in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods. Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by holiday and key shopping moments, as well as variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.Availability of ReportsWe make available financial information, news releases and other information on our website: www.elcompanies.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports, as well as any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge via the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov or our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports and amendments with, or furnish them to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of ConductThe Board of Directors has developed corporate governance practices to help it fulfill its responsibilities to stockholders in providing general direction and oversight of management. These practices are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. We also have a Code of Conduct (“Code”) applicable to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior financial officers. These documents and any waiver of a provision of the Code granted to any senior officer or director or any material amendment to the Code may be found in the “Investors” section of our website: www.elcompanies.com under the heading “Corporate Governance.” The charters for the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and ESG Committee may be found in the same location on our website. 14Table of ContentsInformation about our Executive Officers*NameAgePosition(s) HeldMichael Bowes54Executive Vice President, Chief People OfficerRoberto Canevari59Executive Vice President, Chief Value Chain OfficerStéphane de La Faverie51President, Chief Executive Officer and a DirectorJane Hertzmark Hudis65Executive Vice President, Chief Brand OfficerRashida La Lande51Executive Vice President and General CounselRonald S.

ZinterhoferFounding Partner of Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P., a private equity firm*As of August 13, 202516Table of ContentsItem 1A.  Risk Factors.There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be not material. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, which includes (a) our prospects, (b) our financial condition, (c) our results of operations, (d) our reputation, and (e) the trading prices of our securities, may be adversely affected. Risks related to our Business and our IndustryThe beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our business will suffer.We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies. Some competitors have greater resources than we do, others are newer companies (such as Indie Brands, some of which are backed by private-equity investors), and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented. The beauty business can change rapidly due to consumer preferences and industry trends. In some cases, we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions as quickly as our competitors. Competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, and e-commerce initiatives, including the ability to effectively leverage existing and emerging digital technologies, such as AI and data analytics, to gain more commercial insights and develop relevant marketing concepts and advertising to reach consumers. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas.Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business. Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our business. Our reputation could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors, including, given the legal, regulatory and ethical landscape around the use of AI, our ability to adapt and use the emerging technology in an effective and ethical manner. If our reputation is adversely affected, our ability to attract and retain customers, consumers and employees could be impacted. In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands. Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world (e.g., China or the United States) could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our business.Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer preferences for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop. We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our selling, advertising, promotional and other consumer engagement activities to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. We recognize consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly, driven by the use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our business will suffer. In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands, channels and/or countries. If such a situation persists or one or more brands, channels or countries fails to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.17Table of ContentsIn certain key markets, such as the United States, we have seen a longer-term decline in retail traffic in our department store customers. Consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade, from these or other factors, may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers. A severe, adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities), enter bankruptcy (or similar proceedings) or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.Achieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, supply chain facilities, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets. These investments may result in short-term costs without any current sales and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings. In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs, inclusive of restructuring and other charges, in doing so. Although we believe our strategy will lead to long-term growth in sales and profitability, we may not realize the anticipated benefits. The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business.Acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic actions may expose us to additional risks.We continuously review acquisition and strategic opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. In addition, we periodically review our brand portfolio, and our strategy includes potential divestitures of certain brands as we rationalize product offerings. There can be no assurance we will be able to identify these strategic actions, be the successful bidder, and consummate such transactions on favorable terms, or otherwise realize the full intended benefit of such transactions. Acquisitions including strategic investments or other activities entail numerous risks, which may include: (i) difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers, consumers or suppliers of, acquired businesses; (ii) diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses; (iii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers and consumers of ours or the companies in which we invest; (iv) adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; (v) reputational risks associated with the activities of the businesses that we acquire or in which we invest; and (vi) risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.In addition, the assumptions we use to evaluate acquisition opportunities have in the past, and may in the future, prove to be inaccurate, and intended benefits may not be realized. If required, any financing for these transactions would result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both. The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business. If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.Completed acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred, as well as assess the recoverability of other intangible assets, and have recorded goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in each of the last few fiscal years. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.Our failure to achieve the long-term plan for acquired businesses, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition, divestiture and strategic activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.18Table of ContentsOur business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters.There continues to be a focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders concerning social impact and sustainability and other ESG matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives, including goals and commitments, regarding our focus areas, which include environmental and climate matters; packaging; sourcing; product formulation; social investments; and inclusion. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives, or in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which ESG efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals by stakeholders who support these initiatives or those that oppose them. In addition, we could be perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters, or related ESG matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use AI, and challenges with properly managing its use could have an adverse impact on our business.We are using AI solutions, including machine learning and generative AI tools, to assist in the development of our products, engage with consumers, and in the use of internal tools that support our business. These applications may become increasingly important in our operations over time. This emerging technology presents risks inherent in its use, including risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, hallucinations, bias or discrimination, and intellectual property infringement. In addition, the use of AI may increase cybersecurity and data privacy risks, such as intended, unintended, or inadvertent access to, transmission, or leakage of proprietary or sensitive information. These risks may become more pronounced as organizational reliance on AI increases. No assurance can be made that the usage of AI will assist us in being more efficient in all cases. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their business, services, and products more rapidly or more successfully than us, which could hinder our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business. The technologies underlying AI and their use cases are rapidly developing, and it is not possible to predict all the legal, reputational, operational or technological risks related to the use of AI. While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, uncertainty will remain, and our obligation to comply with the evolving regulatory landscape could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our business.A general economic downturn, or disruption in business conditions may adversely affect our business including consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers.The general level of consumer spending is affected by many factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence and sentiment generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers. We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer. In the event of a retailer liquidation, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity. Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, disruptions in local or global business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic or other health issues, geopolitical or local conflicts, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.Events that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.A downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence and sentiment, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability. We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism. Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment; social, political and human rights issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs or sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. For example, tariffs imposed on goods we import into the United States and/or tariffs on goods we import into other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, as could geopolitical tensions involving countries that are key markets for us, or where we manufacture our products or source ingredients.19Table of ContentsVolatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions. Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive. If any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.Our success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products. If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, counterfeit versions of some of our products may be sold by third parties, which may pose safety risks, may fail to meet consumers’ expectations, and may have a negative impact on our business.Our success depends, in part, on our key personnel.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team. We have had, and may continue to have, changes to senior management and the composition of our Board of Directors, and we are still in the process of implementing a change in our organizational design, including through Beauty Reimagined and our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (“PRGP”). Transition periods accompanying changes in leadership and changes due to business reorganization may result in uncertainty, impact business performance and strategies and retention of personnel. As we restructure our workforce from time to time, the risk of potential employment-related claims and disputes may also increase, resulting in potential reputational harm, costs, losses, and other liabilities. The unexpected loss of, or misconduct by, one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain personnel across all levels of our business. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. These risks may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives, as well as by market conditions.Competition for employees can be intense, and although many of our key personnel have signed non-compete agreements, it is possible that these agreements would be unenforceable, in whole or in part, in some jurisdictions, permitting employees in those jurisdictions to work for our competitors.We are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations. We operate on a global basis, with a substantial majority of our net sales and operating income generated outside the United States. We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world. Our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including: (i) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our business, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets; (ii) foreign or U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, immigration and travel, operations, and investments; currency exchange controls; restrictions on imports and exports, including license requirements; tariffs; sanctions; and taxes; (iii) lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; (iv) adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; (v) concentration of sales growth or profitability in one or more countries; and (vi) social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as a pandemic, terrorist attack, war or other military action. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.20Table of ContentsA disruption in our operations, including supply chain, could adversely affect our business.As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities. Such risks include industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, capacity constraints, disruptions in ingredient, material or packaging supply or availability of natural resources (e.g., water), as well as global shortages, disruptions in supply chain or information technology, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events or external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world. Some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations. As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.As part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to improve our essential business services, which includes finding ways to be more cost-effective and efficient. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that we believe can be performed more effectively by external service providers. The failure of one or more such providers to deliver the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices or service levels that we expect, the failure of one or more of such providers to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, compliance with laws, disruptions arising from the transition of functions to an outsourcing provider, or the costs incurred in returning these outsourced functions to being performed under our management and direct control, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, when we transition to, from or between external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks related to Legal and Regulatory MattersChanges in laws, regulations and policies could adversely affect our business.Our business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies around the world. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect our business could adversely affect our business. These changes include accounting standards, as well as laws and regulations relating to tax matters, trade (including sanctions), data privacy (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), cybersecurity, anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, customs matters, product registration, ingredients, chemicals, packaging, selective distribution, and environmental or climate change matters.Disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business.We are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters, including ones relating to product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims), advertising, regulatory, employment, intellectual property, real estate, environmental, trade relations, securities, tax and privacy. In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.21Table of ContentsGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could harm our business.As we operate in various locations around the world, our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards. Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business. Regardless of the outcomes, these reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business.Risks related to Technology and Cybersecurity MattersThe compromise or interruption of, or damage to, our information technology (including our operational technology and websites) by cybersecurity incidents, data security breaches, other security problems, design defects or system failures could have a material negative impact on our business.We rely on information technology that supports our business processes, including research and development, product development, production, distribution, marketing, sales, order processing, consumer experiences, human resource management, finance and internal and external communications throughout the world. We have e-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries. If our information technology does not function properly, or is not adequately supported or updated, it could adversely affect the Company’s business and operations. We experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees on our information technology and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may obtain in the future, access to our systems and data (including unauthorized acquisition of such data). Such incidents have also caused, and may in the future cause, disruption to parts of our business operations and result in various expenses for investigation, remediation and other related matters.Cybersecurity incidents at our Company have in the past resulted from, and may in the future result from, social engineering or impersonation of authorized users, and may also result from efforts to discover and exploit design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. In some instances, efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent incidents have in the past and may in the future reduce the functionality or performance of our information technology, which could negatively impact our business. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including the covert introduction of malware to our information technology, and the use of techniques or processes that change frequently, may be disguised or difficult to detect, or are designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, and may continue undetected for an extended period of time. In addition, some of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and customers have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such incidents, which could in turn disrupt our business. The evolution and adoption of emerging technologies, such as AI, may intensify cybersecurity risks as techniques used in cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve and develop. Insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses.As part of our normal business activities, we collect, maintain, transmit, store and otherwise process certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information of consumers, customers, suppliers, service providers and employees. We share some of this information with certain third parties who assist us with business matters. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive data, including personal information, over networks. Any unauthorized access or data acquisition, despite security measures in place to protect such data, or other failure on the part of us or third parties to maintain the security of such data could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, legal obligations, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also could result in deterioration in confidence in our Company and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a cybersecurity incident could require that we expend significant additional resources on remediation, restoration and enhancement of our information technology.22Table of ContentsRisks related to our Securities and our Ownership StructureThe trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance.Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business. This could include forecasts of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. We assume no responsibility to provide or update guidance, and any longer-term guidance we may provide is based on goals we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock; however, at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends and/or the repurchase of our Class A Common Stock. Going forward, at any time, we could stop, suspend or change the amounts of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.In all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our business, whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, or otherwise, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect. Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q). These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics, or business outcomes, will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.Outside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period. Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance. Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations. If our actual results differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.We are controlled by the Lauder family. As a result, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.As of August 13, 2025, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 84% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock. In addition, four members of the Lauder family are on our Board of Directors. One other member of the Lauder family is an executive officer.As a result of their stock ownership and positions at the Company, as well as our dual-class structure, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including all matters requiring stockholder approval (e.g., the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets) for the foreseeable future. In addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual-class stock structures, the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.23Table of ContentsWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies.”The Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (1) a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2) we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.While we have voluntarily caused our Board of Directors to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and ESG Committee and Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and ESG Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors. As a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements.Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.None.Item 1C.  Cybersecurity.Risk Management and StrategyOur enterprise risk management framework considers cybersecurity risk in conjunction with our other Company risks as part of the overall risk assessment process. Our enterprise risk management team collaborates with the cybersecurity function, led by the Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), to gather their insights and risk mitigation strategies for managing cybersecurity threats. This integrated approach helps us assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks along with our other operational, financial and strategic risks, assisting in more effectively managing interdependencies among risks and enhancing risk mitigation strategies. We have implemented a cybersecurity program including processes, technologies, and controls to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. This program includes implementing new technologies to proactively identify and monitor new vulnerabilities and reduce risk, conducting due diligence of third-party vendors’ information security programs, maintaining security policies and standards and regularly updating and testing our response planning and protocols. We maintain a formal information security training program for employees that includes training on matters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory training on data privacy. We also have a
third-party cybersecurity risk review process, including requiring key third-party service providers to complete initial and periodic security assessments, which prioritizes, monitors and assesses the risks associated with our third-party service provider interactions. To evaluate and enhance our cybersecurity program, we periodically utilize third-party experts to undertake maturity assessments of the program. We have also adopted a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to effectively identify, analyze, contain, remediate and eradicate, escalate, report, and appropriately document cybersecurity incidents. The plan also includes a materiality assessment framework that sets forth procedures and escalation protocols to support our assessment of whether a cybersecurity incident is material and subject to SEC reporting requirements. Such escalation protocols include the involvement of the CISO and other senior leaders across various functions, including finance, legal, privacy and global communications, as appropriate. We also maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cybersecurity incidents.24Table of ContentsWe have experienced cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees on our information technology; however, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operation or financial condition. However, we cannot eliminate all risks and the compromise or interruption of, or damage to, our information technology (including our operational technology and websites) by cybersecurity incidents could have a material negative impact on our business. For a more detailed discussion of the risks, see Risks related to Technology and Cybersecurity Matters within Item 1A. Risk Factors.GovernanceThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our information security program, which includes oversight of the cybersecurity program and management of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee receives at least semi-annual updates from the CISO, which typically address our cybersecurity strategy, initiatives, key security metrics, business response plans and the evolving cyber threat landscape and a detailed threat assessment relating to information technology risks.At the management level, our cybersecurity program is led by the CISO, who is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. The CISO is informed about cybersecurity threats and incidents in accordance with the cybersecurity incident response plan as discussed above. The CISO, who reports to the Chief Technology, Data and Analytics Officer, regularly provides updates to the Chair of the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer. We also have protocols by which certain cybersecurity incidents are reported promptly to the Chair of the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate. The Company’s CISO has served in various cybersecurity roles for over 20 years, leading a variety of cybersecurity and risk capabilities and also holds multiple cybersecurity certifications such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Information Systems Auditor, and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control.

The dividend is payable in cash on September 16, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 2, 2025. We expect to continue the payment of cash dividends in the future, but there can be no assurance as to the amounts of any dividends declared or that the Board of Directors will continue to declare them. As of August 13, 2025, there were 3,262 record holders of Class A Common Stock and 13 record holders of Class B Common Stock.Share Repurchase ProgramWe are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. The following table provides information relating to our repurchase of Class A Common Stock during the referenced periods:PeriodTotal Number of Shares Purchased(1)Average Price Paid Per ShareTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part ofPublicly Announced ProgramMaximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program(2)April 2025—$— —25,073,242May 20253,86564.84 —25,073,242June 2025—— —25,073,2423,86564.84 —(1)Represents shares that were repurchased by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the payout of certain stock-based compensation arrangements.(2)The Board of Directors has authorized the current repurchase program for up to 256.0 million shares. The total amount was last increased by the Board on October 31, 2018. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date.Beginning in December 2022, we suspended the repurchase of shares of our Class A Common Stock under our publicly announced program.

Operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in Europe, the Middle East & Africa is included in that region and in The Americas. This is primarily due to certain capabilities related to the travel retail business that are centralized in The Americas region and, as such, a component of the operating income generated by this business is transferred to The Americas through an intercompany royalty. 30Table of ContentsPeriod-over-period changes in our net sales are generally attributable to the impacts from (i) pricing on our base portfolio, including changes in mix and those due to strategic pricing actions, (ii) volume, including changes driven by the impact of new product innovation, (iii) acquisitions and/or divestitures, and/or (iv) foreign currency translation. The percentages disclosed for these impacts are calculated on an individual basis.The net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices, due to strategic pricing actions, and mix shifts within and among product categories, geographic regions, brands and distribution channels. The prices at which we sell our products vary by brand, distribution channel (e.g., wholesale or direct-to-consumer) and may also vary by country. Our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers. Prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products. New product innovation includes the introduction of new products, as well as changes related to existing products or markets where they are sold, including reformulations, regional expansion, repackaging and sets. A product is considered "new innovation" for the twelve-month period following the initial shipment date. Our innovation is often launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year. We continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. The impact of new product introductions, including timing compared to introductions in prior periods, also affects our results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results, provision for income taxes and diluted net (loss) earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior year monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. OverviewWe are a leader in prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with high quality products and services. Within prestige beauty, we are diversified by product category, geography, brand, product sub-category, channel, consumer segment and price point. We also leverage consumer analytics and insights across our brand portfolio to grow sales and pursue profitable opportunities. These analytics and insights, combined with our creativity, also inform our innovation to provide a broad, locally-relevant and inclusive range of prestige products with the aim of competing effectively for a greater share of a consumer's beauty routine. Our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are attractive. Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. We are continually evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement, recruitment and loyalty. We strive to strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets.31Table of ContentsWe approach distribution strategically by product category and location and seek to optimize distribution by matching our brands with appropriate opportunities while seeking to maintain high productivity per door. We are expanding our brands' locations as we continue to seek high-growth opportunities to reach new consumers in online, freestanding stores, specialty-multi and travel retail, which we believe will be higher growth channels in the long term. We also focus on brand-building retail activities, technology-driven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the shopping experience for consumers.OutlookWe have experienced challenges within our business and we expect volatility and uncertainty to continue. Although there are early signs of stabilization in mainland China, travel retail continues to be weak and challenges persist in the West, including subdued sentiment in the U.S. and Western Europe. These challenges are collectively expected to impact net sales and profitability, including impacts to our effective tax rate from changes to our geographical mix of earnings. We are continuing to monitor and assess the potential effects of new and existing tariffs in the United States as well as in other markets in which we operate. These tariffs have led to significant volatility and uncertainty in global markets and difficulty in forecasting demand. We have implemented and are continuing to implement and consider additional mitigation measures. The impact was not material to fiscal 2025 profitability and cash flows, however, even if we can minimize some of these impacts, we anticipate higher tariff rates to have an adverse effect on fiscal 2026 profitability and cash flows, and depending on actual rates and countries imposing tariffs such adverse impacts could be material.We continue to believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across product categories, brands, geographic regions, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths, such as our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications, and make us more productive and profitable. With the transition of leadership in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2025, we have embarked on "Beauty Reimagined," a strategic vision which focuses on accelerating best-in-class consumer coverage, creating transformative innovation, boosting consumer-facing investments, fueling sustainable growth through bold efficiencies and reimagining the way we work, including through the expansion of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan ("PRGP"), as discussed below. We continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; competitive pressures; legal and regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. We are also mindful of inflationary pressures (including those caused by tariffs) on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences, the impact of changes being made in the organization, including those related to Beauty Reimagined and the PRGP, as well as the potential impact of changes expected to be made as part of the PRGP on suppliers, retailers and others, and challenges relating to successfully outsourcing select services. In our outlook, we have made assumptions relating to these and other internal and external factors and challenges. Declines in net sales and profitability have, and may continue to, adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands, as well as long-lived assets, potentially resulting in impairments.In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued "Pillar Two" Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules for countries to enact into domestic law that would establish a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational companies. In certain countries that have enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax, it became effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2025. The estimated tax impact of such legislation has been included in the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and was not material. We are continuing to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of newly enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax in additional countries.On July 4, 2025, new U.S tax legislation was enacted. Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this legislation includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of certain business tax provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions becoming effective in fiscal 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new legislation. We are also monitoring certain provisions in global tax regulations that may expire during fiscal 2026, which, if not extended, could increase our effective tax rate.
32Table of ContentsRestructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth PlanAs announced on November 1, 2023, we launched the PRGP to help progressively rebuild our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.The PRGP is focused on rebuilding stronger, more sustainable profitability, supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing speed and agility. The plan is designed to improve gross margin, lower the cost base and reduce overhead expenses, while increasing investments in key consumer-facing activities. Upon completion of this plan, we expect to have improved our gross margin and expense base to drive greater operating leverage for the future.As a component of the PRGP, on February 5, 2024, we announced a two-year restructuring program. The restructuring program’s main focus included the reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas of our business as well as simplification and acceleration of processes. We committed to this course of action on February 1, 2024. In connection with the restructuring program, we estimated a net reduction in the range of approximately 1,800 to 3,000 positions globally, which was about 3-5% of our positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This reduction took into account the elimination of some positions as well as retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas.We planned to substantially complete specific initiatives under the restructuring program through fiscal 2026. We expected that the restructuring program would result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $500 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset write-offs and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives.After reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives, on February 3, 2025, we committed to the expansion of the PRGP, including an expansion of the restructuring program. The expansion of the overall PRGP is focused on three key areas. First, we plan to adopt a more competitive approach to procurement, a key pillar of savings, by further consolidating spending and strategically re-evaluating key supplier relationships. Second, we plan to further improve efficiencies within our supply chain network through a zero-waste approach, aiming to improve demand forecasting and innovation planning to minimize excess inventory and product destruction. Third, we are outsourcing select services to proven global partners. The expanded component of the restructuring program began during our fiscal 2025 third quarter with all initiatives to be approved by the end of fiscal 2026. Specific initiatives under the expanded component of the restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2027. The focus of the now expanded restructuring program (now, collectively the “Restructuring Program”) includes (i) reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas and (ii) simplification and acceleration of processes, along with the newly added focus on (i) outsourcing of select services and (ii) evolution of go-to-market footprint and selling models.In connection with the Restructuring Program, as of June 30, 2025 we estimate a net reduction in the range of approximately 5,800 to 7,000 positions globally, which is about 9-11% of our positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This net reduction takes into account the elimination of positions after retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. We expect that the Restructuring Program will result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $1,200 million and $1,600 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset-related costs, contract terminations and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives, which other than the non-cash charges, are expected to result in future cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations. Once fully implemented, we expect the Restructuring Program to yield annual target gross benefits of between $800 million and $1,000 million, before taxes, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities. The net benefits of the PRGP, which includes the Restructuring Program, are expected to enable a return to a double-digit operating margin over the next few years.Further information about the Restructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, is described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities.33Table of ContentsImpairment AnalysisDuring the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the TOM FORD brand experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels, including in mainland China, Asia travel retail and Hong Kong SAR. Also during the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels. As a result, we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit as compared to the prior-year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024. We concluded that the changes in circumstances in the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of the TOM FORD trademark and the Too Faced trademark and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, we performed interim impairment tests for the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademarks and Too Faced goodwill as well as a recoverability test for the Too Faced long-lived assets as of December 31, 2024. We concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method, and recorded an impairment charge of $773 million for TOM FORD and $75 million for Too Faced. We concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets for Too Faced were recoverable. Additionally, as a result of the interim impairment review, the remaining carrying value of Too Faced’s goodwill was not recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of $13 million, reducing the carrying value to zero. The significant assumptions used in the relief-from-royalty method include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 11.5% and 14%, respectively.Based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, we determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values. As it relates to Dr.Jart+, a decision was made in the prior year in the reporting unit’s operating plan to exit the travel retail channel. A revised strategy was implemented that included increased direct investment in other areas of the business, including in mainland China, to support the brand’s future growth. However, given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions in fiscal 2025, specifically within mainland China and Korea, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary which were finalized and approved in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter in connection with the brand’s annual planning process, and reflected in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025. The Too Faced reporting unit continued to experience lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels and, as such, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable.For purposes of calculating the estimated fair values of the trademark intangible assets, we utilized the relief-from-royalty method, and recorded an impairment charge of $83 million for Dr.Jart+ and $50 million for Too Faced. We then performed a recoverability analysis of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced long-lived asset groups and, based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups, concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets for Dr.Jart+ were not recoverable, whereas for Too Faced were recoverable. For purposes of calculating the impairment charge for the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+, the asset group was determined to be the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the asset group was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the asset group. As a result, the calculated impairment charge to be allocated to the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+ was $292 million. We concluded that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the multi-period excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental after-tax cash flows over multiple periods. The estimated fair value of all other long-lived assets of Dr. Jart+ exceeded their carrying values. As a result, the $292 million impairment charge was allocated entirely to the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset. The significant assumptions used in the calculations of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark and Dr.Jart+ customer list impairments include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the impairments was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.5% for Dr.Jart+ for both the trademark and customer list impairments, and 13.5% for Too Faced.34Table of ContentsA summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2025 and the remaining trademark, customer list and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2025, for the TOM FORD brand and the Too Faced and Dr.Jart+ reporting units, are as follows:Impairment Charges(1)Carrying Value(In millions)Three Months EndedJune 30, 2025Twelve Months EndedJune 30, 2025As of June 30, 2025Brand/Reporting UnitGeographic RegionTrademarkCustomer ListGoodwillTrademarkCustomer ListGoodwillTrademark(2)Customer ListGoodwillTOM FORDThe Americas$— $— $— $773 $— $— $1,805 $— $— Too FacedThe Americas50 — — 125 — 13 62 50 — Dr.Jart+(3)Asia/Pacific83 292 — 83 292 — 42 189 — Total$133 $292 $— $981 $292 $13 $1,909 $239 $— (1)The date of the fair value measurement for the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset was December 31, 2024. The dates of the fair value measurement for the Too Faced trademark intangible asset and Too Faced reporting unit were December 31, 2024 and April 1, 2025. The date of the fair value measurement for the Dr. Jart+ trademark intangible asset and asset group was April 1, 2025.(2)The carrying values of the trademark intangible assets, immediately subsequent to the impairment charges, are equal to their estimated fair values.(3)The carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ asset group, immediately subsequent to the customer list impairment charge, was equal to its estimated fair value.The impairment charge related to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset of $773 million was reflected in the fragrance, makeup and other product categories of $549 million, $170 million and $54 million, respectively. The trademark and goodwill impairment charges related to Too Faced were reflected in the makeup product category. The trademark and customer list impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ were reflected in the skin care product category. The aggregate trademark and customer list impairments are recorded in the Impairment of other intangible assets line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.Based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, the estimated fair value of the Too Faced and Dr.Jart+ trademarks were equal to their carrying value, immediately subsequent to the impairment charges taken in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. Additionally, the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ asset group was equal to its estimated fair value immediately subsequent to the impairment charges that were allocated to the customer list intangible asset.For the TOM FORD trademark, immediately subsequent to the impairment charges taken in the fiscal 2025 second quarter the estimated fair value of the trademark was equal to its carrying value. Based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, the estimated fair value of the TOM FORD trademark exceeded its carrying value of $1,805 million by 22%. This was primarily driven by a decrease of 150 basis points in the weighted average cost of capital as of April 1, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024. Using the December 31, 2024 weighted average cost of capital in the April 1, 2025 annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing would have caused the carrying value of the trademark to approximate its estimated fair value.Based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, the estimated fair values of the DECIEM trademarks exceeded their carrying values of $1,069 million by 3%. If all other assumptions are held constant, a decrease of 3% in the estimated future net sales, inclusive of the terminal value, or an increase of 20 basis points in the weighted average cost of capital, would have caused the carrying values of the trademarks to approximate their estimated fair values.The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units and their respective trademarks and long-lived assets are primarily predicated on the success of future new product launches, the ability to secure strategic price increases, the achievement of distribution expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not materialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environments where the reporting units operate, resulting changes in the key assumptions could negatively impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units and their respective trademarks and long-lived assets. This could potentially lead to recognizing additional impairment charges in the future.For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.35Table of ContentsU.S. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation AllowanceDuring fiscal 2025, we established a U.S. valuation allowance of $172 million against general foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards as it was determined more-likely-than-not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized. This determination was driven by our weighing of relevant evidence including lower U.S. taxable income in fiscal 2025 as compared to recent years, reflecting reduced income from our travel retail business, and the resulting uncertainty about the ability to realize the carryforwards prior to expiration. Our ability to recognize deferred tax assets, inclusive of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and other carryforwards is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets will not be required should our financial performance be negatively impacted in the future. Such valuation allowance could be material. Talcum Litigation Settlement AgreementsFrom the end of August 2024 through October 2024, we reached agreements with certain plaintiff law firms (collectively, the “talcum litigation settlement agreements”) for: (i) the resolution of pending cosmetic talcum powder matters handled by those firms as well as (ii) a process for resolving potential future cosmetic talcum powder claims expected to be brought on behalf of plaintiffs by those firms from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029, with annual capped amounts per year for each participating law firm. To account for the talcum litigation settlement agreements, we recorded a charge of $159 million during the fiscal 2025 first quarter for the amount agreed to settle the current claims and an estimated amount for potential future claims. Further information about the talcum litigation settlement agreements, is described in Item 8.

The decrease in skin care net sales was primarily driven by lower net sales from Estée Lauder and La Mer.By geographic region, reported net sales decreased across all geographic regions in fiscal 2025, primarily reflecting lower net sales in our travel retail business, and to a lesser extent, in mainland China, North America and Korea.The fiscal 2025 reported net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $28 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.Reported net sales decreased 8% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 10%. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase from pricing of 2%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions, partially offset by changes in mix.36Table of ContentsReturns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. Accordingly, the following discussions of Net sales by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 impacts of returns/(return adjustments) associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $(3) million and $1 million, respectively.Product CategoriesReported net sales for our product categories for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:Year Ended June 30,($ in millions)20252024$ Change% Change% Change in Constant Currency(1)Skin Care$6,962 $7,908 $(946)(12)%(12)%Makeup4,205 4,470 (265)(6)(5)Fragrance2,491 2,487 4 — — Hair Care565 629 (64)(10)(10)Other100 115 (15)(13)(13)14,323 15,609 (1,286)(8)(8)Returns associated with restructuring and other activities3 (1)4 100+100+Net sales$14,326 $15,608 $(1,282)(8)%(8)%(1)See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Skin CareReported skin care net sales decreased $946 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2025, reflecting lower net sales from Estée Lauder and La Mer, combined, of approximately $829 million, primarily driven by declines in our Asia travel retail business. The decrease in net sales from our Asia travel retail business reflected ongoing subdued sentiment and lower conversion from Chinese consumers, the difficult comparison to the prior year due to our resumption of replenishment orders in the fiscal 2024 third quarter and our strategic decision to reduce our exposure to reseller activity, as well as retailer shifts in strategies toward more profitable duty free business models in both Korea and mainland China, which led to lower replenishment orders.Also contributing to the decrease in net sales from Estée Lauder was lower net sales in mainland China, reflecting the overall challenging retail environment, including subdued consumer sentiment.Skin care net sales were impacted by approximately $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.Reported skin care net sales decreased 12% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 13%. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase from pricing of 1%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions, partially offset by changes in mix.MakeupReported makeup net sales decreased $265 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2025, reflecting lower net sales primarily from M·A·C, and to a lesser extent, Estée Lauder, Too Faced and Bobbi Brown, combined, of approximately $241 million. The decrease in net sales from M·A·C was primarily driven by lower net sales in the face subcategory and retail softness for the brand, which led to elevated levels of inventory and retailer destocking. Net sales from Estée Lauder decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales in the face subcategory, reflecting the aforementioned challenges in our Asia travel retail business. Net sales from Too Faced decreased, driven by North America, primarily reflecting lower net sales in the lip and eye subcategories. Bobbi Brown net sales decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales in the face subcategory. Partially offsetting the reported makeup net sales decrease were higher net sales from Clinique across all geographic regions, led by North America, reflecting higher net sales associated with the fiscal 2024 third quarter launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store, as well as the success of hero product franchises, including new product launches. 37Table of ContentsMakeup net sales were impacted by approximately $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.Reported makeup net sales decreased 6% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 9%. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase from pricing of 3%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions, partially offset by changes in mix.FragranceReported fragrance net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2025, reflecting higher net sales from Le Labo and to a lesser extent, KILIAN PARIS combined, of approximately $87 million, largely offset by lower net sales from Estée Lauder, Clinique, and TOM FORD, combined, of approximately $82 million. Net sales from Le Labo increased, reflecting growth from hero products, including growth through targeted expanded consumer reach, and new product launches. The increase in net sales from KILIAN PARIS primarily reflected the success of new product launches.The decrease in net sales from Estée Lauder was primarily driven by lower net sales from the Estée Lauder Beautiful and Estée Lauder Pleasures franchises. Net sales from Clinique decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales from the Clinique Happy franchise line of products. The decrease in net sales from TOM FORD was primarily driven by lower net sales in North America, reflecting softness in the brand's retail sales which led to elevated levels of inventory, resulting in retailer destocking, as well as an unfavorable year-over-year impact of prior-year launches.Fragrance net sales were impacted by approximately $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.Reported fragrance net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2025, driven by an increase from pricing of 6%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions and changes in mix, largely offset by the decrease from volume of 6%. Hair CareReported hair care net sales decreased $64 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2025, driven by lower net sales from Aveda, and to a lesser extent, Bumble and bumble and The Ordinary, combined of approximately $66 million. Net sales from Aveda decreased, primarily reflecting our softness in brick-and-mortar channels and freestanding store closures, partially offset by the impact from its launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store during the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. Net sales from Bumble and bumble decreased, primarily reflecting our softness in the salon and specialty-multi channels, partially offset by higher net sales associated with its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store. Hair care net sales were impacted by approximately $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.Reported hair care net sales decreased 10% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 10%. The impact of pricing was flat year-over-year, due to the favorable impact of strategic pricing actions offset by changes in mix.Geographic RegionsReported net sales by geographic region for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:Year Ended June 30,($ in millions)20252024$ Change% Change% Change in Constant Currency(1)The Americas$4,411 $4,581 $(170)(4)%(3)%Europe, the Middle East & Africa5,375 6,140 (765)(12)(13)Asia/Pacific4,537 4,888 (351)(7)(7)14,323 15,609 (1,286)(8)(8)Returns associated with restructuring and other activities3 (1)4 100+100+Net sales$14,326 $15,608 $(1,282)(8)%(8)%(1)See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.38Table of ContentsReported net sales decreased in fiscal 2025 across all geographic regions, primarily driven by lower net sales in our travel retail business, and to a lesser extent, in mainland China, North America and Korea, combined, of approximately $1,150 million. The decrease in net sales from our travel retail business, which is reported in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa geographic region, was primarily driven by Asia travel retail, reflecting ongoing subdued sentiment and lower conversion from Chinese consumers, the difficult comparison to the prior year due to our resumption of replenishment orders in the second half of fiscal 2024 and our strategic decision to reduce our exposure to reseller activity, as well as retailer shifts in strategies toward more profitable duty free business models in both Korea and mainland China, which led to lower replenishment orders.The decrease in net sales in mainland China reflected the overall challenging retail environment, including subdued consumer sentiment. The decrease in net sales in North America reflected ongoing retail softness for some brands, and pressure from subdued consumer confidence and sentiment in the second half of fiscal 2025, which led to elevated inventory levels and destocking at certain retailers, as well as the timing of shipments, which further pressured net sales compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting the net sales decline for North America in fiscal 2025 was the impact from the launch of eleven brands in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store as of June 2025 compared to three brands as of June 2024, as well as the launch of three brands in the Amazon.ca (Canada) Premium Beauty store in fiscal 2025.The net sales decline in Korea reflects the impact of political and social unrest, which reduced retail traffic and dampened retail sales, as well as the exit of Dr.Jart+ from the travel retail channel in Korea during the fiscal 2025 second quarter. Reported net sales in The Americas decreased 4% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 8% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1%. These decreases were partially offset by an increase from pricing of 6%, due to the favorable impact of strategic pricing actions and changes in mix.Reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa decreased 12% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 10% and a decrease from pricing of 3%. The decrease from pricing is due to changes in mix, partially offset by the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions.
Reported net sales in Asia/Pacific decreased 7% in fiscal 2025, driven by the decrease from volume of 12%. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase from pricing of 5%, due to the favorable impact from strategic pricing actions and changes in mix.39Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINGross margin in fiscal 2025 increased to 74.0% as compared with 71.7% in fiscal 2024.Fiscal 2025 vs. Fiscal 2024Favorable (Unfavorable) Basis PointsAs Reported:Mix of business(30)Obsolescence charges125 Manufacturing costs and other145 Foreign exchange transactions(10)Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities— As Reported Gross Margin Basis Point Variance230 Non-GAAP Financial Measure Adjustments:Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities— Non-GAAP Gross Margin Basis Point Variance230 The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2025 includes net benefits from the PRGP which drove overall favorability year-over-year, including the favorability within manufacturing costs and other and obsolescence charges. The impact year-over-year from manufacturing costs and other reflects the favorable impact of cost efficiencies within our global supply chain network, partially offset by the impact of inflation on our costs. Obsolescence charges decreased year-over-year, due to a reduction in excess inventory.

The decrease in net sales year-over-year is the primary driver of the increase in operating expense margin in fiscal 2025. This impact offset the expense reductions realized through our overall disciplined expense management across the business as well as initiatives as part of the PRGP. Partially offsetting these expense reductions were increased investments in consumer facing areas of the business to drive sales, including advertising, selling, promotion and store operating expenses. Additionally, general and administrative expenses declined reflecting benefits from the above noted disciplined expense management, however also reflected the year-over-year unfavorable impact of a change in policy related to local government subsidies in China.41Table of ContentsOPERATING RESULTSYear Ended June 30,($ in millions)20252024As Reported:Operating (loss) income$(785)$970 $ Change from prior year(1,755)(539)% Change from prior year(100+)%(36)%Operating Margin(5.5)%6.2 %Non-GAAP Financial Measure(1):% Change in operating (loss) income from the prior year adjusting for the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, talcum litigation settlement agreements and the change in fair value of DECIEM acquisition-related stock options inclusive of payroll tax(28)%(13)%(1)See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.The reported operating margin for fiscal 2025 decreased from the prior year, driven by the decrease in net sales as well as an increase in our operating expense margin, reflecting the unfavorable year-over-year impact of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments relating to TOM FORD, Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced, combined, of $1,286 million in fiscal 2025 compared with goodwill and other intangible asset impairments relating to Dr.Jart+ of $471 million in fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in gross margin, as discussed above.

Operating income from Estée Lauder decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in net sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales and disciplined advertising and promotional expense management. The decrease in operating income from La Mer was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales.Partially offsetting the decrease in reported skin care operating income in fiscal 2025 was lower cost of sales for the product category overall, driven by the aforementioned impacts disclosed in the consolidated gross margin discussion above, as well as the favorable year-over-year impact of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ of $96 million.MakeupReported makeup operating results decreased $534 million, or over 100%, in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by other intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2025 relating to TOM FORD and Too Faced, combined, of $295 million and a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2025 relating to Too Faced of $13 million, as well as the charge in the fiscal 2025 first quarter associated with the talcum litigation settlement agreements of $159 million. Also contributing to the reported makeup operating results decrease in fiscal 2025 was a decrease in operating income from Estée Lauder and M·A·C, combined, of approximately $124 million. The decrease in operating income from Estée Lauder was primarily driven by lower net sales and an increase in advertising and promotional activities to support new product launches, partially offset by lower cost of sales. Operating income from M·A·C decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in net sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales and disciplined advertising and promotional expense management. Partially offsetting the decrease in reported makeup operating results in fiscal 2025 was lower cost of sales for the product category overall, driven by the aforementioned impacts disclosed in the consolidated gross margin discussion above.43Table of ContentsFragranceReported fragrance operating results decreased $643 million, or over 100%, in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by lower operating results from TOM FORD, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in operating income from Jo Malone London, combined, of approximately $648 million. The decrease in operating results from TOM FORD was primarily driven by the fiscal 2025 other intangible asset impairment charge of $549 million, and to a lesser extent, a decline in net sales, as well as an increase in advertising and promotional activities and an increase in selling expenses to support sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales. The decrease in operating income from Jo Malone London was primarily driven by higher selling expenses, including higher staffing costs to support key campaigns and targeted expanded consumer reach, higher advertising and promotional activities to support key campaigns and higher store operating costs to support targeted expanded consumer reach, partially offset by an increase in net sales. Partially offsetting the decline in fragrance operating results in fiscal 2025 was lower cost of sales for the product category overall, driven by the aforementioned impacts disclosed in the consolidated gross margin discussion above.Hair CareReported hair care operating loss decreased $11 million or 21% in fiscal 2025, driven by lower operating expenses and cost of sales, partially offset by lower net sales.Geographic RegionsYear Ended June 30,($ in millions)20252024$ Change% Change(As Reported)% Change (Non-GAAP)(1)Non-GAAP Financial Measure(1)The Americas$(918)$34 $(952)(100+)%100+%Adjusted for the impact of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, talcum litigation settlement agreements and change in fair value of DECIEM acquisition-related stock optionsEurope, the Middle East & Africa610836(226)(27)(28)Asia/Pacific9 224 (215)(96)(45)Adjusted for the impact of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments(299)1,094 (1,393)(100+)(28)Charges associated with restructuring and other activities(486)(124)(362)(100+)(100+)Operating (loss) income$(785)$970 $(1,755)(100+)%(100+)%(1)See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.The decrease in reported operating results in fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by lower operating results in North America, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in operating income in mainland China and in our travel retail business, combined, of approximately $1,273 million. Operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in Europe, the Middle East & Africa is included in that region and in The Americas. This is primarily due to certain capabilities related to the travel retail business that are centralized in The Americas region and, as such, a component of the operating income generated by this business is transferred to The Americas through an intercompany royalty. The decrease in operating results in North America was primarily driven by other intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2025 relating to TOM FORD and Too Faced of $898 million and a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2025 relating to Too Faced of $13 million, the unfavorable year-over-year impact relating to net intercompany activity, including $334 million of lower intercompany royalty income due to the decline in income from our global travel retail business, the charge in the fiscal 2025 first quarter associated with the talcum litigation settlement agreements of $159 million, and a decrease in net sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales.The decrease in operating income in mainland China was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales and the year-over-year unfavorable impact of a change in policy related to local government subsidies in China.44Table of ContentsThe decrease in operating income from our travel retail business, which is reported in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year impact of net intercompany activity, including $334 million of lower intercompany royalty expense due to the decline in income, lower cost of sales, disciplined advertising and promotional expense management and lower shipping costs reflecting the decrease in net sales.INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME Year Ended June 30,(In millions)20252024Interest expense$357 $378 Interest income and investment income, net$114 $167 Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily reflecting a lower average debt balance compared to the prior year. Interest income and investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2025, primarily reflecting a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates compared to the prior year. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations, as well as changes to valuation allowance based on our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, changes to valuation allowance, the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions. Year Ended June 30,($ in millions)20252024(Loss) earnings before income taxes:$(1,040)$772 As Reported:Effective rate for income taxes(8.9)%47.0 %Basis-point change from prior year(5,590)1,930 Non-GAAP Financial Measure(1):Effective rate for income taxes38.8 %31.0 %(1)Excludes the net impact on the effective tax rates of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment and talcum litigation settlement agreements for fiscal 2025 and charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and changes in the fair value of DECIEM acquisition-related stock options inclusive of payroll tax for fiscal 2024. See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 decreased approximately 5,590 basis points. The decrease was primarily attributable to the higher effective tax rate on income from our foreign operations of approximately 2,630 basis points, due to our geographical mix of earnings for fiscal 2025, establishment of a valuation allowance against general foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 1,651 basis points, the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges associated with the Too Faced reporting unit of approximately 800 basis points and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation of approximately 640 basis points. The loss before income taxes due to the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, as well as the charges associated with restructuring and other activities and talcum litigation settlement agreements increased the impact of these tax adjustments.45Table of ContentsNET (LOSS) EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Year Ended June 30,($ in millions, except per share data)20252024As Reported:Net (loss) earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.$(1,133)$390 $ Change from prior year(1,523)(616)% Change from prior year(100+)%(61)%Diluted net (loss) earnings per common share$(3.15)$1.08 % Change from prior year(100+)%(61)%Non-GAAP Financial Measure(1):% Change in diluted net (loss) earnings per common share from the prior year adjusting for the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment, talcum litigation settlement agreements and the change in fair value of DECIEM acquisition-related stock options inclusive of payroll tax.(42)%(25)%(1)See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.46Table of ContentsRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial

borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,921 million compared with $3,395 million at June 30, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs, currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. We continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings. We do not believe that continuing to reinvest these remaining applicable foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.Inflation impacted our operating results during fiscal 2025 and we expect it to continue. Generally, we have plans to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies which we expect to offset some of these cost increases.Credit RatingsChanges in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facilities. Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. As of August 13, 2025, our long-term debt is rated A- with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A3 with a negative outlook by Moody’s.Debt and Access to LiquidityTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 65% and 59% at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For further information regarding our current and long-term debt and available financing, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Debt.Cash FlowsYear Ended June 30,(In millions)20252024Net cash provided by operating activities$1,272 $2,360 Net cash used for investing activities$(623)$(960)Net cash used for financing activities$(1,144)$(2,035)The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower net earnings in fiscal 2025, excluding non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities variances, including the impact from the significant reduction in inventory in the prior year, as compared to the reduction in inventory in the current year.The change in net cash flows used for investing activities was primarily driven by a favorable year-over-year impact from capital expenditure payments made relating to the manufacturing facility in Japan, near Tokyo, in the prior year.51Table of ContentsThe change in net cash flows used for financing activities primarily reflected the favorable year-over-year impacts of repayments of commercial paper in the prior year, payments associated with the purchase of the remaining interest in DECIEM during fiscal 2024 and a decrease in dividends paid to stockholders in the current year, partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of the repayment of long-term debt in the current year and issuance of long-term debt in the prior year.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 18 – Common Stock. Pension and Post-retirement Plan FundingSeveral factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans. For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions. The effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities. This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan. The following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans: Year Ended June 30,(In millions)Expected 202620252024Non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan benefit payments$30 $9 $8 International defined benefit pension plan contributions$32 $35 $24 Post-retirement plan benefit payments$9 $14 $13 Commitments and ContingenciesFor a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, see Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Fair value hedges, Cash Flow Hedges, Net Investment Hedges).Credit RiskFor a discussion of credit risk, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk).Market RiskWe address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, anticipated transactions and receivables and payables and the net investment in certain foreign operations. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $223 million and $371 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.We also enter into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and to hedge a portion of the net investment in certain foreign operations. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our cross-currency swap contracts would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $85 million and $49 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our funded indebtedness, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $43 million and $48 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.53Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2025 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical if the accounting estimate both (i) involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and (ii) has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting policies relate to Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets – Impairment Assessment, Dr.Jart+ Other Intangible Asset – Impairment and Income Taxes.Our management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets – Impairment Assessment and Dr.Jart+ Other Intangible Asset – ImpairmentGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the estimated fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we also have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the other indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be measured and recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value.For fiscal 2025 and 2024, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair values of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were below their carrying values. We considered macroeconomic factors including global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and the Company's intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.54Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2025 and 2024, a quantitative assessment was performed for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. To determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units, we used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we determined the estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples for the reporting unit. To determine the estimated fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we used an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and a royalty rate.For fiscal 2025, changes in circumstances at the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit indicated that the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including the customer list, were not recoverable. The Company first determines the asset group which is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The asset group was determined to be at the reporting unit level. Based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, the carrying amount of the long-lived assets for Dr.Jart+ were not recoverable. To calculate the impairment, the estimated fair value of the asset group was determined in the same manner as the quantitative assessment performed for goodwill described above, using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. Estimated fair values for each of the assets within the asset group were also determined. The calculated impairment loss for the asset group only reduces the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets of the group and is allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, however, the allocated impairment loss cannot reduce the carrying amount of a long-lived asset below its estimated fair value. As a result of the estimated fair values, the impairment charge was allocated entirely to the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset.For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and impairment of the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.Income TaxesWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. As the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.55Table of ContentsFor further discussion of Income Taxes, see Item 8.

(including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” /s/

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.F-3Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Interim Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessment – TOM FORD TrademarkAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $3,123 million as of June 30, 2025, of which $1,805 million relates to the TOM FORD trademark. Management assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Management concluded that the changes in circumstances in the TOM FORD brand, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for an interim impairment review of the TOM FORD trademark. Accordingly, management performed an interim impairment test as of December 31, 2024. Management concluded that the carrying value of the TOM FORD trademark exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $773 million. As disclosed by management, the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset was determined utilizing an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and a royalty rate.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment of the TOM FORD trademark is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the trademark; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the TOM FORD trademark. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the trademark; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the relief-from-royalty method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, the royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating management’s assumption related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the royalty rate and weighted average cost of capital significant assumptions.Annual Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessments – DECIEM TrademarksAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $3,123 million as of June 30, 2025, and as disclosed by management, $1,069 million relates to the DECIEM trademarks. Management assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Based on the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, management determined that the estimated fair values of the DECIEM trademarks exceeded their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the trademark intangible assets were determined utilizing an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates.F-4Table of ContentsThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments of the DECIEM trademarks is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the trademarks; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. manufactures, markets and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the world. Products are marketed under owned brand names, including: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, La Mer, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin Paris, TOM FORD, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, KILIAN PARIS, Too Faced, Dr.Jart+, The Ordinary and NIOD. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. is also the global licensee of the AERIN, BALMAIN and Dr. Andrew Weil brand names for beauty-related products.NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Certain amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.Management EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, business combinations and asset acquisitions, goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes and legal contingencies. Management evaluates the related estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, as relevant, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.Currency Translation and TransactionsAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange for the period. Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. were $90 million, $(135) million and $(85) million, net of tax, in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the Company’s subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, and these subsidiaries are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements or liquidity in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. The Company also uses cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. See Note 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.The accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings include net exchange gains on foreign currency transactions of $58 million, $77 million and $57 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.F-11Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include $1,017 million and $926 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.InvestmentsInvestments in the common stock of privately-held companies in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those equity securities without readily determinable fair values where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, the Company records them at cost, less impairment, plus/minus subsequent observable price changes, and performs an assessment each quarter to determine whether or not a triggering event has occurred that results in changes in fair value. Collectively, these investments were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 and are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, including credit losses, and customer deductions. Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.The Company is required to measure credit losses based on its estimate of expected losses rather than incurred losses, which generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. The Company evaluates certain criteria, including aging and historical write-offs, the current economic condition of specific customers and future economic conditions of countries utilizing a consumption index to determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Company writes-off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws. See Note 15 – Revenue Recognition for additional information.Inventory and Promotional MerchandiseInventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity. Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred. Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers. Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age and historical results. In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves may be established for future known or anticipated events.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (iii) designated as a hedge of a net investment in certain foreign operations ("net investment" hedge), or (iv) not designated as a hedging instrument. F-12Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor each derivative contract entered into, where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, net investments in certain foreign operations, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. At inception, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively, and has elected to perform, after initial evaluation, qualitative effectiveness assessments of certain hedge relationships to support an ongoing expectation of high effectiveness, if effectiveness testing is required. If based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments). For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of a derivative of a forecasted transaction are recorded in OCI. Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The net gain or loss on these contracts is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company’s investment. For derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are reported in current-period earnings. All derivative gains and losses relating to fair value hedges and cash flow hedges are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged items. Cash flows from derivatives are classified within the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the items being hedged. The cross-currency swap contracts designated as fair value hedges are classified within financing activities. The cross-currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified within investing activities. The foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified within investing activities, except the portion related to the excluded component which is classified within operating activities. Cash flows, and their related gains and losses, from the remaining derivative instruments are classified within operating activities.From a consolidated balance sheet perspective, derivatives with fair values in a net asset position are bifurcated based on the cash flows expected to occur within the next twelve months (current asset or liability) and those expected to occur beyond twelve months (noncurrent asset or liability). Derivatives with fair values in a net liability position are classified in total as current, regardless of the maturity date.See Note 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages. Costs incurred for website development are capitalized within each applicable development stage as required. Capital costs incurred while an asset is being built, including any applicable interest costs, are classified as construction in progress and are reclassified to its respective asset class when placed into service. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.F-13Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSBusiness Combinations and Asset AcquisitionsThe Company evaluates whether a transaction meets the definition of a business. The Company first applies a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, the Company further considers whether the set of assets or acquired entities have at a minimum, inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs in the form of revenue. If the assets or acquired entities meet this criteria, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The Company recognizes assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities assumed or issued as part of the transaction. Neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition; any excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the opposite, is allocated to qualifying assets based on their relative fair values. The determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows, discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies, among other things. See Note 5 – Asset Acquisition for further information.Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible AssetsGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the estimated fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.The Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company’s operating segments. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the other indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.See Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.F-14Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLong-Lived AssetsThe Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets subject to amortization, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be measured and recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. The calculated impairment loss for an asset group only reduces the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets of the group and is allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, however, the allocated impairment loss cannot reduce the carrying amount of a long-lived asset below its estimated fair value.LeasesThe Company recognizes a lease liability and a related right-of-use (“ROU”) asset at the commencement date for leases on its consolidated balance sheet, excluding short-term leases as noted below. The lease liability is equal to the present value of unpaid lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s lease term at the commencement date may reflect options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. To determine the present value of the lease liability, if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate, which is defined as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow (on a collateralized basis over a similar term) an amount equal to the lease payments in similar economic environments. The ROU asset is based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for certain items such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. Both operating and finance lease ROU assets are reviewed for impairment, consistent with other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. After an ROU asset is impaired, any remaining balance of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life.After the lease commencement date, the Company evaluates lease modifications, if any, that could result in a change in the accounting for leases. For a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in the accounting of an existing lease. In addition, significant changes in events or circumstances within the Company’s control are assessed to determine whether a change in the accounting for leases is required.For lease modifications that result in partial termination of the lease, the Company has elected the proportional method whereby the carrying amount of the ROU asset is decreased in proportion with the full or partial termination of the lease based on the adjustment to the carrying value of the lease liability. Certain of the Company’s leases provide for variable lease payments for the right to use an underlying asset that vary due to changes in facts and circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or rate (e.g., Consumer Price Index) are included in the initial measurement of the lease liability, the initial measurement of the ROU asset, and the lease classification test based on the index or rate as of the commencement date. Any changes from the commencement date estimation of the index- and rate-based variable payments are expensed as incurred in the period of the change. Variable lease payments that are not known at the commencement date and are determinable based on the performance or use of the underlying asset, are not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability or the ROU asset, but instead are expensed as incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, common area maintenance and real estate taxes based on the percentage of the total square footage leased by the Company, as well as variable costs relating to embedded leases, such as third-party manufacturing and logistics agreements.Certain of the Company’s contracts contain lease components as well as non-lease components, such as an agreement to purchase services. For purposes of allocating contract consideration, the Company does not separate the lease components from non-lease components for all asset classes. Short-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of 12 months or less) are not recorded as ROU assets or lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and the related lease payments are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.F-15Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor certain leases relating to automobiles, information technology equipment and office equipment, the Company utilizes the portfolio approach. Under this approach, the Company combines and accounts for leases with similar characteristics (e.g., lease term, discount rates, etc.) as a single lease (as a portfolio), provided its application is not materially different when compared to the application at the individual lease level.See Note 7 – Leases for further information.Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and seller of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The Company’s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, duty-free retailers, specialty multi retailers, online pure players, perfumeries and pharmacies, and salons and spas. The Company grants credit to qualified customers. While the Company does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk at this time, it continues to monitor its customers' abilities, individually and collectively, to make timely payments.Revenue RecognitionPerformance ObligationsThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product and other promised goods and services to a customer. The Company sells wholesale to customers in distribution channels that include department stores, travel retail, specialty-multi retailers, perfumeries and pharmacies, salons/spas and through various online sites operated by authorized retailers, including pure-play sites. The primary performance obligation related to these channels of distribution is product sales where revenue is recognized as control of the product transfers to the customer. In the Americas region, revenue is generally recognized at the time the product is made available and provided to the customer’s carrier at the Company’s location, and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, revenue is generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. The Company has certain arrangements with customers whereby it is responsible for shipping and handling through the named place of destination, which occurs after the customer has obtained control. As a result, the Company has made a policy election that permits the Company to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised service. For these arrangements, the Company accrues all shipping and handling expenses related to the shipped products in the period that the revenue is recognized.The Company also sells direct to consumers across freestanding stores, its brands' websites and through third-party online platforms. At Company-operated freestanding stores, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred at the point of sale. Revenue from online sales is recognized when control of the product is transferred, generally based upon the consumer’s receipt. In connection with the sale of product, the Company may provide other promised goods and services that are deemed to be performance obligations. These are comprised of gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotions, customer loyalty program obligations, gift cards and other promotional products including samples and testers. The Company provides gift with purchase promotional products to certain customers generally without additional charge and also provides purchase with purchase promotional products to certain customers at a discount in relation to prices charged for saleable product. Revenue is allocated between saleable product, gift with purchase product and purchase with purchase product based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is deferred and ultimately recognized based on the timing differences, if any, between when control of these promotional products and control of the related saleable products transfer to the Company’s customer (e.g., a third-party retailer), which is calculated based on the weighted-average number of days between promotional periods. The estimated standalone selling price allocated to these promotional products is based on a cost plus margin approach. F-16Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Company offers a number of different loyalty programs to its customers across brands, regions and distribution channels including points-based programs, tier-based programs and other programs. Revenue is allocated between the saleable product revenue and the material right loyalty obligations based on relative standalone selling prices when the consumer purchases the products that are earning them the right to the future benefits. Deferred revenue related to the Company’s loyalty programs is estimated based on the standalone selling price and is adjusted for an estimated breakage factor. Standalone selling price is determined primarily using the observable market price of the good or service benefit if it is sold by the Company or a cost plus margin approach for goods/services not directly sold by the Company. Breakage rates consider historical patterns of redemption and/or expiration. Revenue is recognized when the benefits are redeemed or expire. The Company also offers gift cards through Company-operated freestanding stores and Company-owned websites. The related deferred revenue is estimated based on expected breakage that considers historical patterns of redemption taking into consideration escheatment laws as applicable. In situations where promotional products are provided by the Company to its customers at the same time as the related saleable product, such as shipments of samples and testers, the cost of these promotional products are recognized as a cost of sales at the same time as the related revenue is recognized and no deferral of revenue is required. Product Returns, Sales Incentives and Other Forms of Variable Consideration In measuring revenue and determining the consideration the Company is entitled to as part of a contract with a customer, the Company takes into account the related elements of variable consideration. Such elements of variable consideration include product returns and sales incentives, such as volume rebates and discounts, markdowns, margin adjustments and early-payment discounts. The Company also enters into arrangements containing other forms of variable consideration and makes payments to certain of its customers related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction. These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration and the fair value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s share of the demonstration and advertising costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings, and for counter construction, the costs are capitalized into property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives into Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. When the Company does not receive a distinct good or service or for which the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service in these types of arrangements, the adjustments to revenue are recorded at the later of when (i) the Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer, or (ii) the Company pays, or promises to pay, the consideration.For the sale of goods with a right of return, the Company only recognizes revenue for the consideration it expects to be entitled to (considering the products to be returned) and records a sales return accrual within Other accrued liabilities for the amount it expects to credit back its customers. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset included in Inventory and promotional merchandise and a corresponding adjustment to Cost of sales for the right to recover goods from customers associated with the estimated returns. The sales return accrual and corresponding asset include estimates that directly impact reported net sales. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an estimate for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, as necessary, sales return accruals and the related assets may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of the Company’s customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and the Company’s decision to continue to support new and existing products. The Company estimates sales incentives and other variable consideration using the most likely amount method and records accruals within Other accrued liabilities when control of the related product is transferred to the customer. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific facts and circumstances related to the current period.See Note 15 – Revenue Recognition for further discussion and revenue disaggregated by geographic region. For revenue disaggregated by product category see Note 24 – Segment Data and Related Information.F-17Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSRoyalty Revenue - License ArrangementsAs a result of the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, the Company entered into license arrangements with the Marcolin Group (“Marcolin”) and Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. (“Zegna”). As part of these arrangements, the Company licensed the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear (“Eyewear”) to Marcolin and for fashionwear (“Fashion”) to Zegna. Licensing the TOM FORD trademark to customers represents a revenue-generating activity in the ordinary course of business for the Company. The Company’s performance obligation is to license the TOM FORD trademark to Marcolin and to Zegna, which grants them the right to access the symbolic intellectual property. The licensing arrangements stipulate that licensees must pay a sales-based royalty, with a guaranteed minimum, to the Company. The Company satisfies its performance obligation over the license period as it fulfills its promise to grant the licensees rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property, as well as maintain the intellectual property. As such, revenue for both the Marcolin and Zegna arrangements is recognized over time. Royalty payments are collected on a quarterly basis. The Company expects the guaranteed minimum royalty amounts to be exceeded and, as a result, sales-based royalties will be recognized in the period in which the sales occur. The upfront payment received from Marcolin is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the license. See Note 5 – Asset Acquisition and Note 15 - Revenue Recognition for further information regarding the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand and related revenue recognition impacts.Advertising and PromotionGlobal net advertising, marketing, promotion and product development expenses of $3,643 million, $3,657 million and $3,711 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and are expensed as incurred. The cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs of $316 million, $360 million and $344 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and are expensed as incurred.Shipping and HandlingShipping and handling expenses of $729 million, $792 million and $838 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and include distribution center costs, promotional shipping costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.Royalty Fees - License ArrangementsThe Company’s license agreements where it is the licensee provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks. The Company's current license arrangements have an initial term of approximately 3 years to 10 years, and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license agreement provisions. As of June 30, 2025, the remaining terms considering available renewal periods range from 1 year to approximately 25 years. Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.Certain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities. Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.F-18Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSStock-Based CompensationThe Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements, net of estimated forfeitures. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.Income TaxesThe Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. As the application of various tax laws relevant to the Company’s global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s annual tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for realizability and establishes valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If the Company’s assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time. The Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated net earnings.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in DECIEM, a Toronto-based skin care company. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's equity interest and was considered a step acquisition. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (“Call Option”), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (“Put Option”), the remaining interests after a three-year period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the “net Put (Call) Option”).F-19Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAs a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‑date fair value, that was classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Each reporting period, an adjustment, if any, is then recorded to adjust the noncontrolling interest to the higher of either the redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. If and when applicable, these adjustments are recorded in Paid-in capital and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. In addition, based on the Company's policy election, if the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on a cumulative basis, an adjustment is recorded in Retained earnings and the Company will adjust Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. as required by the two-class method when calculating net earnings per common share. Prior to May 31, 2024, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest per share was calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo method: risk-free rate, term to mid of last twelve-month period, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount rate, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility and net sales volatility. The Company was not required to record any adjustments, as described above.On May 31, 2024, the Company purchased the remaining interest of approximately 24% on a fully diluted basis in DECIEM at a contractually calculated amount pursuant to the terms of the net Put (Call) Option, which resulted in the settlement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest and DECIEM stock options for $743 million and $114 million, respectively. Transaction costs associated with the purchase were $2 million and were recorded as an adjustment to Paid-in capital. As this purchase did not result in a change in control of DECIEM, the change in ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction. Differences between the balance of the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the date of redemption of the remaining interests and the consideration paid were recognized in Paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. As such, any adjustments in the consideration paid will be recognized in Paid-in capital. Payments for the acquisition of redeemable noncontrolling interest, inclusive of transaction costs, are classified as financing activities and payments to settle the DECIEM stock option liability are classified within operating activities within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. As of June 30, 2025, the consideration paid to acquire the remaining interest is subject to the final calculation of the purchase price pursuant to the contract. These adjustments are not expected to be material.See Note 19 – Stock Programs for additional information relating to the DECIEM stock options.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsFASB ASU No. 2022-04 – Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program ObligationsIn September 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The guidance requires companies that use supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations.Effective for the Company – The guidance became effective for the Company’s first quarter fiscal 2024 and has been applied on a retrospective basis, except for the requirement to disclose rollforward information annually which became effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 Form 10-K and has been applied on a prospective basis.Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company has supplier financing arrangements and applied the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments. Such information is included within Note 10 – Supplier Finance Programs.F-20Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFASB ASU No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment DisclosuresIn November 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. Companies are required to disclose significant segment expenses by reportable segment if they are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). Companies are also required to disclose other segment items by reportable segment. The guidance clarifies that companies may disclose more than one measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM, provided that at least one of the reported measures includes the segment profit or loss measure that is most consistent with U.S. GAAP measurement principles. All existing annual disclosures about segment profit or loss, as well as the new requirements, must now be provided on an interim basis. Additionally, on an annual basis, the CODM’s title and position is required, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) and other disclosures. The guidance does not change how companies identify their operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments.Effective for the Company – The guidance became effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 Form 10-K and has been applied on a retrospective basis and will be applied in interim periods beginning in the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2026.Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company applied the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments. See Note 24 – Segment Data and Related Information for further discussion.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsFASB ASU No. 2025-05: Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets (Topic 326)In July 2025, the FASB issued guidance related to the estimation of expected credit losses for current accounts receivable and current contract assets. The amendment allows entities to elect a practical expedient to assume that current conditions as of the balance sheet date do not change for the remaining life of the asset in the development of a reasonable and supportable forecast as part of estimating expected credit losses. Entities electing the practical expedient are still required to adjust historical loss information to reflect current conditions to the extent that historical loss information does not reflect current conditions. An entity that elects to use the practical expedient is required to disclose that fact.Effective for the Company: The guidance becomes effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2027 and is applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted.Impact on consolidated financial statements: The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its accounts receivable balance and consolidated financial statement disclosures.FASB ASU No. 2024-03 and 2025-01 – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40)In November 2024 and January 2025, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring disclosures, in a tabular format in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, on the disaggregation of relevant expense captions that are included on the face of the consolidated statement of (loss) earnings within continuing operations. The relevant expense captions are required to be disaggregated into natural expense categories including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. The guidance also requires certain expenses, gains or losses that require disclosure under existing U.S. GAAP, and that are recorded in a relevant expense caption on the face of the consolidated statement of (loss) earnings, to be presented in the same tabular disclosure. Qualitative disclosures about any remaining amounts in relevant expense line items are required as well. In addition, companies are required to disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, on an annual basis, how it defines selling expenses.Effective for the Company: The guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2028 Form 10-K and then in interim periods beginning in the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2029. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted.Impact on consolidated financial statements: The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.FASB ASU No. 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax DisclosuresIn December 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend and enhance existing annual income tax disclosures primarily focusing on two reporting areas: (1) greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliations and (2) disclosure of income taxes paid, disaggregated by applicable jurisdiction.F-21Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCompanies are required to use specific categories to prepare and disclose a tabular rate reconciliation (using both percentages and reporting currency amounts) of:•the reported income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations and the product of the income (or loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate of the jurisdiction of domicile; and•reconciling items within certain categories that are equal to or greater than a specified quantitative threshold, including the nature, effect, and underlying causes of the reconciling items and the judgment used in categorizing the reconciling items.The guidance also requires companies to disclose the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions including individual jurisdictions with amounts paid equal to or greater than a specified quantitative threshold. The guidance also codifies existing SEC rules that require companies to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign as well as income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions.Effective for the Company – The guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 Form 10-K.

NOTE 5 – ASSET ACQUISITIONFiscal 2023On April 28, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in 001 Del LLC (“001”) in exchange for $2,550 million in consideration (the “TOM FORD Acquisition”). 001 is the sole owner of the TOM FORD brand and its related intellectual property. The TOM FORD brand is a luxury brand created in 2005, and this acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company’s TOM FORD BEAUTY brand, which the Company has historically licensed, while simultaneously enabling the Company to create new licensing revenue streams. At the same time as the Company's transaction, an affiliate of Zegna separately purchased the interests in the TOM FORD fashion business that Zegna and its affiliates did not own (including the purchase of interests from the sellers of 001).The TOM FORD Acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The acquisition of 001 included existing license relationships for certain uses of the brand name, which were modified, terminated or otherwise renegotiated in connection with the transaction, and are discussed separately in Note 15 – Revenue Recognition. The total cost of the asset acquisition is $2,578 million, inclusive of approximately $28 million of transaction related costs and $300 million of deferred consideration payable to the sellers of which $150 million was paid in July 2025, and is reflected in Other accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2025, and the remaining $150 million is due in July 2026 and reflected in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025.The total cost of the asset acquisition was allocated to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset.

The trademark acquired in connection with the TOM FORD Acquisition is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the trademark was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input was the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.Other intangible assets consist of the following:June 30, 2025June 30, 2024(In millions)GrossCarryingValueAccumulatedAmortizationTotal NetBook ValueGrossCarryingValueAccumulatedAmortizationTotal NetBook ValueAmortizable intangible assets:      Customer lists and other$1,984 $1,348 $636 $1,971 $895 $1,076 Non-amortizable intangible assets:Trademarks3,123 4,107 Total other intangible assets, net$3,759 $5,183 The aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $131 million, $144 million and $145 million, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal(In millions)20262027202820292030Estimated aggregate amortization expense$107 $90 $73 $71 $69 Fiscal 2025 Impairment AnalysisFor further information on the Company's policies relating to its impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, see Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets within Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.During the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the TOM FORD brand experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels, including in mainland China, Asia travel retail and Hong Kong SAR. Also during the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels. As a result, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit as compared to the prior-year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024. F-25Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of the TOM FORD trademark and the Too Faced trademark and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademarks and Too Faced goodwill as well as a recoverability test for the Too Faced long-lived assets as of December 31, 2024. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method, and recorded an impairment charge of $773 million for TOM FORD and $75 million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets for Too Faced were recoverable. Additionally, as a result of the interim impairment review, the remaining carrying value of Too Faced’s goodwill was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $13 million, reducing the carrying value to zero. The significant assumptions used in the relief-from-royalty method include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 11.5% and 14%, respectively.Based on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values. As it relates to Dr.Jart+, a decision was made in the prior year in the reporting unit’s operating plan to exit the travel retail channel. A revised strategy was implemented that included increased direct investment in other areas of the business, including in mainland China, to support the brand’s future growth. However, given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions in fiscal 2025, specifically within mainland China and Korea, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary which were finalized and approved in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter in connection with the brand’s annual planning process, and reflected in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025. The Too Faced reporting unit continued to experience lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels and as such, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable.For purposes of calculating the estimated fair values of the trademark intangible assets, the Company utilized the relief-from-royalty method and recorded an impairment charge of $83 million for Dr.Jart+ and $50 million for Too Faced. The Company then performed a recoverability analysis of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced long-lived asset groups and, based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups, concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets for Dr.Jart+ were not recoverable, whereas for Too Faced were recoverable. For purposes of calculating the impairment charge for the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+, the asset group was determined to be the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the asset group was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the asset group. As a result, the calculated impairment charge to be allocated to the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+ was $292 million. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the multi-period excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental after-tax cash flows over multiple periods. The estimated fair value of all other long-lived assets of Dr. Jart+ exceeded their carrying values. As a result, the $292 million impairment charge was allocated entirely to the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset. The significant assumptions used in the calculations of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark and Dr.Jart+ customer list impairments include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the impairments was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.5% for Dr.Jart+ for both the trademark and customer list impairments, and 13.5% for Too Faced.F-26Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSA summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2025 and the remaining trademark, customer list and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2025, for the TOM FORD brand and the Too Faced and Dr.Jart+ reporting units, are as follows:Impairment Charges(1)Carrying Value(In millions)Three Months EndedJune 30, 2025Twelve Months EndedJune 30, 2025As of June 30, 2025Brand/Reporting UnitGeographic RegionTrademarkCustomer ListGoodwillTrademarkCustomer ListGoodwillTrademark(2)Customer ListGoodwillTOM FORDThe Americas$— $— $— $773 $— $— $1,805 $— $— Too FacedThe Americas50 — — 125 — 13 62 50 — Dr.Jart+(3)Asia/Pacific83 292 — 83 292 — 42 189 — Total$133 $292 $— $981 $292 $13 $1,909 $239 $— (1)The date of the fair value measurement for the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset was December 31, 2024.

The trademark and goodwill impairment charges related to Too Faced were reflected in the makeup product category. The trademark and customer list impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ were reflected in the skin care product category. The aggregate trademark and customer list impairments are recorded in the Impairment of other intangible assets line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.Fiscal 2024 Impairment AnalysisBased on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit and trademark exceeded their estimated fair values. Given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions, the reporting unit has made a strategic shift in its operating plan to exit the travel retail channel. This revised strategy also includes increased direct investment in other areas of the business, including in mainland China, to support the brand’s future growth. As a result of these changes in strategy, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit which were finalized and approved in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, and reflected in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of its respective long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $180 million. The Company then performed a recoverability analysis of the Dr.Jart+ long-lived asset group and, based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. As the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $291 million. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, comparable market multiples for the reporting unit, and royalty rate for the trademark.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $21 million reducing the carrying value to zero. During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $100 million for Dr.Jart+ and $86 million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The estimated fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units.

NOTE 8 – CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIVITIESRestructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth PlanAs announced on November 1, 2023, the Company launched the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan ("PRGP"), to help progressively rebuild its profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The PRGP is focused on rebuilding stronger, more sustainable profitability, supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing speed and agility. The plan is designed to improve gross margin, lower the cost base and reduce overhead expenses, while increasing investments in key consumer-facing activities. Upon completion of this plan, the Company expects to have improved its gross margin and expense base to drive greater operating leverage for the future.As a component of the PRGP, on February 5, 2024, the Company announced a two-year restructuring program. The restructuring program’s main focus included the reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas of the Company as well as simplification and acceleration of processes. The Company committed to this course of action on February 1, 2024. In connection with the restructuring program, the Company estimated a net reduction in the range of approximately 1,800 to 3,000 positions globally, which was about 3-5% of its positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This reduction took into account the elimination of some positions as well as retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. The Company planned to substantially complete specific initiatives under the restructuring program through fiscal 2026. The Company expected that the restructuring program would result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $500 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset-related costs, contract terminations and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives.After reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives, on February 3, 2025, the Company committed to the expansion of the PRGP, including an expansion of the restructuring program. The expansion of the overall PRGP is focused on three key areas. First, the Company plans to adopt a more competitive approach to procurement, a key pillar of savings, by further consolidating spending and strategically re-evaluating key supplier relationships. Second, the Company plans to further improve efficiencies within its supply chain network through a zero-waste approach, aiming to improve demand forecasting and innovation planning to minimize excess inventory and product destruction. Third, the Company is outsourcing select services to proven global partners. The expanded component of the restructuring program began during the Company’s fiscal 2025 third quarter with all initiatives to be approved by the end of fiscal 2026. Specific initiatives under the expanded component of the restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2027. The focus of the now expanded restructuring program (now, collectively the “Restructuring Program”) includes (i) reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas and (ii) simplification and acceleration of processes, along with the newly added focus on (i) outsourcing of select services and (ii) evolution of go-to-market footprint and selling models.F-31Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn connection with the Restructuring Program, as of June 30, 2025 the Company estimates a net reduction in the range of approximately 5,800 to 7,000 positions globally, which is about 9-11% of its positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This net reduction takes into account the elimination of positions after retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. The Company expects that the Restructuring Program will result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $1,200 million and $1,600 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset-related costs, contract terminations and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives, which other than the non-cash charges, are expected to result in future cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations.

The PCBA Program’s main areas of focus included accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of the Company’s distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company’s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. As of June 30, 2025, the net reduction of positions over the duration of the PCBA Program was approximately 2,800 positions globally. This reduction included the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. As of June 30, 2025, over the duration of the PCBA program, the Company closed approximately 16% of its freestanding stores.The Company approved specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and has substantially completed those initiatives. Inclusive of approvals from inception through June 30, 2022, the PCBA Program resulted in related restructuring and other charges totaling approximately $426 million, before taxes, through June 30, 2025.Specific actions taken during the PCBA Program include:•Optimize Digital Organization and Other Go-To-Market Organizations – The Company approved initiatives to enhance its go-to-market capabilities and shift more resources to support online growth. These initiatives resulted in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities. •Optimize Select Marketing, Brand and Global Functions – The Company reduced its corporate and certain of its brand office footprints, by restructuring where and how its employees work and collaborate. In addition, the Company approved initiatives to reduce organizational complexity and leverage scale across various Global functions. These actions resulted in asset write-offs, employee severance, lease termination fees, and consulting and other professional services for the design and implementation of the future structures and processes.•Optimize Distribution Network – To help restore profitability to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in certain areas of its distribution network and, as part of a broader initiative to be completed in phases, the Company approved initiatives to close a number of underperforming freestanding stores, counters and other retail locations, mainly in certain affiliates across all geographic regions, including the Company's travel retail network. These closures reflected changing consumer behaviors including higher demand for online and omnichannel capabilities. These activities resulted in product returns, termination of contracts, a net reduction in workforce, and inventory and other asset write-offs.•Exit of the Global Distribution of BECCA Products – In reviewing the Company's brand portfolio to improve efficiency and the sustainability of long-term investments, the decision was made to exit the global distribution of BECCA products due to its limited distribution, the ongoing decline in product demand and the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These activities resulted in charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, product returns, termination of contracts, and employee severance. •Exit of Certain Designer Fragrance Licenses – In reviewing the Company’s brand portfolio of fragrances and to focus on investing its resources on alternative opportunities for long-term growth and value creation globally, the Company announced that it would not renew its license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines when their respective terms expired in June 2023. The Company negotiated early termination agreements with each of the licensors effective June 30, 2022. These actions resulted in asset write-offs, including charges for the impairment of goodwill, employee-related costs, and consulting and legal fees.F-35Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS•Brand Transformation – In reviewing the Company’s brand portfolio to accelerate growth within the makeup product category and to support long-term investments, the decision was made to strategically reposition Smashbox to capitalize on changing consumer preferences and to mitigate the impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the brand.

Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this legislation includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of certain business tax provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions becoming effective in fiscal 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new legislation.On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, including a tax provision implementing a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income. The corporate alternative minimum tax did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024.On July 20, 2020, the U.S. government released final and proposed regulations under the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the TCJA that provide for a high-tax exception to the GILTI tax. These regulations are retroactive to the original enactment of the GILTI tax provision, commencing with the Company's 2019 fiscal year. The Company has elected to apply the GILTI high-tax exception beginning with fiscal 2019 through 2024, and intends to make the election for fiscal 2025. In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued "Pillar Two" Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules for countries to enact into domestic law that would establish a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational companies. In certain countries that have enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax, it became effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2025. The estimated tax impact of such legislation has been included in the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and was not material. The Company is continuing to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of newly enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax in additional countries. F-38Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOn August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. The decision related to the TCJA deduction for certain deemed foreign dividends otherwise subject to the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of applicable foreign subsidiaries. Based on the Company's evaluation of the technical merits of this decision, the Company has filed a protective refund claim with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. At this time the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that such income tax benefit will not be sustained. The Company has accrued a $73 million estimated tax benefit in the provision for income taxes, offset by an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the estimated $73 million Transition Tax at issue. As a result, there was no net impact to the provision for income taxes and accompanying consolidated statement of (loss) earnings, or to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended June 30, 2025. A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s actual effective tax rate on (loss) earnings before income taxes is as follows:Year Ended June 30,202520242023Provision for income taxes at statutory rate21.0 %21.0 %21.0 %Increase (decrease) due to(1):State and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit(0.2)1.1 0.3 Stock-based compensation arrangements – excess tax expense (benefits), net(3.4)3.0 (0.8)Taxation of foreign operations(10.4)15.9 8.6 Income tax reserve adjustments0.3 (0.4)(0.1)Nondeductible goodwill impairment charges(0.1)7.9 — U.S. research and development tax credit1.2 (2.2)(0.9)Changes in valuation allowance(16.5)— — Other, net(0.8)0.7 (0.4)Effective tax rate(2)(8.9)%47.0 %27.7 %(1)In fiscal 2025, as a result of the loss before income taxes, all reconciling items that are income tax expenses are presented as decreases to the rate, and all reconciling items that are income tax benefits are presented as increases to the rate.(2)For fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, the reconciling items between the Company's U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's actual effective tax rate were materially impacted by the decrease in earnings before income taxes from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 and from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, respectively. Income tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company’s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including the impact of tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. The Company recognized $35 million and $23 million of income tax expense for tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, as compared to $11 million of excess tax benefits, net as a reduction to the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.The Company has $4,466 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2025. Included in this amount is approximately $1,117 million of earnings considered permanently reinvested for which no deferred income taxes have been provided. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, the Company would be subject to approximately $77 million in taxes, primarily related to foreign withholding taxes as well as additional state and local income taxes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with a planned change in the Company's legal entity structure that exempts foreign withholding tax on certain undistributed earnings, the Company changed its assertion regarding its ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and determined that $5,548 million of undistributed earnings of such foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. The federal, state, local and foreign deferred income tax impact of this change was not material.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $499 million, of which $1,018 million is included in Other assets and $519 million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, certain subsidiaries had $972 million and $657 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, the tax effect of which was $213 million and $170 million, respectively, as well as U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of $172 million and $180 million, respectively, and state and local tax credit carryforwards of $11 million and $8 million, respectively. With the exception of $436 million of net operating losses with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2025, these net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2039. The state and local tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2029. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $454 million and $238 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, principally against certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. During fiscal 2025, the Company established a U.S. valuation allowance of $172 million against general foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards as it was determined more-likely-than-not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized. This determination was driven by the Company's weighing of relevant evidence including lower U.S. taxable income in fiscal 2025 as compared to recent years, reflecting reduced income from its travel retail business, and the resulting uncertainty about the ability to realize the carryforwards prior to expiration.As of June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $140 million, $65 million, and $63 million, respectively. At June 30, 2025, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $133 million. The increase in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2025 as compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to having established an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the Transition Tax at issue based on the August 26, 2024 U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian v. Commissioner, as discussed above.F-40Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The total gross accrued interest and penalty expense recorded during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings was $2 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2025 and 2024 was $19 million and $17 million, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: June 30,(In millions)202520242023Balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year$65 $63 $61 Gross amounts of increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period83 4 9 Gross amounts of decreases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period(9)(4)(5)Gross amounts of increases as a result of tax positions taken during the current period7 5 4 Amounts of decreases in unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing authorities(2)(1)(4)Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations(4)(2)(2)Balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year$140 $65 $63 Earnings from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States. The Company participates in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.During the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the Company received notification of the formal conclusion of the compliance process with respect to its fiscal 2023 income tax return under the IRS CAP, which had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2025.Subsequent to June 30, 2025, the IRS completed its examination procedures with respect to fiscal 2024 under the IRS CAP. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to receive formal notification of the conclusion of the IRS CAP process for fiscal 2024 during fiscal 2026. As of June 30, 2025, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal 2025.The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.During fiscal 2025, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending. On the basis of the information available as of June 30, 2025, the Company does not expect significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.F-41Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. As of June 30, 2025, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:Major JurisdictionOpen Fiscal YearsBelgium2019 – 2025Canada2020 – 2025China2022 – 2025France2019 – 2025Germany2017 – 2025Hong Kong2019 – 2025India2013 – 2018, 2020 – 2025 Italy2020 – 2025Japan2020 – 2025Korea2021 – 2025Spain2018 – 2025Switzerland2024 – 2025United Kingdom2024 – 2025United States2024 – 2025State of California2020 – 2025State and City of New York2019 – 2025The Company is also subject to income tax examinations in numerous other state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years subject to examination.NOTE 10 – SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMSUnder its supplier finance programs, the Company agrees to pay the banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the due dates of the invoices.

The 364-Day Facility expires on May 22, 2026. Up to the equivalent of $1,000 million of the 364-Day Facility is available for multi-currency loans. Interest rates on borrowings under the 364-Day Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. The costs incurred to establish the 364-Day Facility were not material. The 364-Day Facility has an annual fee of $0.7 million, payable quarterly, which can fluctuate based on the Company’s current credit ratings each period. The 364-Day Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $175 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. At June 30, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under the 364-Day Facility. In December 2024, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance of its $500 million, 2024 Senior Notes at maturity with cash from operations. In June 2024, the Company replaced its $2,500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in October 2026 with a new $2,500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2024 Facility”). The 2024 Facility expires on June 7, 2029 unless extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement. Up to the equivalent of $750 million of the 2024 Facility is available for multi-currency loans. Interest rates on borrowings under the 2024 Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. The costs incurred to establish the 2024 Facility were not material. In fiscal 2025, the 2024 Facility's annual fee was $1.8 million, payable quarterly, which can fluctuate based on the Company’s credit ratings each period. The 2024 Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $175 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. The 2024 Facility may be increased, at the election of the Company, by up to $500 million in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement. At June 30, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under the 2024 Facility. In February 2024, the Company completed a public offering of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2034 Senior Notes. The Company used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the price to purchase the remaining interest in DECIEM, operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures and redemptions and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings, including outstanding commercial paper as it matured. The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. During fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, there were no amounts outstanding.Refer to Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies for the Company’s projected debt service payments as of June 30, 2025 and over the next five fiscal years.F-46Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 13 – DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial results. At June 30, 2025, the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $3,250 million. Fair Value HedgesThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. At June 30, 2025, the Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $700 million and $300 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three month fallback SOFR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.The Company enters into cross-currency swap contracts to manage the exposure of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. At June 30, 2025, the Company has cross-currency swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $491 million, to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. The cross-currency swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the related intercompany debt, and the gains and losses representing hedge components included in the assessment of effectiveness are presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the excluded components and amounts recognized in (loss) earnings will be recognized in AOCI.The estimated net gain on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as of June 30, 2025 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $14 million. The accumulated net gain (loss) on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in AOCI was $7 million and $(7) million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.Cash Flow HedgesThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies have been designated as cash flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of December 2026. Hedge effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the forward method, which includes forward points in the effectiveness assessment. At June 30, 2025, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $1,517 million.For foreign currency hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to Net sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period Net sales. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective.The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.F-47Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe estimated net loss on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2025 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $29 million. The accumulated net (loss) gain on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in AOCI was $(13) million and $75 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.Net Investment HedgesThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. Forward points and cross-currency basis spreads, respectively, are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company’s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of November 2029. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At June 30, 2025, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with notional amounts totaling $1,055 million.Credit RiskAs a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $82 million at June 30, 2025. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.The fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:Asset DerivativesLiability DerivativesFair Value (1)Fair Value (1)June 30June 30(In millions)Balance SheetLocation20252024Balance SheetLocation20252024Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign currency forward contracts(2)Prepaid expenses and other current assets; Other assets$7 $49 Other accrued liabilities$82 $4 Cross-currency swap contracts(3)Prepaid expenses and other current assets; Other assets50 80 Other accrued liabilities15 — Interest rate contracts— — Other accrued liabilities104 145 Total Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments57 129 201 149 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign currency forward contractsPrepaid expenses and other current assets25 19 Other accrued liabilities15 17 Total derivatives$82 $148 $216 $166 (1)See Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements for further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.(2)Included in the asset derivatives for the foreign currency forward contracts at June 30, 2024 is $2 million, classified within Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using SOFR forward curves.Cross-currency swap contracts – The fair values of the Company’s cross-currency swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.Interest rate contracts – The fair values of the Company’s interest rate contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and SOFR forward curves, were obtained from independent pricing services.Current and long-term debt – The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, debt also includes finance lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value. The Company’s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.Deferred consideration payable – The deferred consideration payable consists primarily of deferred payments associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition. The fair value of the payments treated as deferred consideration payable are calculated based on the net present value of cash payments using an estimated borrowing rate based on quoted prices for a similar liability. The Company’s deferred consideration payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 5 – Asset Acquisition for additional information associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition.Nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisIn connection with its interim and annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and the Dr.Jart+ other intangible asset impairment, the Company has measured certain nonfinancial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company also maintains post-retirement benefit plans that provide certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For contributions, the Company seeks to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.Restoration Plan (U.S.)The Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.International Pension PlansThe Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans. The Company’s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations. The Company’s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.Post-retirement Benefit PlansThe Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire. Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan. Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree. It is the Company’s practice to fund a portion of these benefits as incurred and may provide discretionary funding for future liabilities up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.Certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.F-57Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE

INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds. The discount rate for the Company’s domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company’s domestic plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in that respective country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan. In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.The weighted-average interest crediting rate used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost relating to the Company’s U.S. Pension Plans was 4.24% and 5.20% as of and for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is 8.06% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of 4.02% is expected to be reached in approximately 15 years to 25 years. Amounts recognized in AOCI (before tax) as of June 30, 2025 are as

diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan’s investment policy. The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.The Company’s target asset allocation at June 30, 2025 is as follows:Pension PlansU.S.InternationalEquity39 %20 %Debt securities50 %56 %Other11 %24 %100 %100 %F-61Table of ContentsTHE

equivalents – Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds. These assets are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.F-62Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSShort-term investment funds – The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. For some assets the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.Government and agency securities – The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Commingled funds – The fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. When the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 10 to 14 days. There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments.Insurance contracts – The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.Interests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments – The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly and quarterly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 30 to 90 days. Unfunded commitments related to these investments are de minimis.401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)The Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular full-time U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by the plan document. Regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan thirty days following their date of hire. The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after one year of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s contribution level. The Company’s contributions were $51 million, $51 million and $50 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.Deferred CompensationThe Company has agreements with certain employees and outside directors who defer compensation. The Company accrues for such compensation, and either interest thereon or for the change in the value of cash units. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $41 million and $44 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The benefit for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $3 million, $14 million and $7 million,

Refer to Note 7 – Leases for information regarding future minimum lease payments relating to the Company’s finance leases. Interest costs on long-term and current debt in fiscal 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030 and thereafter are projected to be $290 million, $289 million, $274 million, $243 million, $233 million and $2,276 million, respectively. Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2025.(2)Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include: inventory commitments, information technology contract commitments, accrued restructuring, deferred consideration payable, advertising commitments and royalty payments pursuant to license agreements. Future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2025, without consideration for potential renewal periods.(3)Refer to Note 9 – Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. As of June 30, 2025, the noncurrent portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, was $157 million. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.(4)The Transition Tax may be paid over an eight-year period and this amount represents the remaining liability as of June 30, 2025.(5)Refer to Note 7 – Leases for information regarding future minimum lease payments relating to the Company’s operating leases.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims), advertising, regulatory, employment, intellectual property, real estate, environmental, trade relations, securities, tax, and privacy. The Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, and it is able to determine such estimates. Legal defense costs are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.Refer below for the assessment of loss contingencies associated with the Company's Securities Class Action and Derivative Matters and Cosmetic Talcum Powder Matters.Management believes that the outcome of all remaining current litigation and other legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for the Company's remaining litigation and legal proceedings are not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, management’s assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the Securities Class Action and Derivative Matters and Cosmetic Talcum Powder Matters, could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings. F-64Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSecurities Class Action and Derivative MattersOn December 7, 2023 and January 22, 2024, the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were named as defendants in separate purported securities class action complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On February 20, 2024, those two purported securities class actions were consolidated into one action. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended class action complaint, which alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements during the period February 3, 2022 to October 31, 2023 in press releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with analysts that artificially inflated the price of the Company’s stock in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On March 31, 2025, the Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants intend to defend the action vigorously. On February 1, 2024 and March 15, 2024, stockholder derivative action complaints were filed against certain of the Company’s officers as of those dates, all the Company’s directors as of those dates and certain of the Company’s former directors as of those dates in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2024, both complaints were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Subsequently, the Company's Board of Directors ("the Board") received stockholder litigation demands, requesting, among other things, that the Board investigate potential claims on behalf of the Company based on the same alleged course of conduct identified in the securities case complaint (which were also the subject of the voluntarily dismissed stockholder derivative actions complaints) described above. A committee of the Board has been formed to review the stockholder demands and make recommendations, as appropriate in its discretion, to the Board.On May 8, 2025, two additional stockholder derivative action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company’s officers and directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment from the sale of stock by certain individual defendants during the time period surrounding the allegations of false and misleading statements in the purported securities class action described above. Then, on June 23, 2025, another stockholder derivative action complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Kings County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors, also alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment as well as claims of waste, gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, and insider trading.The Company believes that it is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these matters or to estimate the loss or range of losses, if any, as the matters are in their early stages.Cosmetic Talcum Powder MattersThe Company has been named as a defendant in civil actions alleging that certain cosmetic talcum powder products sold by the Company were contaminated with asbestos. Most of these actions involve a number of co-defendants from a variety of different industries. As of June 30, 2025, there were 84 individual cases pending against the Company in state and federal courts throughout the United States, as compared to 273 cases as of June 30, 2024. During the year ended June 30, 2025, 76 new cases were filed and 265 cases were resolved by settlement or voluntary dismissal (including pursuant to the cases that were settled in the talcum litigation settlement agreements described below).In view of the number of cases pending against the Company at June 30, 2024 as well as the evolution of the litigation landscape and expectations regarding future claims at that time, the Company took action from the end of August 2024 through October 2024 to mitigate its future exposure. During the period, the Company reached agreements with certain plaintiff law firms (collectively, the “talcum litigation settlement agreements”) for: (i) the resolution of over 200 pending cosmetic talcum powder matters handled by those firms as well as (ii) a process for resolving potential future cosmetic talcum powder claims expected to be brought on behalf of plaintiffs by those firms from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029, with annual capped amounts per year for each participating law firm. To account for the talcum litigation settlement agreements, the Company recorded a charge of $159 million during the fiscal 2025 first quarter for the amount agreed to settle the current and potential future claims (amounts recorded for potential future claims is based on the best estimate of the probable loss and a reasonably possible loss beyond the amounts recorded is not expected to be material). As of June 30, 2025, $22 million is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $85 million is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet related to the talcum litigation settlement agreements.F-65Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThere are and could be other plaintiff law firms outside of those included in the talcum litigation settlement agreements that bring claims against the Company. The value of other settlements outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, either individually or in the aggregate, for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were not material. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of all individual cases pending against the Company or potential unasserted claims, and therefore a specific estimate and associated provision is made, as needed, for a small number of individual cases that have advanced to the later stages of legal proceedings. For the remaining filed cases, the Company records an estimate of exposure loss on an aggregated and ongoing basis, which takes into account the historical outcomes of cases the Company has resolved to date. Any adverse outcomes, either in an individual case or in the aggregate, could be material. While the Company and its legal counsel intend to continue to defend these cases vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. The amounts recorded during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 for such litigation, outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities currently cannot be reasonably estimated for cosmetic talcum matters. The Company believes that a portion of its costs incurred in defending and resolving these claims may be covered by insurance policies issued by several insurance carriers, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions and policy limits. Amounts received to date have not been material.NOTE 18 – COMMON STOCKAs of June 30, 2025, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of 1,300 million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, and 304 million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of one share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock converted. Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share.Information about the Company’s common stock outstanding is as follows:(Shares in thousands)Class AClass BBalance at June 30, 2022231,513.5 125,542.0 Acquisition of treasury stock(1)(1,220.7)— Stock-based compensation1,785.1 — Balance at June 30, 2023232,077.9 125,542.0 Acquisition of treasury stock(1)(316.5)— Stock-based compensation1,385.2 — Balance at June 30, 2024233,146.6 125,542.0 Acquisition of treasury stock(1)(482.5)— Stock-based compensation1,560.7 — Balance at June 30, 2025234,224.8 125,542.0 (1)In fiscal 2023, this amount represents shares repurchased under our authorized share repurchase program, as well as shares repurchased to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the payout of certain stock-based compensation arrangements.

These Plans currently provide for the issuance of approximately 100.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock, which consist of shares cumulatively provided for and shares transferred to the Fiscal 2002 Plan from other inactive plans and employment agreements, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors of the Company. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 15.3 million shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted pursuant to these Plans. The Company may satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new or treasury shares. The Company’s equity compensation awards include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”), long-term PSUs, including long-term price-vested units (“PVUs”), and share units. Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, long-term PSUs and share units. Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows:Year Ended June 30,(In millions)202520242023Compensation expense(1)$304 $325 $267 Income tax benefit$58 $58 $52 (1)Excludes compensation expense relating to liability-classified awards, including DECIEM stock options discussed below.As of June 30, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards was $181 million and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately one year.F-67Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSStock OptionsThe following is a summary of the status of the Company’s stock options as of June 30, 2025 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:(Shares in thousands)SharesWeighted-AverageExercisePrice Per ShareAggregateIntrinsicValue(1)(in millions)Weighted-AverageContractual LifeRemaining in YearsOutstanding at June 30, 20248,495.7 $182.95 Granted at fair value885.2 90.93 Exercised(207.2)76.47 Expired(308.3)220.20 Forfeited(178.9)162.77 Outstanding at June 30, 20258,686.5 175.21 $3 5.0Vested and expected to vest at June 30, 20258,653.2 175.33 $3 5.0Exercisable at June 30, 20256,761.9 183.72 $2 4.0(1)The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Stock option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches over a service period of up to four years. The Company attributes the value of option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.The following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:Year Ended June 30,(In millions, except per share data)202520242023Per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted$29.24 $52.83 $79.09 Intrinsic value of stock options exercised$3 $31 $93 The fair value of each of the Company's option grants were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Year Ended June 30, 202520242023Weighted-average expected stock-price volatility37.5%33.8%30.8%Weighted-average expected option life6 years6 years6 yearsAverage risk-free interest rate3.6%4.3%3.4%Average dividend yield2.4%1.5%0.8%The Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock. The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources. For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.

On September 3, 2024, since the Company achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, and since the executive completed the requisite service, the Company issued 195,940 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock to its then Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the terms of these PSUs. At the time of issuance, the total fair value of shares granted was $18 million.In March 2021, the Company granted to the Company’s then CEO PSUs with an aggregate payout of 68,578 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, to incentivize him to continue serving through at least June 30, 2024. Generally, no portion of this award will vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the performance share unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as any delivery of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The aggregate grant date fair value of the PSUs of approximately $20 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Since the Company achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, and since the then CEO completed the requisite service, 68,578 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, and the related dividends to be paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant on September 2, 2025.Long-term Price-Vested Units In March 2021, the Company granted to the Company’s then CEO PVUs with an aggregate payout of 85,927 shares, divided into three tranches, of the Company's Class A Common Stock, to incentivize him to continue serving through at least June 30, 2024. Generally, no portion of this award will vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the price-vested unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. In addition, the vesting of each tranche is contingent upon the Company’s achievement of the respective stock price goal, which means that the average closing price per share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange be at or above the applicable stock price goal (noted in the table below) for 20 consecutive trading days during the applicable performance period.

available that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”). As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the CEO. While the Company’s results of operations are reviewed on a consolidated basis, the CEO also reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics. Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, the CEO evaluates performance based on its four major product categories: skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care. These product categories meet the definition of operating and reportable segments and, accordingly, additional financial data is provided below. Skin care products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, eye care, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil corrections, facial masks and sun care products. Makeup products include foundations, powders, concealers, and setting sprays, lipsticks, lip liners and lip glosses, and mascaras, eyeshadows and eye liners. Fragrance products include parfum, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, eau de cologne and body spray, as well as lotions, creams, powders, candles and soaps that are based on a particular fragrance. Hair care products include shampoos, conditioners, styling products, treatment, finishing sprays and hair color products. Royalty revenue associated with the license of the TOM FORD trademark as discussed in Note 15 - Revenue Recognition, as well as sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit within the Company's definitions of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care are included in the other category. The CEO assesses each reportable segment’s performance using their respective operating income. Segment operating income is used in developing the overall strategy and during the annual budget process, as well as considered in budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each reportable segment. Segment net sales and operating income is before the impacts of restructuring and other activities and the impacts from the other category described above. Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's segments because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of segment performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. The accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with the exception that the impacts of restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the reportable segments. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the CEO or included herein.F-75Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSInformation about the Company's four operating segments is as follows:(in millions)June 30, 2025Skin CareMakeupFragranceHair CareTotalNet sales$14,326 Less: Other category net sales100 Less: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities3 Segment net sales$6,962 $4,205 $2,491 $565 $14,223 Cost of sales1,817 1,131 571 158 3,677 Selling, general and administrative expenses4,196 3,048 1,749 448 9,441 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets375 308 549 — 1,232 Other segment items(1)— 159 — — 159 Segment operating income (loss)$574 $(441)$(378)$(41)$(286)Other category operating loss(13)Charges associated with restructuring and other activities(486)Operating loss(785)Reconciliation to loss before income taxes:Interest expense(357)Interest income and investment income, net114 Other components of net periodic benefit cost(12)Loss before income taxes$(1,040)Segment depreciation and amortization$403 $243 $144 $33 $823 Other category6 Depreciation and amortization$829 (1) Other segment items include Talcum litigation settlement agreementsF-76Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(in millions)June 30, 2024Skin CareMakeupFragranceHair CareTotalNet sales$15,608 Less: Other category net sales115 Less: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities(1)Segment net sales$7,908 $4,470 $2,487 $629 $15,494 Cost of sales2,278 1,290 624 191 4,383 Selling, general and administrative expenses4,424 3,087 1,598 490 9,599 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets471 — — — 471 Segment operating income (loss)$735 $93 $265 $(52)$1,041 Other category operating income53 Charges associated with restructuring and other activities(124)Operating income970Reconciliation to earnings before income taxes:Interest expense(378)Interest income and investment income, net167 Other components of net periodic benefit cost13 Earnings before income taxes$772 Segment depreciation and amortization$418 $236 $132 $33 $819 Other category6 Depreciation and amortization$825 F-77Table of ContentsTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(in millions)June 30, 2023Skin CareMakeupFragranceHair CareTotalNet sales$15,910 Less: Other category net sales53 Less: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities(27)Segment net sales$8,249 $4,532 $2,451 $652 $15,884 Cost of sales2,397 1,319 617 188 4,521 Selling, general and administrative expenses4,475 3,127 1,464 500 9,566 Impairment of other intangible assets100 107 — — 207 Segment operating income (loss)$1,277 $(21)$370 $(36)$1,590 Other category operating income4 Charges associated with restructuring and other activities(85)Operating income1,509Reconciliation to earnings before income taxes:Interest expense(255)Interest income and investment income, net131 Other components of net periodic benefit cost12 Earnings before income taxes$1,397 Segment depreciation and amortization$383 $211 $117 $31 $742 Other category2 Depreciation and amortization$744 For the Company’s geographic region presentation, as disclosed in Note 15 – Revenue Recognition, net sales are attributed to a country based on the legal entity sale location, and this predominantly aligns with the location of the customer, with the primary exception related to the Company’s net sales from the travel retail business. The net sales from the Company’s global travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa geographic region, with the exception of net sales of Dr.Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific geographic region. For the presentation of net sales by country below, the Company has presented this based on the location of the customer (e.g., the customer is the retailer in the wholesale business and the consumer in the direct-to-consumer business), and as such has attributed net sales from the travel retail business to the country to which the product is shipped, and not the Company’s country of legal sale. The Company is domiciled in the United States. Net sales in the United States, including net sales from travel retail locations in the United States, as well as net sales in foreign countries, including net sales from travel retail locations in that country, that contribute 10% or more of net sales of the Company in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:June 30,(in millions)202520242023United States$3,762 $3,887 $3,848 Mainland China3,652 4,019 4,380 Korea(1)718 1,299 1,558 All other countries6,194 6,403 6,124 Net sales$14,326 $15,608 $15,910 (1)Korea contributed 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023.
