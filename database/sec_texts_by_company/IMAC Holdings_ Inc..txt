Explanatory
Note
This
Amendment No1. (the “Amendment”) to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, originally
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 15, 2025 (the “Original Filing”) by
IMAC Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is being filed to amend and restate the Original Filing in its entirety. Amendments
were made to Part II, Item 8, Part II, Item 9A, and Part III, Item 10. Changes were not made to the remaining
sections, but all other sections are contained in this Amendment for convenience.
Restatement
Background
As
previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 20, 2025, the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company (the “Audit Committee”), based on the recommendation
of management, determined that the Company’s previously issued financial statements included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 should no longer be relied upon and require restatement because of an
error with respect to the accounting for its preferred dividends.
Refer to Note 2 – Restatement of Previously
Issued Financial Statements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Restatement,
including the impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Items Amended in this Filing
This Form 10-K/A amends and restates the following
item included in the Original Form 10-K as appropriate to reflect the Restatement:
●Part II, Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
●Part
II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
●Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executives Officers
and Corporate Governance
The Company is including with this Form 10-K/A
currently dated certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as required by Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Mr.
Jeffrey Busch resigned from the Board of Directors effective May 31, 2025. On June 2, 2025, the Company appointed Jason Lobel and Saundra
Pelletier as members of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Except as discussed above and as further described
in Note 2 to the Financial Statements in this Form 10-K/A, the Company has not modified or updated the disclosures presented in the Original
Form 10-K to reflect events that occurred at a later date or facts that subsequently became known to the Company. Accordingly, forward-looking
statements included in this Amendment No. 1 may represent management’s view as of the Original Form 10-K and should not be assumed
to be accurate as of any date thereafter. Accordingly, this Form 10-K/A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s filings
with the SEC subsequent to the date on which it filed the Original Form 10-K with the SEC. The check marks on the cover page of this
Form 10-K/A reflect the Company’s filer status as of the date on which it filed the Original Form 10-K.

ITEM
1.
BUSINESS
Overview
We
provide services related to proteomic products that identify and support oncology clinical treatment decisions and biopharmaceutical
drug development.
Until
recently, we were a holding company for IMAC Regeneration Centers, The BackSpace retail stores and our Investigational New Drug division,
providing movement and orthopedic therapies and minimally invasive procedures to improve the physical health of patients at locations
we owned or managed. As of December 31, 2023, we sold or discontinued patient care at all our locations.
In
May 2024, we acquired certain assets and rights of Theralink Technologies, Inc. (“Theralink”), consisting primarily of a
nationally CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited and New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (“NYS-CLEP”) certified
laboratory in Golden, Colorado and equipment located in the lab. Theralink was in the process of developing technology to monetize a
license from Vanderbilt University (“Vanderbilt”), which provided a predictor of response to immunotherapy in cancer, and
a license for business in the United States from George Mason University (“GMU”), which included intellectual property around
improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures that form the basis for future proteomics products (collectively, the
“Original Proteomics Licenses”). We have also entered into agreements with Vanderbilt and GMU to transfer the Original Proteomics
Licenses.
On
May 30, 2024, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Ignite Proteomics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Ignite”),
to operate the medical lab acquired from Theralink, deliver services related to proteomic products under the licenses from GMU and Vanderbilt
and collect fees for services rendered. We are using the acquired assets under our own branding, the Ignite name. Ignite has obtained
credentials to bill Medicare for reimbursement for our Ignite proteomics test and is in the process of obtaining credentials for reimbursement
by certain other third-party payors. We also accept payment from private insurers.
Intellectual Property
The
Vanderbilt License
Under
the license between Vanderbilt and Theralink, dated March 14, 2023, as amended from time to time, and assigned to us on May 15, 2024
pursuant to that certain Assignment and Assumption of License and Consent of Licensor between Theralink, IMAC and Vanderbilt (the “Vanderbilt
License”), Vanderbilt granted us an exclusive license, in all fields of use, under the patents described in the Vanderbilt License
(the “Vanderbilt Patents”) to make, use, offer to sell, sell and import products, processes and services that are covered
by the Vanderbilt Patents (the “Vanderbilt Licensed Products”) during the term of the Vanderbilt License. The term of the
Vanderbilt License shall continue until the expiration of the Vanderbilt Patents, unless sooner terminated by Vanderbilt or us in accordance
with the terms of the Vanderbilt License.
As
consideration for the Vanderbilt License, we agreed to pay Vanderbilt (1) an annual, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee, (2)
a royalty percentage of gross sales of Vanderbilt Licensed Products ranging from 0.25% of gross sales for Vanderbilt Licensed Products
that incorporate ten or more additional non-commodity constituent parts to 2% of gross sales for Vanderbilt Licensed Products that incorporate
zero additional non-commodity constituent parts, and (3) for any improvement patents of Vanderbilt which we elect to use under the Vanderbilt
License.
Vanderbilt
has exclusive responsibility for prosecution of the Vanderbilt Patents, including choice of patent counsel.
1
The
GMU License
Under
the License Agreement between George Mason Intellectual Properties (“GMIP”) and Theranostics Health, LLC and its successors
dated September 15, 2006, as amended from time to time, and assigned to the Company on May 23, 2024 pursuant to that certain Assignment
and Assumption of License and Consent of Licensor between Theralink, us and GMIP (the “GMU License”), GMIP granted us an
exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license, under the patents described in the GMU License (the “GMU Patents”), to make,
have made, import, use, market, offer for sale and sell products designed, manufactured, used and/or marketed for use in all fields and
for all uses during the term of the GMU License (the “GMU Licensed Products”). The term of the GMU License continues until
the expiration of the GMU Patents, unless sooner terminated by GMIP or us in accordance with the terms of the GMU License. The exclusivity
of the GMU License is conditioned on our agreement to manufacture GMU Licensed Products substantially in the United States unless we
obtain a waiver of this requirement from an appropriate U.S. governmental authority.
Additionally,
under the GMU License, GMIP granted to us an exclusive option (the “Exclusive Option”) to GMIP’s or George Mason University’s
interest in any information, inventions, procedures, methods, devices, discoveries, technologies, data, designs or concepts related to
the field of theranostics from certain inventors as described in the GMU License.
As
consideration for the GMU License, we agreed to pay GMIP (1) an annual fee for the Exclusive Option, (2) quarterly royalties equal to
the net revenue obtained by us and our affiliates from the sale of the GMU Licensed Products multiplied by one and one-half percent (1.5%),
(3) quarterly sublicensing royalties equal to the sublicensing revenue obtained by us and our affiliates in connection with the GMU License
multiplied by fifteen percent (15%), and (4) a payment for each patent issued relating to GMU Patents.
We
have the right to control all aspects of filing, prosecuting, and maintaining the GMU Patents at our sole discretion. During the term
of the GMU License, we have the first option to police the GMU Patents and the GMU Licensed Products against infringements by other parties
worldwide within the designated field of use.
Strategy
Ignite Proteomics
expects to generate revenue from clinical diagnostic testing, research contracts with leading academic and biopharmaceutical clients,
participation in clinical trials and registries, and partnerships aimed at accelerating the development of novel targeted therapies.
While breast cancer remains the immediate area of focus, the Company anticipates expanding to other tumor types and adding additional
biomarkers with broad potential applications. High gross margins projected from the RPPA-based tests mean the Company can achieve profitability
with a relatively modest share of the breast cancer diagnostics market. Beyond its internal clinical portfolio, Ignite’s lab services
and intellectual property enable valuable partnerships in preclinical drug discovery and other technology collaborations.
The Company’s
management believes ongoing clinical data, guideline endorsements, and expanded research collaborations will position Ignite as a premier
resource for next-generation proteomic diagnostics in oncology.
Although we have patent coverage
in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States for certain biomarkers related to Ignite’s assay, we do not currently offer
or sell our products outside of the United Stares. Our immediate priority is to establish adoption within the United States. We plan
to further explore international opportunities once we have sufficient funding and operational resources to implement our expansion strategy
abroad.

Product
Portfolio
Our
product is a unique and patented RPPA technology platform, which can quantify protein signaling to support oncology clinical treatment
decisions and biopharmaceutical drug development. Because protein signaling is responsible for the development and progression of cancer,
nearly all FDA-approved cancer therapeutics target proteins, not genes. The Ignite RPPA technology can reveal the protein drug target(s)
that are essentially turned “on” in a patient’s cancer and may help support the most effective treatment plan to turn
those proteins “off”. Therefore, the Ignite RPPA technology is a critical tool that may empower oncologists with actionable
information to effectively treat a cancer patient, which is often missed by standard proteomic and genomic testing. Our commercially
available Lab Developed Test (LDT), the Ignite RPPA Assay for Breast Cancer, is currently being utilized by oncologists across the United
States to assist in making the most targeted treatment plan for their patients with advanced breast cancer. The Ignite Proteomics test
determines which drug target(s) are present and/or activated and may reveal to the oncologist which patients are predicted to be responders
versus non-responders to a particular therapeutic. The test may provide therapeutic recommendations to support oncologist treatment selection
of the best therapy option – which may improve patient response and consequently save the healthcare system substantial dollars.
In
molecular diagnostic testing, it is common for assays to include dozens or even hundreds of potential markers, even though only a smaller
subset has the robust evidence to warrant major cancer care guideline inclusion, for instance, the guidelines of the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN), and commercial and government payer reimbursement. Our Ignite RPPA tests for 32 analyte, which are proteins or
“activated” proteins. Although we currently measure 32 protein markers in a single test we are pursuing formal insurance
coverage and guideline inclusion, including from NCCN, on a marker-by-marker basis, focusing first on those that demonstrate clear clinical
utility.
We
believe our RPPA analysis of phosphorylated AKT for AKT-targeted drugs, two-marker combinations for HER2 therapy response, and MHC-II
for pembrolizumab meet the standards for NCCN guideline inclusion as emerging biomarkers based on the following clinical data:
●
phosphorylated
AKT, which is shown to be a predictor of response to the drug ipatasertib independent of the traditional biomarkers. The findings
are clinically significant (95% confidence level of 4%-67% improvement over standard of care), even though the sample size is small.
The study is published at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377742/.
3
●
Plotting
pEGFR and pERBB2 expression together revealed a separation into two groups of patients: one with excellent response to the target
therapy, neratinib, and one without. Since HER2 and EGFR are well-known heterodimerization partners, the fact that both are found
to be highly co-activated in the pre-treatment tumor samples of responding patient population provide further evidence of functional
HER2-driven pathway activation and signaling coherence. The study is published at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8571284/.
●
MHC-II
has been shown to be a superior biomarker to PDL-1 for predicting response to pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The data we will present
to NCCN is currently in review for publication. However, there are other studies that support our findings, including at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4740184/
for melanoma patients. Our data will be the first analysis in breast cancer patients to be published.
The
currently available Ignite RPPA Assay for Breast Cancer will be followed by the Ignite RPPA Pan-Tumor Assay 1.0, expected to launch in
2025 to include ovarian, endometrial, and head & neck cancers. The test is expected to expand further in 2026 to the Ignite RPPA
Pan-Tumor Assay 2.0 to support the treatment of colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, and other solid tumor cancer indications. We
are aware that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) published new rules concerning LDT regulation on May 6,
2024, and intend to comply fully with the final regulations. Because we have demonstrated analytic and clinical validity under CLIA,
CAP, and NYS CLEP standards, we anticipate meeting any additional FDA requirements as they come into effect. However, we cannot guarantee
that we will meet any such new requirements or be able to obtain any new approvals required.
Corporate
Information
The Company was organized
in August 2000 as a Kentucky professional service corporation and was the forerunner to our business through 2023. In March 2015, IMAC
Holdings, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company was organized and effective June 1, 2018, IMAC Holdings, LLC converted into a Delaware
corporation and changed its name to IMAC Holdings, Inc., which conversion is referred to herein as the Corporate Conversion. In conjunction
with the conversion, all of our outstanding membership interests were exchanged on a proportional basis into shares of common stock.
Our principal executive offices
are located at 3401 Mallory Lane, Suite 100, Franklin, Tennessee, 37067 and our telephone number is (303) 898-5896. We maintain a corporate
website at imacholdings.com.
During the year ended December
31, 2024, the Company entered into several financing transactions with Theralink Technologies, Inc. that culminated in an acquisition
of Theralink assets. Pursuant to the Settlement and Release Agreement, the Company acquired certain assets which resulted in the recording
of long lived assets of $1.1 million. The Note receivables of $1.1 million was settled as part of the arrangement. In addition, in order
to receive releases from security holders of Theralink, the Company issued 24,172 shares of Series E preferred stock. The Series E preferred
stock was valued at a de minimis value. Series E preferred stock does not have any voting rights and each preferred share has a conversion
price of $3.641 per share.
We
subsequently obtained transfers to us of the Original Proteomics Licenses.
Listing of Company Securities
Beginning in 2023, the Company
experienced deficiencies in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. Including the Minimum Equity Rule, which required us to maintain a
required minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued listing, as required under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). We cured
all such deficiencies subject ot a one year “Panel Monitor” as that term is defined by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B)
with respect to the Minimum Equity Rule.
4
On
January 21, 2025, the Company received a Notice from Nasdaq advising the Company that it no longer complied with the Minimum Equity Rule.
Due to the Panel Monitor, the Company was not eligible to submit a plan to the Staff to request an extension of up to 180 calendar days
in which to regain compliance with the Minimum Equity Rule, and as a result, the Staff determined to delist the Company’s securities
from Nasdaq.
The
Company appealed the delisting notice at a hearing before Nasdaq on March 4, 2025. On March 24, 2025, the Company was notified by Nasdaq
that our appeal was denied and that the Company’s securities were suspended at the open of trading on March 26, 2025. We expect
Nasdaq to complete the delisting by filing a Notification of Removal from Listing on Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”).
As a result of the suspension in trading and expected
delisting, the Company’s common stock began trading publicly on the OTC Pink Market under its existing symbols “BACK”
on March 26, 2025. The Company intends to apply to have its common stock traded on the OTCQB. There is no guarantee that such application
will be approved or when.
Implications
of Being a Smaller Reporting Company
We
are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We may take advantage
of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures
for so long as (i) the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured
on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured
on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the
two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and have reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation, and, as long as we are a smaller reporting company with less than $100 million in annual revenue, we
are not required to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public
accounting firm.
Government
Regulation
Laboratory Developed
Test Regulations
In
general, the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and equivalent other country authorities require labeling, advertising
and promotional materials to be truthful and not misleading and marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the
provisions of the approved label.
5
We intend to develop diagnostic
tests, a laboratory developed test (“LDT”) for clients that cannot currently be provided using test kits approved or cleared
by the FDA. The FDA has been considering changes to the way that it regulates these LDTs. Currently, all LDTs are conducted and offered
in accordance with CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures.
The FDA has published a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified
approach for some lower risk LDTs that may require FDA oversight short of the full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress
may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDA’s role with regard to LDTs.
In
2014, the FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining
the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. The FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to
finalize its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017,
the FDA published a non-binding “Discussion Paper” proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft
guidance, “to spur further dialogue” and give “congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative
solution.” Recent agency announcements made in the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy
landscape and further uncertainty regarding the FDA’s role in regulating LDTs. In August 2020, the Department of Health and Human
Services (“HHS”) announced that the FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking,
but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to the FDA’s longstanding
approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.
Congress
has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including,
among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both
the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act
of 2021 (“VITAL Act”), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will
enact legislation regulating LDTs, and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in the FDA’s
2014 draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts.
Environmental Regulation
Our
operations produce hazardous waste products, including chemicals, radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Although we believe
that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials complies with the standards prescribed by state and federal
laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract
with third parties for the disposal of such hazardous waste products. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Additionally, we must comply
with the regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other regulatory statutes,
and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. OSHA and/or the EPA may promulgate regulations that may
affect our research and development programs.
6
Employees
and Human Capital Management
As
of March 31, 2025, we employed 15 individuals, of which all were full-time employees. As of that date, none of our employees were governed
by collective bargaining agreements or were members of a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We remain further
committed to increasing the diversity of our employee base.
Available

ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS
In
addition to the information set forth at the beginning of this Form 10-K entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” you should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving
our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely
affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. These
risk factors may not identify all risks that we face and our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known
to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.
Risks
Relating to Our Business
We
recorded a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and there can be no assurance that our future operations
will result in net income; we received a going concern qualification.
For
the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had net loss from our current business of approximately $6,298,000 and $0,
respectively. There can be no assurance that our future operations will result in net income. Our failure to increase our revenues or
improve our gross margins will harm our business. We may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis
in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, our gross margins fail to improve or our operating expenses exceed
our expectations, our operating results will suffer. The fee we charge for our management services may decrease, which would reduce our
revenues and harm our business. If we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs, or if we fail to develop
and introduce new services on a timely basis and services from which we can derive additional revenues, our financial results will suffer.
As
discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from, and net cash used in, operations
and has a net capital deficiency, and has discontinued its operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. We expect to incur losses this year and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Our future success depends on our
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and changes in management may negatively affect our business. We have a need for additional
funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our development. We may form
or seek strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
financing to fund our operations, we may have to seek protection under applicable law, which may include Federal or state bankruptcy
laws.
7
Further,
because of our small size and limited operating history, our company is particularly susceptible to adverse effects from changes in the
law, economic conditions, consumer tastes, competition and other contingencies or events beyond our control. It may be more difficult
for us to prepare for and respond to these types of risks than it would be for a company with an established business and operating cash
flow. Due to changing circumstances or an inability to implement any portion of our growth strategy, we may be forced to dramatically
change our planned operations.
If
we are unable to successfully integrate the assets we purchased from Theralink, our financial results could be adversely affected.
On
May 1, 2024, we acquired certain assets of Theralink. The Company is still in the process of integrating such assets into its control
and business. On May 30, 2024, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ignite, to operate a medical lab, deliver services related to the
assets we acquired from Theralink and collect fees for services rendered. Ignite is in the process of obtaining credentials for reimbursement
for our Ignite test by Medicare and certain third-party payors. Until such time as Ignite is credentialed, we will accept payment from
private insurers. Our Board has also approved the creation of the Ignite Compassionate Care program to enable those without private insurance
or private funds to access our Ignite test when needed until we are credentialed and thereafter for those without access to any form
of insurance. Any failure of the Company to obtain additional license agreement assignments, obtain credentials for reimbursement by
Medicare and certain other third party providers or otherwise integrate the acquired assets limit our ability to generate or increase
revenue and could adversely affect our financial results. We will need additional funding to achieve our goals and may be unable to raise
additional capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development and commercialization efforts.
Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights
to our technologies.
We
expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the development and commercialization of our technology.
We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until such time as we can generate substantial service
revenues, we may attempt to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, government and/or other third-party grants
or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our investors’ ownership
interest will be diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability
to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to
obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more research or development programs, which would
adversely impact potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be certain that additional funding will
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or
eliminate one or more of our research and development activities.
We
may fail completely to implement key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, which could adversely affect our operations and financial
performance.
On
May 30, 2024, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Ignite, to operate a medical lab, deliver services related to the assets we acquired
from Theralink and collect fees for services rendered. Ignite is in the process of obtaining credentials for reimbursement for our Ignite
test by Medicare and certain third-party payors. Until such time as Ignite is credentialed, we will accept payment from private insurers.
Our Board has also approved the creation of the Ignite Compassionate Care program to enable those without private insurance or private
funds to access our Ignite test when needed until we are credentialed and thereafter for those without access to any form of insurance.
8
If
we cannot implement one or more key elements of our growth and expansion strategy, including raising sufficient capital, hiring and retaining
qualified staff, leasing and developing acceptable premises for our medical clinics, securing necessary service contracts on favorable
or adequate terms, generating sufficient revenue and achieving numerous other objectives, our projected financial performance may be
materially adversely affected. Even if all of the key elements of our growth and expansion strategy are successfully implemented, we
may not achieve the favorable results, operations and financial performance that we anticipate.
If
we fail to achieve and sustain commercial success for our services, our business will suffer, our future prospects may be harmed, and
our stock price would likely decline.
Prior
to our acquisition of assets from Theralink, Theralink sold or marketed its product on a very limited basis. Unless we can continue to
successfully commercialize our services or acquire the right to market other approved products or services, our business will be materially
adversely affected. Our ability to generate revenues for our services will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, including
the following:
●
acceptance of and ongoing satisfaction of our services by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors in
the United States, and eventually in foreign markets if we receive marketing approvals abroad;
●
our ability to develop and expand market share for analyzing late-stage cancer patients, both in the United States and potentially in
the rest of the world if we receive marketing approvals outside of the United States, in the midst of numerous competing technologies
for late-stage cancer, many of which are already generally accepted in the medical community;
●
adequate coverage or reimbursement for our services by government healthcare programs and third-party payors, including private health
coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations; and
●
the ability of patients to afford any required co-payments for our services
Our
competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or reach the market sooner, which may diminish
or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize.
Competition
in the cancer information field is intense and accentuated by the rapid pace of advancements in product development. Further, research
and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render potential technologies obsolete before they generate revenue.
Some
of our competitors in the cancer predictive biomarker space have substantially greater research and development capabilities than we
do. Their processing, marketing, financial and managerial resources may be greater than ours. Acquisitions of competing companies by
large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors’ resources. In addition, our competitors may obtain
patent protection or FDA approval and commercialize predictive biomarkers more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of our
technology. We expect that competition among technology options will be based, among other things, on price, safety, reliability, availability,
patent protection, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our technology
cannot compete effectively in the marketplace.

Many
universities and private and public research institutes may in the future become active in cancer research, which may be in direct competition
with us.

We
may face competition in Europe from other technologies and products, and we expect we may face competition from those technologies and
products in the future in the United States as well. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors
are able to obtain broader marketing approval for predictive biomarkers, our technology will become subject to increased competition.
Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding
the validity and/or scope of our patents. We cannot predict the end results other technologies or other competing products could have
on the future potential sales of our services.
We
must rely on relationships with third-party suppliers to supply necessary resources used in our technology. These relationships are not
easy to replace.
We
rely upon others for resources used in the production of predictive biomarkers for the Ignite assay. Problems with any of our suppliers’
facilities or processes could result in failure to produce or a delay in production of adequate information used in the production of
the Ignite assay. This could delay or reduce commercial sales and materially harm our business. Any prolonged interruption in the operations
of our suppliers’ facilities could result in a shortfall in the information necessary to complete our assay.
Our
prospective revenues will be diminished if payors do not adequately cover or reimburse our services.
There
has been and will continue to be significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs
and otherwise implement government control of healthcare costs. In addition, private payors continually seek ways to reduce and control
overall healthcare costs. An increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of
healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications and services. Third-party payors,
including governmental payors such as Medicare and private payors, are scrutinizing new medical products and services and may not cover
or may limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for our services. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients
for any of our existing service candidates or for tests we discover and develop, and a substantial portion of the testing for which we
bill our hospital and laboratory clients may ultimately be paid by third-party payors. Likewise, any pricing pressure exerted by these
third-party payors on our clients may, in turn, be exerted by our clients on us. If the government and other third-party payors do not
provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our tests, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and our financial
condition.
We
are susceptible to risks relating to investigation or audit by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”),
health insurance providers and the IRS.
We
may be audited by CMS or any health insurance provider that pays us for services provided to patients. Any such audit may result in reclaimed
payments, which would decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial performance. Our federal tax returns may be audited by
the IRS and our state tax returns may be audited by applicable state government authorities. Any such audit may result in the challenge
and disallowance of some of our deductions or an increase in our taxable income. We are currently involved in certain such ongoing audits
based on our discontinued regenerative medicine business. No assurance can be made with regard to the deductibility of certain tax items
or the position taken by us on our tax returns. Further, an audit or any litigation resulting from an audit could unexpectedly increase
our expenses and adversely affect financial performance and operations.
10
Regulatory
changes, such as proposed government regulation of LDTs, could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or result in delays,
increased costs, or the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which could harm our business.
We
intend to develop diagnostic tests for clients (an LDT) that cannot currently be provided using test kits approved or cleared by the
FDA. The FDA has been considering changes to the way that it regulates these LDTs. Currently, all LDTs are conducted and offered in accordance
with CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures. The FDA has published a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance
or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified approach for some lower risk LDTs that may require FDA oversight short of the
full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDA’s role
with regard to LDTs. As a result, there is a risk that the FDA’s proposed regulatory process could delay the offering of certain
tests and result in additional validation costs and fees. This FDA approval or clearance process may be time-consuming and costly, with
no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.
In
2014, the FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining
the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. The FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to
finalize its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017,
the FDA published a non-binding “Discussion Paper” proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft
guidance, “to spur further dialogue” and give “congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative
solution.” Recent agency announcements made in the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy
landscape and further uncertainty regarding the FDA’s role in regulating LDTs. In August 2020, the Department of Health and Human
Services (“HHS”) announced that the FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking,
but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to the FDA’s longstanding
approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.
Congress
has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including,
among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both
the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act
of 2021 (“VITAL Act”), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will
enact legislation regulating LDTs, and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in the FDA’s
2014 draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation
may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our
existing tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. If the government begins to regulate our tests, it could
require a significant volume of applications, which would be burdensome. Furthermore, governmental bodies could take a long time to review
such applications and/or document responses if other laboratories were also required to file applications and/or document responses for
each of their LDTs.
In
the event that the FDA begins to regulate our tests, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory
notification or application for commercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of clinical
testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization of any future tests, and interrupt sales of our current
tests. Additionally, the results of pre-clinical trials or previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and clinical
trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Many of the factors that may cause or lead
to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or
approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors,
including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility
criteria for the clinical trial. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests and/or to achieve sustained profitability.
We
are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be adequate and may not be available to
us at a reasonable rate in the future.
Our
business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our technology.
We may be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to oncologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate
reliance upon, the information we provide. We have commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage
may not be adequate to cover all claims against us. There is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the
future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against
us could cause us to incur significant expenses to pay such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development or technology
sales and could cause a decline in our revenues. Even a successfully defended product liability claim could cause us to incur significant
expenses to defend such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development and could cause a decline in our revenues.
In addition, product liability claims could result in an FDA or equivalent non-United States regulatory authority investigation of the
safety or efficacy of our test, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs.
11
We
have exposure to general uncertainty and complex matters regarding the patents we license.
The
patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy
regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the
United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the
patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology and to
enforce the patent rights that we license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop
third parties from using, selling, offering to sell, or importing technology that infringe on our intellectual property will depend in
part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to
both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending
patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may
be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology or the methods of use. Patent and other intellectual
property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third
parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our technology. The issued patents that we in-license
and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors
from marketing related technology or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our technology. In addition,
the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors
with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the
rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect
to our technology. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential technology,
it is possible that, before any particular technology can be commercialized, any patent protection for such technology may expire or
remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
If
we are unable to protect the proprietary rights we license or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively
or operate profitably.
We
develop predictive biomarkers that are the basis for or incorporated in our potential testing products. We protect our technology through
United States and foreign patent filings, trademarks and trade secrets that we license from others.
The
fact that we may file a patent application or that a patent has been issued does not ensure that we will have meaningful protection from
competition with regard to the underlying technology. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, declared unenforceable or circumvented
or may not cover all applications we may desire. Any pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. Patents
may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with, or who could develop, similar or competing
technologies or who could design around our patents. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the pharmaceutical field in which
we operate is continually evolving and can be the subject of some uncertainty. The laws providing patent protection may change in a way
that would limit our protection.
We
also rely on trade secrets and know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require
our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors
to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual
during the course of their relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances.
We also require signed confidentiality agreements from companies that receive our confidential data. For employees, consultants and contractors,
we require confidentiality agreements providing that all inventions conceived while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us
as our exclusive property. It is possible, however, that these parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies
for such a breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known to or be independently developed
by competitors.
We
are also subject to the risk of claims, whether meritorious or not, that our technology infringes or misappropriates third-party intellectual
property rights. Defending against such claims can be quite expensive even if the claims lack merit. If we are found to have infringed
or misappropriated a third-party’s intellectual property, we could be required to seek a license or discontinue using certain technologies
or delay commercialization of the affected technologies, and we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could materially
harm our business.
We
may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend. The outcome
of such a defense in uncertain.
Our
business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships,
or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory
to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. That litigation is likely to be expensive and may require
a significant amount of management’s time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business.
Litigation
relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive, and our position as a relatively small company in an industry
dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our intellectual property rights and in defending
against claims that our technology infringes or misappropriate third-party intellectual property rights. Even if we are able to defend
our position, the cost of doing so may adversely affect our profitability. We may in the future be subject to patent litigation and may
not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost if such litigation is initiated. The outcome of litigation is always
uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities or
otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.
Obtaining
and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements
imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.
Periodic
maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications may be due to be paid
to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), GMU, the NIH, Vanderbilt and various governmental patent agencies
outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental
patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with these requirements. In many cases,
an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there
are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or
complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market creating
a material adverse effect on our business.
12
We
may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
Filing,
prosecuting and defending patents on our technology in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual
property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws
of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States.
Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from
selling or importing technologies using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own technologies and may also export infringing
technologies to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These technologies
may compete with ours and our patents or other intellectual property rights.
If
our product were to become the subject of concerns related to its efficacy, safety, or otherwise, our ability to generate revenues from
our product could be seriously harmed.
With
the use of any newly marketed technology by a wider patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially
do not appear to relate to the technology itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved technology,
cause us to modify how we market our approved technology, subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our revenues and
financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of our product from the commercial market, our revenues would decline significantly
and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail.
Adoption
of our product for the analysis of patients with either early stage or advanced cancer may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons,
including competing therapies and perceived difficulties in the treatment process or delays in obtaining reimbursement. If our product
is not broadly accepted as a technology option for cancer, our business would be harmed.
The
rate of adoption of our product for early stage or advanced cancer and the ultimate market size will be dependent on several factors,
including the education of treating physicians on the information provided by our product. A significant portion of the prospective patient
base for the product may be under the care of oncologists who may have little or no experience with our technology. Acceptance by oncologists
of our product may be slow and may require us to educate physicians on the benefits of using our technology.
To
achieve global success for our product as a technology, we will need to obtain approvals by foreign regulatory authorities. Data from
our completed clinical trials of our product may not be sufficient to support approval for commercialization by regulatory agencies governing
the sale of drugs outside of the United States. This could require us to spend substantial sums to develop sufficient clinical data for
licensure by foreign authorities. Submissions for approval by foreign regulatory authorities may not result in marketing approval by
these authorities. In addition, certain countries require pricing to be established before reimbursement for the specific technology
may be obtained. We may not receive or maintain marketing approvals at favorable pricing levels or at all, which could harm our ability
to market our product globally. Cancer is common in many regions where the healthcare support systems are limited and reimbursement for
our product may be limited or unavailable, which will likely limit or slow adoption in these regions. If we are unable to successfully
achieve the full global market potential of our product due to diagnostic practices or regulatory hurdles, our future prospects would
be harmed, and our stock price could decline.
Our
product in clinical development may be limited in use if we do not maintain or gain required regulatory approvals.
Our
clinical business may be subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States
and potentially by foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country.
Obtaining
regulatory approval for marketing of a technology candidate in one country does not assure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval
in other countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory
process in other countries.
13
In
general, the FDA and equivalent other country authorities require labeling, advertising and promotional materials to be truthful and
not misleading and marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. If the FDA
or other regulatory authorities were to challenge our promotional materials or activities, they may bring enforcement action.
Regulatory
authorities could also add new regulations or reform existing regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain
approval of our technology. Our product is a novel technology. As a result, regulatory agencies lack experience with it, which may lengthen
the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product outside of the United
States. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to regulatory policy affecting our business could occur, and such changes
could have a material adverse impact on our business. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations
in the research and development of our predictive biomarkers, they may not approve the technology candidate and we would not be able
to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our technology candidate, our business and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected.
We
use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.
Our
operations produce hazardous waste products, including chemicals, radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Although we believe
that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials complies with the standards prescribed by state and federal
laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract
with third parties for the disposal of such hazardous waste products. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Additionally, we must comply
with the regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other regulatory statutes,
and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. OSHA and/or the EPA may promulgate regulations that may
affect our research and development programs. We may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental
and safety laws and regulations. In addition, in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we could be held
liable for any damages that result, including remediation, and any such liability could exceed our resources.
Our
management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over our financial reporting.
Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of certain
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses relates to the absence of in-house accounting
personnel with the ability to properly account for complex transactions and the lack of separation of duties between accounting and other
functions.
We anticipate expanding
our accounting functions with dedicated staff and improving our internal accounting procedures and separation of duties when we can absorb
the costs of such expansion and improvement with additional capital resources. In the meantime, management will continue to observe and
assess our internal accounting function and make necessary improvements whenever they may be required. If our remedial measures are insufficient
to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial
reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could
be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we
are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain
compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.
14
Our
ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
We
may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Thus, our ability to utilize
carryforwards of our net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future tax liabilities may be substantially restricted.
Further, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes. Therefore, we may not be
able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal or state tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $59.7 million and $59.7 million, respectively.
Our financial results could be adversely affected
by liabilities from our discontinued operations.
Until recently, we
were a provider of movement and orthopedic therapies and minimally invasive procedures performed through our regenerative and rehabilitative
medical treatments to improve the physical health of our patients at our chain of IMAC Regeneration Centers and BackSpace clinics which
we owned or managed. As of December 31, 2023, we sold or discontinued patient care at all our locations including The BackSpace LLC.
Like other medical
providers, our discontinued operations were subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S. Criminal charges, substantial
fines and/or civil penalties, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public
interest in a matter could result from government investigations of our discontinued business.
Risks
Related to Our Securities
Our
stock price is volatile and an investment could decline in value.
The
market price of our common stock fluctuates substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the
52-week period ending March 26, 2025, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.14 to a high of $7.75. These fluctuations
could cause you to lose all or part of the value of your investment in our common stock and/or warrants. Factors that could cause fluctuations
in the market price of our common stock include the following:
●
quarterly
variations in our results of operations;
●
results
of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
●
results
of operations that vary from those of our competitors;
●
changes
in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts;
●
publication of research reports about us or the outpatient
medical clinic business;
●
announcements
by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;
●
announcements
by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;
●
changes affecting the availability of financing in the
outpatient medical services market;
●
regulatory developments in the outpatient medical clinic
business;
●
significant
future sales of our common stock;
●
additions
or departures of key personnel;
●
the
realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this prospectus; and
●
general
economic, market and currency factors and conditions unrelated to our performance.
In
addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock,
regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities,
securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities
and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
15
Our
issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of Common Stock.
Our
Board of Directors is authorized to issue series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our holders of Common Stock, known
as “blank check” preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms
of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our Common Stock
with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future
that has preference over our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of our Common
Stock or the price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected. In particular, as of March 31, 2025 we had issued and outstanding
2,020 Series C-1 Preferred Shares, 876 Series C-2 Preferred Shares, 14,003 Series D Preferred Shares, 24,172 Series E Preferred Shares,
300 Series F Preferred Shares and 4,676 Series G Preferred Shares which are convertible into an aggregate of 15,483,060 shares of our
common stock.
The
Company’s common stock has been suspended from trading on Nasdaq and currently trades on the OTC Pink Market, which may adversely
affect the flexibility of holders of common stock to resell their securities in the secondary market.
Beginning in 2023, the Company
experienced deficiencies in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, including the Minimum Equity Rule, which required us to maintain a
required minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders’ equity for continued listing, as required under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). We cured
all such deficiencies subject to a one year “Panel Monitor” as that term is defined by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B)
with respect to the Minimum Equity Rule.
On January 21, 2025, the Company
received a Notice from Nasdaq advising the Company that it no longer complied with the Minimum Equity Rule. Due to the Panel Monitor,
the Company was not eligible to submit a plan to the Staff to request an extension of up to 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance
with the Minimum Equity Rule, and as a result, the Staff determined to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.
The Company
appealed the delisting notice at a hearing before Nasdaq on March 4, 2025. On March 24, 2025, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that
our appeal was denied and that the Company’s securities were suspended at the open of trading on March 26, 2025. We expect Nasdaq
to complete the delisting by filing a Notification of Removal from Listing on Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”).
As a result of the suspension
in trading and expected delisting, the Company’s common stock began trading publicly on the OTC Pink Market under its existing
symbols “BACK” on March 26, 2025. The Company intends to apply to have its common stock traded on the OTCQB. There is no
guarantee that such application will be approved or when.
The OTC Pink Market and OTCQB
are significantly more limited markets than Nasdaq, and quotation on the OTC Pink Market or OTCQB will likely result in a less liquid
market for existing and potential holders of the Company’s common stock to trade such securities and could further depress the
trading price of the common stock. The Company can provide no assurance that its common stock will continue to trade on this market,
whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of its common stock on this market, or whether the trading volume of its
common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market for existing and potential holders of its common stock.
16
Trading on the OTC Pink Market
or OTCQB could also harm the Company’s ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us,
or at all, and may result in the loss of confidence in the Company’s financial stability by suppliers, customers and employees.
Investors would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate market quotations for, the common stock, as the liquidity
that Nasdaq provides would no longer be available to investors.
We
do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
We
currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans
to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the
future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results, financial
condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition,
we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends, and our ability to pay dividends
generally may be further limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may
not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you
paid for it.
We
may issue additional shares of common stock, warrants or other securities to finance our growth.
We
may finance the business development or generate additional working capital through additional equity financing. Therefore, subject to
the rules of the Nasdaq, we may issue additional shares of our common stock, warrants and other equity securities of equal or senior
rank, with or without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances from time to time. The issuance by us of shares of our common
stock, warrants or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:
●
the
proportionate ownership interest in us held by our existing stockholders will decrease;
●
the
relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of common stock may be diminished; and
●
the
market price of our common stock may decline.
In
addition, if we issue shares of our common stock and/or warrants in a future offering (or, in the case of our common stock, the exercise
of outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock), it could be dilutive to our security holders.
17
Anti-takeover
provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading
price of our common stock.
Our
corporate documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change
in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. These provisions:
●
authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to help defend against
a takeover attempt;

●
provide that stockholders are only entitled to call a special meeting upon written request by 33.33% of the outstanding common stock;
and
●

In
addition, Delaware law prohibits large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging
or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances. These provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage,
delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and
make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions
you desire.
General
Risk Factors
Failure
to retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our technology and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding.
Companies
like ours depend upon our scientific staff to discover new technologies and predictive biomarker. They utilize these biomarkers to recommend
treatment guidance for cancer patients. The quality and reputation of our scientific, clinical and regulatory staff, especially the senior
staff, and their success in performing their responsibilities, may directly influence the success of our technology development program.
Hiring
and retention is difficult to manage, particularly in light of continually evolving laws relating to noncompete and non-solicitation
agreements, including the Federal Trade Commission’s rule banning most noncompete agreements, which is currently being challenged
by several business entities. We face intense competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research
institutions, government entities and other organizations. In some cases, our competitors have required their employees to agree to non-compete
and/or non-solicitation agreements as part of their employment. We also may not be able to enter such arrangements. Both scenarios present
challenges and potential costs. Additionally, in some cases our relationship with a customer may be impacted by turnover in our team.
As
we pursue successful commercialization of Ignite products, we will need to hire sales and marketing, and operations executive management
staff in order to ensure our organizational success. In addition, we require additional executive officers to provide strategic and operational
guidance. Our inability to recruit key management, scientific, clinical, regulatory, medical, operational and other personnel, may delay
or prevent us from achieving our business objectives.
18
If
we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected.
In
the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information through our information systems. Although we endeavor
to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that
an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our business and employees. Any misappropriation,
loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the
operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant
costs implementing additional security measures and organizational changes, implementing additional protective technologies, training
employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach.
We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally
identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption
to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results
of operations.

CYBERSECURITY
Risk
Management and Strategy
We
have established processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these
processes into our overall risk management systems and processes. We
routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our
information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity,
or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein.
We
conduct periodic risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments in the event of a material change in
our business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments
include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the likelihood and potential damage that could result
from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such risks.
Following
these risk assessments, we re-design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks; reasonably address
any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. Primary responsibility for assessing,
monitoring and managing our cybersecurity risks rests with an IT consultant who reports to our Chief Executive Officer, to manage the
risk assessment and mitigation process.
As
part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration
with IT and management. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity processes through trainings.
We
engage consultants, or other third parties in connection with our risk assessment processes. These service providers assist us to design
and implement our cybersecurity procedures, as well as to monitor and test our safeguards. We require each third-party
service provider to certify that it has the ability to implement
and maintain appropriate security measures, consistent with all applicable laws, to implement and maintain reasonable security measures
in connection with their work with us, and to promptly report any suspected breach of its security measures that may affect our company.
We
have not
encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. For
additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
19
Governance
Our
Board is periodically informed of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Board is responsible for
monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material
risks we face.
Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are primarily responsible to assess and manage our material risks from cybersecurity
threats with assistance from third-party service providers.
Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer oversee our cybersecurity processes, including those described in “Risk Management
and Strategy” above. The cybersecurity risk management program includes tools and activities to prevent, detect, and analyze current
and emerging cybersecurity threats, and plans and strategies to address threats and incidents.

PROPERTIES
We
manage our business operations from our principal executive office in Franklin, Tennessee and laboratory space in Golden, Colorado. We
are in the process of having the lease for the laboratory space we use in Golden, Colorado assigned to us. Our executive office lease
and our laboratory lease are on a month-to-month basis. Our total rent expense was $0.1 million under our office and laboratory lease
for 2024.
We

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS
Lincoln Gardens Partners,
LLC d/b/a Twin Lakes Office Park (“Landlord”), filed a complaint against the Company, IMAC Management of Florida (“IMAC
Florida”), and Mr. Marty Willmitch on March 14, 2025 in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, in and for Hillsborough
County, Florida relating to an alleged default in a foreclosure action regarding a lease by Landlord of the Company’s former clinic
location in Tampa, Florida. The Company has surrendered the premises and is in discussions with the Landlord regarding outstanding amounts
and a potential settlement. The Landlord alleges that the Company may owe approximately $0.15 million for accelerated lease payments,
commissions, costs of tenant improvements, and interest owed in accordance with certain lease agreements.
From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation
is, however, subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe would or could have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on us. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such proceedings or claims may nonetheless
impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary interim rulings.
Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8. Financial
Statements” of this Form 10-K for a description of current legal proceedings.

Information
In
connection with the completion of our initial public offering, our common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market
on February 13, 2019, under the symbols “IMAC” and “IMACW”, respectively. On August 8, 2022, the Company changed
its “IMAC” ticker symbol to “BACK”. Our publicly traded warrants expired in February 2024 and are no longer listed
for trading.
As
of March 31, 2025, there were approximately 63 holders of record of our common stock. We believe that the number of beneficial owners
is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our common stock is held of record through brokerage
firms in “street name.”
Dividend
Policy
Our
board of directors will determine our future dividend policy based on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements
and other circumstances. We have not previously declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock. We anticipate that we will retain
earnings to support operations and finance the growth of our business. Accordingly, it is not anticipated that any cash dividends will
be paid on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth previously under
the caption “Risk Factors.” This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
The
results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods.
21
Overview
IMAC Holdings, Inc. operates
primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, Ignite Proteomics, LLC (Ignite), that utilizes a unique and patented RPPA technology platform,
which can quantify protein signaling to support oncology clinical treatment decisions and biopharmaceutical drug development.
Ignite has recently obtained
credentials to bill Medicare for reimbursement.
For the year ended December 31,
2024, the Company had:
●
$0.07
million in net revenue;
●
net
loss of $9.0 million comprised of ($6.3 million) from our continuing operations and ($2.7 million) from our discontinued operations;
and,
●
a one-time expenses of $2.7 million in discontinued operations
related to a reserve for CMS request for payment related to a Medicare audit.
Matters
that May or Are Currently Affecting Our Business
We
believe that the growth of our business and our future success depend on various opportunities, challenges, trends and other factors,
including the following:
●
Our
ability to obtain additional financing for the projected costs associated with the growth of our recently acquired laboratory;
●
Our
ability to attract competent, skilled laboratory and sales personnel for our operations at acceptable prices to manage our overhead;
and
Critical
Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates,
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences
between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates
on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations
for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.
We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the
time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or
use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined
above.
For a detailed discussion
of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December
31, 2024 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023
Revenues, net
The Company’s revenue is diversified between
biopharmaceutical drug development, contract research and patient or third party payors. The Company had revenues of $.07 million and
$0 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consisted of laboratory
supplies of $0.2 million and depreciation expense of $0.1 million.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses were $5.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2024. They consisted of $1.8 million for salaries and benefits, $1.2 million in legal fees, $1.6 million
in professional fees and consulting, $0.3 million in insurance, $0.2 million for occupancy and $0.3 million for other expenses.
Discontinued
Operations
Costs and expenses incurred in discontinued
operations relate to the legal accrual associated with the Progressive Health matter.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2024, we had $0.5 million in cash and a working capital deficit of $(6.5) million. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash
of $0.2 million and working capital of $(0.8) million. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in
accounts payable, $1.1 million increase in dividends payable and $2.7 million related to the reserve for the Medicare audit.
As
of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $7.2 million in current liabilities. Approximately $2.7 million of our current liabilities
outstanding were to our vendors, $0.5 million were dividends payable to our preferred shareholders and $4.0 million for liabilities of
discontinued operations. Of the discontinued operations liabilities, $2.7 million relates to the reserve for the Medicare audit and $0.5
are for operating leases.
As
of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $65.0 million. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to
fund future operations. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed or favorable
terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate
our development or acquisition activity. Failure to receive additional funding could also cause us to cease operations, in part or in
full. Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current of future operating plans, we may seek additional capital
due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations. Our management team has determined that our financial condition raises
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
Cash Flows
The primary source of our operating
cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from patients, private insurance companies, government programs, self-insured employers
and other payers.
During the year ended December
31, 2024, net cash used in operations increased to $3.2 million compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease
was primarily attributable to our increase in accounts payable.
Net cash used in investing activities
during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $0.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to
the previous years’ sale of physician practices and property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing
activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3.9 million, which was primarily proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, net
of related fees, and issuance of promissory notes. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023
was $4.0 million, including proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, net of related fees.
Impact
of Inflation
We
believe that inflation had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024. Inflation was evident
in staffing and supply costs related to the delivery of patient care. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an
adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
IMAC
Holdings, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of IMAC Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024,
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for
the
year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
We
also audited the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items in Note 15 that have been disclosed for 2023 due to the adoption
of ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, and the recast of the
segment disclosures in Note 15 to reflect one reportable segment. In our opinion, such disclosures are appropriate. However, we were
not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect
to these disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2023 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.
Explanatory
Paragraph – Going Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 4, the Company has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has restated
its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2024 to correct misstatements.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of:
IMAC
Holdings, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of IMAC Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for the
year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as
of December 31, 2023, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had historical net losses and net cash used in operating activities,
has discontinued operations and will require additional financing to continue operations in 2024. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s Plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of
our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

operations
The
continuing operations of the business are precision medicine in cancer treatment based on activated protein analysis. The Company has
acquired laboratory capabilities from Theralink Technologies, Inc, and has the technical capability and intellectual property licenses
to engage in clinical testing of breast cancer patients to determine which medications and treatments will be most effective. The Company
also engages in collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies to identify drug targets based on activated protein analysis. Drug makers
benefit from the application of our technology in target identification, clinical trial design, and clinical trial execution.
On
August 30, 2024, the Company amended its 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder
from 66,667
to 566,667
shares.
Discontinued
operations
Until
recently, IMAC Holdings, Inc. was a holding company for IMAC Regeneration Centers, The BackSpace retail stores and our Investigational
New Drug division. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has sold or discontinued patient care at all our locations and has accordingly

Note
2 – Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
Management,
in concurrence with the Company’s Audit Committee, concluded that the Company’s previously issued financial statements included
in the Company’s previously issued audited year end financial information included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2024 (“the Affected Financial Statements”) should no longer be relied upon.
Details of the restated consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2024 are provided below
(“Restatement Items”). The Company evaluated the materiality of these errors both qualitatively and quantitatively in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99, Materiality and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, and determined the effect of these corrections were material to the
Affected Financial Statements. As a result of the material misstatements, the Company has restated our Affected Financial Statements,
in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
The
Restatement Items primarily reflect adjustments to correct errors with respect to the accounting for its preferred dividends and earnings
per share.
The
Company has also updated all accompanying footnotes and disclosures affected by the Restatement Items, within Note 9. Shareholders’
Equity (Deficit).

3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”) as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) through
the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”).
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of IMAC Holdings, Inc. and the following entities which are consolidated due to direct ownership of a controlling
voting interest or other rights granted to us as the sole general partner or managing member of the entity: Ignite Proteomics, LLC (“Ignite”),
IMAC Regeneration Center of St. Louis, LLC (“IMAC St. Louis”), IMAC Management Services, LLC (“IMAC Management”),
IMAC Regeneration Management, LLC (“IMAC Texas”) IMAC Regeneration Management of Nashville, LLC (“IMAC Nashville”)
IMAC Management of Illinois, LLC (“IMAC Illinois”), Advantage Hand Therapy and Orthopedic Rehabilitation, LLC (“Advantage
Therapy”), IMAC Management of Florida, LLC (“IMAC Florida”), Louisiana Orthopaedic & Sports Rehab (“IMAC
Louisiana”) and The Back Space, LLC (“BackSpace”); the following entity which is consolidated with IMAC Regeneration

with Louisiana Orthopaedic & Sports Rehab due to control by contract: IMAC Medical of Louisiana, a Medical Corporation; and the following
entities which are consolidated with BackSpace due to control by contract: ChiroMart LLC, ChiroMart Florida LLC, and ChiroMart Missouri
LLC.
Use
of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses at the date and for the periods that the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On an ongoing basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to contractual insurance adjustments on revenues and expected credit losses,
impairment of long-lived assets including intangible assets, valuation of loans receivable and valuation of stock-based compensation.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
33
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company accounts for its revenue transactions under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) through the Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”).
In accordance with ASC Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenues when its customers obtain control of its product for an amount
that reflects the consideration it expects to receive from its customers in exchange for that product. To determine revenue recognition
for contracts that are determined to be in scope of ASC Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i)
identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the
Company satisfies the performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that
the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once
the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each
contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The
Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when
such performance obligation is satisfied.
In 2024, the Company’s revenue is diversified
between biopharmaceutical drug development, contract research and patient or third party payors. Revenue is recognized when the analysis
report is submitted to the customer.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature. The
carrying amount of the line of credit and note payable approximates fair values due to their market interest rates. Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had
no cash
equivalents at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Note
Receivable
Note
Receivable is a subordinated promissory note and a convertible promissory note that the Company’s merger partner, Theralink Technologies,
Inc. (“THER”) entered into during July of 2023 and August of 2023, respectively. Each note is due to be repaid within one
year and contains interest compounding at 6.0%.
The convertible promissory note also contains a convertible feature at the option of the Company into THER common stock at a fixed price
of $0.00313 per share. The total amount loaned
between the two notes was $3.0 million.  The
Company determined the fair value of the notes and related accrued interest owed as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $0.7 million
(their principal balance less a credit loss allowance under ASU 2016-13 of approximately $2.3 million
which was recorded as an impairment of assets in 2023) given the current financial position of THER and their perceived lack of ability
to re-pay these notes as of December 31, 2023.
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into several financing transactions with Theralink Technologies, Inc. (“Theralink”)
that culminated in an acquisition of Theralink assets. Pursuant to the Settlement and Release Agreement dated May 1, 2024, the Company
acquired certain assets which resulted in the recording of long lived assets of $1.1
million. The receivables of $1.1
million under the senior secured convertible debentures of Theralink (the “Theralink Notes”) was settled as part of the arrangement.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized
at cost. Depreciation of owned assets are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The cost of assets
sold or retired, and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected
in other income (expense) for the year. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Long-Lived
Assets
Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment, operating lease assets and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Income
Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax
credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by
a valuation allowance to the extent that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. Specifically,
we reclassified $0.13 million
dividend payable out of accrued expenses into a separate line item and reclassified salaries and benefits, advertising and marketing,
and depreciation and amortization into the one line item titled general and administrative.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
On
December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires
entities to disclose specific rate reconciliations, amount of income taxes separated by federal and individual jurisdiction, and the
amount of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between federal, state, and foreign.
The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.
34
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 requires that a public
entity that has a single reportable segment, such as the Company, provide all the disclosures required by the existing segment disclosure
requirements in Topic 280, as amended. These segment disclosures include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included with each reported measure of segment loss, disclosure of other segment items
by reportable segment and a description of the segment’s composition, disclosures about our reportable segment’s profit or
loss and assets currently required, disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported
measure(S) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted ASU 2023-07
effective for the year ended December 31, 2024, and have retrospectively applied it to all periods presented.
In December 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income- Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (ASU 2024-03). ASU 2024-03 requires disclosure
of specific information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to its financial statements for interim and annual reporting periods.
The objective of the disclosure requirements is to provide disaggregated information to help financial statement users (a) better understand
the Company’s performance, (b) better assess the Company’s prospects for future cash flows, and (c) compare the Company’s
performance over time and with that of other entities. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact
that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Note
4 –Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and includes the assumption of a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
historically and expects to incur operating losses and cash outflows from operations and as a result concludes that there is substantial
doubt to continue as a going concern twelve months from the issuance of these statements. Management plans to raise additional capital through the issuance of financial instruments including both debt and
equity to mitigate the conditions and events that raise substantial doubt.
These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

9 – Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit)
Preferred Stock 2023
On July 25, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive
securities purchase agreement with several institutional and accredited investors, including existing significant investors of Theralink
Technologies, Inc., its previously announced merger partner (OTC:THER) (“Theralink”), and Theralink’s Chairman, for
the sale of its preferred stock and warrants. IMAC sold an aggregate of 2,500
shares of its Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, stated value $1,000
per share, 1,800
shares of its Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, stated value $1,000
per share, and Warrants to purchase up to 2,075,702
shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $4.3
million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses of $480,000.
The shares of A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, shall bear a 12%
dividend based on stated, value have no voting rights, and are initially convertible into an aggregate of 763,126
shares of common stock of the Company, and the shares of Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock are initially convertible into an aggregate
of 549,451
shares of common stock of the Company, in each case, at a conversion price of $3.276
per share. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.276
per share, are exercisable immediately, and will expire five
years from the date of shareholder approval of this private placement. The shares contain price protection provisions and beneficial
ownership limitation provisions upon conversion as defined in the certificates of designation. Approximately $3.0
million of the proceeds of the offering was used to make two loans to Theralink for investment into sales and marketing efforts and general
working capital purposes as the companies continue to take formal steps together in advancing their merger previously announced on May
23, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 dividends of approximately $130,000
have been declared and accrued on the Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock.
The Company also entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement, pursuant to which it agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
covering the resale of the shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A-2
Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrants no later than 45 days following the closing of the planned merger.
On December 20, 2023, the Company entered into a
letter agreement with several institutional and accredited investors providing for the sale of an additional aggregate $250,000
of convertible preferred stock (the “Private Placement”) with offering expenses of approximately $25,000.
Pursuant to the letter agreement, the Company exchanged its Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred
stock for a corresponding number of shares of the Company’s newly-created Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and the Company’s
newly-created Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively. Shares of the Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B-2
Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.84 per share, which
is above the most recent closing price of the Company’s common stock and represents a reduction in the conversion price from the
Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Therefore, the Series B-1 and B-2 preferred stock
is convertible into 1,437,500
and 1,035,326
common shares, respectively. In addition, the exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $1.84
pursuant to the letter agreement. The reduction in the conversion price and the exercise price was made in consideration of the additional
purchase amount, therefore there was no accounting effect of this exchange. It is expected that the proceeds of the Private Placement
will be used for general working capital and general corporate purposes.
All terms other than the conversion price are the
same as the Series A-1 and A-2.
In 2024, the Series B-1 and B-2 preferred shares
were exchanged for Series C-1 and C-2 preferred shares.
Preferred
Stock sold for cash
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold 1,276,
17,364,
24,172,
450
and 4,676
shares of Series C-2, Series D, Series E, Series F and Series
G preferred stock, respectively, for gross proceeds of $5.09
million.
The
Company used $2.2
million of the Series G proceeds to repay $2.2
million of outstanding promissory notes of the Company and
accordingly, the Company had no
debt outstanding after such repayments.
Series
C-2, Series D, Series E, Series F and Series G preferred stock have dividends equal to 10%
per annum. Series D, Series E and Series F dividends are capitalized
by increasing the stated value of each preferred share on the dividend date.
In
connection with the sale of preferred stock in 2024, the Company issued common stock purchase warrants of 5.7
million with a weighted average exercise price of $2.00.
The warrants were accounted for in equity and have a value of $11.5
million.
Inputs
associated with the value of those warrants is Contractual term of 5
years, Volatility of 149%,
Dividend Yield of 0%
and risk free rate of 4.43%.

stock exchanged
During
the year ended December 31, 2024, certain investors exchanged 4,550
shares of Series B-1 and B-2 preferred stock for shares of
Series C-1 preferred stock. The share exchange was accounted for as a modification; however, the difference in fair value was de minimis.
The Series C-1 have dividends equal to 10%
per annum.

11 - Net Loss Per Share
Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average of common shares outstanding
during the year, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of the conversion option embedded in convertible
debt. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would have a
potentially dilutive effect.
Dilutive
shares not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because the effect would be potentially dilutive due to the Company’s
net loss were as follows:

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company’s patient service revenue was derived from non-surgical procedures performed at our outpatient medical clinics. The fees
for such services were billed either to the patient or a third-party payer, including Medicare.
The
Company recognized service revenues based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and
third-party payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
The Company also records estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured
accounts to record these revenues at the estimated amounts expected to be collected.
Starting
in January 2020, the Company implemented wellness maintenance programs on a subscription basis. There were four membership plans offered
with different levels of service for each plan. The Company recognized membership revenue on a monthly basis. Enrollment in the wellness
maintenance program can occur at any time during the month and can be dis-enrolled at any time.
Starting
in June 2021, the Company introduced BackSpace and began offering outpatient chiropractic and spinal care services as well as memberships
services in Walmart retail locations. The fees for such services were paid and recognized as incurred.
Starting
in September 2022, the Company introduced hormone replacement therapy “HRT” and medical weight loss programs. The Company
recognized HRT and medical weight loss revenue as the services are provided.
Other
management service fees are derived from management services where the Company provided billings and collections support to the clinics
and where management services were provided based on state specific regulations known as the corporate practice of medicine (“CPM”).
Under the CPM, a business corporation is precluded from practicing medicine or employing a physician to provide professional medical
services. In these circumstances, the Company provides all administrative support to the physician-owned PC through a LLC. The PC is
consolidated due to control by contract (an “MSA” – Management Services Agreement). The fees we derive from these management
arrangements are either based on a predetermined percentage of the revenue of each clinic or a percentage mark up on the costs of the
LLC. The company recognized other management service revenue in the period in which services were rendered. These revenues are earned
by IMAC Nashville, IMAC Management, IMAC Illinois, IMAC Florida, IMAC Louisiana and the Back Space and are eliminated in consolidation
to the extent owned.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable primarily consists of amounts due from third-party payers (non-governmental), governmental payers and private pay patients
and is recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts and contractual discounts. The Company’s ability to collect outstanding
receivables is critical to its results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, accounts receivable reported in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements is recorded at the net amount expected to be received.
The
Company’s accounts receivable from third-party payers are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments and allowances from
third-party payers, which are estimated based on the historical trend of the Company’s facilities’ cash collections and contractual
write-offs, accounts receivable aging, established fee schedules, relationships with payers and procedure statistics. While changes in
estimated reimbursement from third-party payers remain a possibility, the Company expects that any such changes would be minimal and,
therefore, would not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company’s
collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor, size of claim and estimated collection percentage for each patient
account. The Company analyzes accounts receivable at each of the facilities to ensure the proper collection and aged category. The operating
systems generate reports that assist in the collection efforts by prioritizing patient accounts. Collection efforts include direct contact
with insurance carriers or patients and written correspondence.

Allowance
for Contractual, Other Discounts and Doubtful Accounts
Management
estimates the allowance for contractual and other discounts based on its historical collection experience and contracted relationship
with the payers. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation and negotiation that
could result in payments that differ from the Company’s estimates.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” This
ASU added a new impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) that is based on expected losses
rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. As
a result, the Company changed its accounting policy for allowance for doubtful accounts using an expected losses model rather than using
incurred losses. The new model is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset based on the Company’s
expectations as of the balance sheet date through analyzing historical customer data as well as taking into consideration current economic
trends.
As
a smaller reporting Company pursuant to Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, these changes became effective
for the Company on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
38
Variable Interest
Entities
Certain states prohibit the “corporate practice
of medicine,” which restricts business corporations from practicing medical care by exercising control over clinical decisions
by doctors. In states which prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, the Company entered into long-term management agreements with
professional corporations (“PCs”) that are owned by licensed doctors, which, in turn employ or contract with doctors who
provide professional care in its clinics. Under these management agreements with PCs, the Company provided, on an exclusive basis, all
non-clinical services of the practice.
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of variable interest entities (“VIE”) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary under the provisions of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification 810, “Consolidation”. The Company has the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact a VIE’s economic performance. Additionally, the Company would absorb the substantially all of the expected
losses from any of these entities should such expected losses occur. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s consolidated
VIE’s include 12 PCs and 12 PCs, respectively.
The total assets (excluding
goodwill and intangible assets, net) of the consolidated VIEs included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December
31, 2024 and 2023, were approximately $0.0
million and ($3.9) million
respectively, and the total liabilities of the consolidated VIEs were approximately $2.9 million
and $0.2 million,
respectively.

The
Company has federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $59.7
million and state net operating losses of approximately $59.7
million. There is no expiration of the federal loss carryforwards
as all federal net operating loss carryforwards were generated after December 31, 2017. The state operating loss carryforwards are subject
to expiration beginning on December 31, 2031.
ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, a full valuation allowance
was required.
In
addition, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its uncertain tax positions and determined that no liabilities or related interest
and penalties were necessary relating to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024. The Company’s federal and state income
tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities for three years after the returns are filed, and the Company’s federal
and state income tax returns for 2021 and 2023 remain open to examination. The primary state income tax returns are for Florida, Illinois,
Kentucky,and Missouri. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company has not yet filed its federal and state income tax returns
for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company does not have any Uncertain Tax Positions (“UTPs”) as of the reporting
date. However, if UTPs were to arise, the Company’s policy would be to recognize interest and penalties related to UTPs in the
income statement as part of income tax expense.

From
time to time, in the ordinary course of business with respect to our discontinued operations, we are subject to audits under various
governmental programs in which third party firms engaged by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) conduct
extensive reviews of claims data to identify potential improper payments. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any regulatory reviews
or other governmental audits and investigations.
Progressive
Health
In
October 2021, the Company received notification from Covent Bridge Group (“Covent Bridge”), a CMS contractor, that they are
recommending to CMS that the Company was overpaid and a request for payment was made in December 2021 in the amount of approximately
$2.7
million.
The
amount represents a statistical extrapolation of charges from a sample of claims for the periods July 2017 to November 2020 for Progressive
Health & Rehabilitation, Ltd (“Progressive Health”). The Company entered into a management agreement with Progressive
Health in April 2019.
The
Company has initiated the appropriate appeals. The Company submitted a redetermination request in March 2022, which was denied. The Company
submitted a reconsideration request February 2023. In July 2023, the Company received a reconsideration decision from the second appeal.
The Qualified Independent Contractor provided a partially favorable decision that medical necessity supported a portion of the claims.
The Company filed an appeal and a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) was conducted November 2023. The ALJ decision received
on February 2024 did not address the Company’s appeal and the impact on the partially favorable decision from the Independent contractor
and the potential impact on the extrapolated charges.
The
Company filed an appeal to Medicare Appeals Council in April 2024 and the result was unfavorable. The Company plans to continue its appeal
by seeking relief from a U.S. District Court. The Company has reserved the request for payment amount of approximately $2.7
million.

Advantage
Therapy
In
May 2022 the Company received notifications from Covent Bridge, that they are recommending to CMS that the Company was overpaid and a
request for payment was made in the amount of approximately $0.5
million.
The Company submitted a reconsideration request
in May 2023. In August 2023 the Company received a reconsideration decision from the second appeal. The Qualified Independent Contractor
provided a partially favorable decision supporting the appealed claims.
Subsequent
to the findings of the second Appeal the Company filed an appeal and conducted a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge in February
2024. The Company awaits the response from the hearing.
IMAC
St. Louis
In
November 2024, the Company received notification from Covent Bridge, that it estimates the Company was overpaid CMS funds in the amount
of approximately $1.1
million at a patient center in Missouri. The overpayment occurred
between February 26, 2020 through January 2, 2024.
Note
15 – Segment Reporting
The
Company has determined that it currently operates in a single segment, precision medicine in cancer treatment, currently located in a
single geographic location, the United States. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies. Since the Company operates in a single segment, the measure of segment total assets and loss from
operations is the same as that reported on the accompanying balance sheets as total assets, and the accompanying statement of operations
as loss from operations, respective.
The
Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer. The Company’s CODM reviews
and evaluates the total consolidated net loss for purposes of assessing performance, making operating decisions, allocating resources,
and planning and forecasting for future periods. In addition to the significant expense categories included within the total net
loss presented on the Company’s Statements of Operations, the following table sets forth significant segment expenses:

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
(1)
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As
further discussed below, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of December
31, 2024, due to material weaknesses discussed below.
(2)
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013), our management concluded that, because our internal controls over financial report were not effective as of December 31,
2024, our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 12a-15E and 15d-15E under the Exchange Act were not effective as of December
31, 2024 and 2023.
The
material weaknesses relate to the absence of in-house accounting personnel with the ability to properly account for complex transactions
and a lack of separation of duties between accounting and other functions. Three material weaknesses are as follows:
1.The Company does not have
sufficient resources in our accounting department, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information
related to financial reporting, including applying complex accounting principles relating to accrued dividends, capitalized
dividends, consolidation accounting, related party transactions, fair value estimates, accounting contingencies and analysis of
financial instruments for proper classification in the consolidated financial statements, in a timely manner.
2.Due
to the Company’s size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always
be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation
of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation
of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that
the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
3.The
Company has not sufficiently designed and implemented operating controls surrounding accounting
policies and controls to ensure the Company’s books and records are recorded in accordance
with US GAAP.
Remediation
We
hired a consulting firm to advise on technical issues related to U.S. GAAP as related to the maintenance of our accounting books and
records and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Although we are aware of the risks associated with not having dedicated
accounting personnel, we are also at an early stage in the development of our business. We anticipate expanding our accounting functions
with dedicated staff and improving our internal accounting procedures and separation of duties when we can absorb the costs of such expansion
and improvement with additional capital resources. In the meantime, management will continue to observe and assess our internal accounting
function and make necessary improvements whenever they may be required. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material
weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered
or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate
our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce
accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with
applicable stock exchange listing requirements.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except
as described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Code
of Ethics
We
have adopted a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (“Ethics Code”) that applies to all our officers, directors, employees,
and contractors. The Ethics Code contains general guidelines for conducting our business consistent with the highest standards of business
ethics and compliance with applicable law, and is intended to qualify as a “code of ethics” within the meaning of Section
406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 406 of Regulation S-K. Day-to-day compliance with the Ethics Code is overseen by the Company
compliance officer appointed by our Board of Directors. The Ethics Code is available on our website at https://ir.imacregeneration.com.
If we make any substantive amendments to the Ethics Code or grant any waiver from a provision of the Ethics Code to any director or executive
officer, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website.
Insider Trading Policy
The Company has adopted an
insider trading policy and procedures governing the purchase, sale, and other dispositions of our securities by directors, officers,
and employees that we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and applicable
Nasdaq listing standards. Our insider trading policy states, among other things, that our directors, officers, and employees are prohibited
from trading in such securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information. The foregoing summary of our insider trading
policies and procedures does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to our Insider Trading Policy filed as an exhibit
to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, with regard to the Company’s trading in its own securities, it is our policy to
comply with the federal securities laws and the applicable exchange listing requirements.
Board
Composition
Our
business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. The number of directors is determined by our board of
directors, subject to the terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Our board of directors currently consists of five members.
Director
Independence
Or
common stock is listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq rules, independent directors must comprise a majority of
a listed company’s board of directors. In addition, Nasdaq rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of
a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees must be independent. Under Nasdaq rules, a director
will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person
does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director.
Audit
committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity
as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (i) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting,
advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) be an affiliated person of the listed
company or any of its subsidiaries.
45
Our
board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based
upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including
family relationships, our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Beitsch, Busch, Evans, Pruitt and Schwartz, representing all
of our directors, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under Nasdaq rules. In making these
determinations, our board of directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other
facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership
of our capital stock by each non-employee director.
Board
Committees
Our
board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance
committee. Under Nasdaq rules, the membership of the audit committee is required to consist entirely of independent directors, subject
to applicable phase-in periods. The following is a brief description of our committees.
Audit
committee. In accordance with our audit committee charter, our audit committee oversees our corporate accounting and financial
reporting processes and our internal controls over financial reporting; evaluates the independent public accounting firm’s qualifications,
independence and performance; engages and provides for the compensation of the independent public accounting firm; approves the retention
of the independent public accounting firm to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; reviews our consolidated financial
statements; reviews our critical accounting estimates and internal controls over financial reporting; and discusses with management and
the independent registered public accounting firm the results of the annual audit and the reviews of our quarterly consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audit committee members meet the requirements for financial literacy under the current requirements of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. In addition, the board of directors has determined that Michael D. Pruitt
is qualified as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of SEC regulations. We have made this determination based on information
received by our board of directors, including questionnaires provided by the members of our audit committee. The audit committee is composed
of Messrs. Pruitt (Chairman), Evans and Busch.
Compensation
committee. In accordance with our compensation committee charter, our compensation committee reviews and recommends policies
relating to compensation and benefits of our officers and employees, including reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives
relevant to compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers, evaluating the performance of these officers in light
of those goals and objectives and setting compensation of these officers based on such evaluations. The compensation committee also administers
the issuance of stock options and other awards under our equity-based incentive plans. We believe that the composition of our compensation
committee meets the requirements for independence under, and the functioning of our compensation committee complies with, any applicable
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. We intend to comply with future requirements to the extent
they become applicable to us. The compensation committee is composed of Messrs. Evans (Chairman), Pruitt and Schwartz.
Nominating
and governance committee. In accordance with our nominating and governance committee charter, our nominating and governance committee
recommends to the board of directors nominees for election as directors, and meets as necessary to review director candidates and nominees
for election as directors; recommends members for each committee of the board; oversee corporate governance standards and compliance
with applicable listing and regulatory requirements; develops and recommends to the board governance principles applicable to the company;
and oversee the evaluation of the board and its committees. We believe that the composition of our nominating and governance committee
meets the requirements for independence under, and the functioning of our compensation committee complies with, any applicable requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations. We intend to comply with future requirements to the extent they become
applicable to us. The nominating and governance committee is composed of Messrs. Busch (Chairman), Beitsch and Schwartz.
46
Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None
of the members of our compensation committee is an executive officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers serves
as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our
board of directors or compensation committee.
Limitations
on Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification
Our
certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides
that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors,
except liability for:
●
any
breach of their duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;
●
acts
or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
●
unlawful
payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or
●
any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
Our
certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Any repeal of or modification to our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director or officer for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring
prior to such amendment or repeal. Our bylaws will also provide that we shall advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance
of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee
or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us, regardless of whether our
bylaws permit such indemnification.
We
intend to enter into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification
provided for in our bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers
for certain expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts incurred by a director or
executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of such person’s services as one of our directors or executive officers,
or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. We believe that these provisions and agreements
are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers.
47
The
limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are contained in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of
derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders.
Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards
against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving
one of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened
litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.
The
Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight
Our
Board of Directors, as a whole and also at the committee level, has an active role in managing enterprise risk. The members of our Board
of Directors participate in our risk oversight assessment by receiving regular reports from members of senior management and the Company
compliance officer appointed by our Board of Directors on areas of material risk to us, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory,
and strategic and reputational risks. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our
executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee oversees management of financial risks, as well as our policies with
respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Nominating and Governance Committee manages risks associated with the independence
of our Board of Directors and potential conflicts of interest. Members of the management team report directly to our Board of Directors
or the appropriate committee. The directors then use this information to understand, identify, manage, and mitigate risk. Once a committee
has considered the reports from management, the chairperson will report on the matter to our full Board of Directors at the next meeting
of the Board of Directors, or sooner if deemed necessary. This enables our Board of Directors and its committees to effectively carry
out its risk oversight role.
Communications
with our Board of Directors
Any
stockholder may send correspondence to our Board of Directors, c/o IMAC Holdings, Inc., 3401 Mallory Lane, Suite 100, Franklin, Tennessee
37067 and our telephone number is (303) 898-5896. Our management will review all correspondence addressed to our Board of Directors,
or any individual director, and forward all such communications to our Board of Directors or the appropriate director prior to the next
regularly scheduled meeting of our Board of Directors following the receipt of the communication, unless the corporate secretary decides
the communication is more suitably directed to Company management and forwards the communication to Company management. Our management
will summarize all stockholder correspondence directed to our Board of Directors that is not forwarded to our Board of Directors and
will make such correspondence available to our Board of Directors for its review at the request of any member of our Board of Directors.

of ownership and changes in ownership of our securities (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC. To the best of our knowledge, based solely on
a review of the Section 16(a) reports and written statements from executive officers and directors, for the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, all required reports of executive officers, directors and holders of more than 10% of our equity securities were filed

Incentive Compensation Plan
Under
our 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”), adopted by our board of directors and holders of a majority of our outstanding
shares of common stock in May 2018, 66,667 shares (after giving effect to an adjustment approved by the Compensation Committee on April
30, 2024 in light of the 1-for-30 reverse stock split effected in September 2023) of common stock (subject to certain adjustments) were
authorized for issuance upon exercise of stock options and grants of other equity awards. On August 30, 2024, with approval of holders
of a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, the Company amended the Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance under the Plan from 66,667 to 566,667 shares of common stock. The Plan is designed to serve as an incentive for
attracting and retaining qualified and motivated employees, officers, directors, consultants and other persons who provide services to
us. The compensation committee of our board of directors administers and interprets the Plan and is authorized to grant stock options
and other equity awards thereunder to all eligible employees of our company, including non-employee consultants to our company and directors.
The
Plan provides for the granting of “incentive stock options” (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), non-statutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, dividend equivalents, bonus stock
and awards in lieu of cash compensation, other stock-based awards and performance awards. Options may be granted under the Plan on such
terms and at such prices as determined by the compensation committee of the board, except that the per share exercise price of the stock
options cannot be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Each option will be exercisable after the
period or periods specified in the stock option agreement, but all stock options must be exercised within ten years from the date of
grant. Options granted under the Plan are not transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The compensation
committee of the board has the authority to amend or terminate the Plan, provided that no amendment shall be made without stockholder
approval if such stockholder approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement. Unless terminated sooner, the Plan
will terminate ten years from its effective date.

SECURITY
OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
The
following table sets forth information as of March 31, 2025 regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock by (i) each person
we know to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our common stock, (ii) each of our named executive officers, as defined below, (iii)
each of our directors, and (iv) all of our current executive officers and directors as a group. Information with respect to beneficial
ownership has been furnished by each director and executive officer, as the case may be. There are no beneficial owners of 5% or more
of our common stock other than the directors and executive officers included below. The address for all executive officers and directors
is c/o IMAC Holdings, Inc., 3401 Mallory Lane, Suite 100, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
Percentage
of beneficial ownership in the table below is calculated based on 3,784,966 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2025.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities
to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities and includes shares of our common
stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options, warrants or other securities that are immediately exercisable or convertible
or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the Record Date. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this

CERTAIN
RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Policies
and Procedures for Transactions with Related Persons
Our
board of directors intends to adopt a written related person transaction policy to set forth the policies and procedures for the review
and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Related persons include any executive officer, director or a holder of more
than 5% of our common stock, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Related
person transactions refers to any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships
in which (i) we were or are to be a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and (iii) a related person had or will have
a direct or indirect material interest. Related person transactions include, without limitation, purchases of goods or services by or
from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, and
employment by us of a related person, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act.
We
expect that the policy will provide that in any related person transaction, our audit committee and board of directors will consider
all of the available material facts and circumstances of the transaction, including: the direct and indirect interests of the related
persons; in the event the related person is a director (or immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is
affiliated), the impact that the transaction will have on a director’s independence; the risks, costs and benefits of the transaction
to us; and whether any alternative transactions or sources for comparable services or products are available. After considering all such
facts and circumstances, our audit committee and board of directors will determine whether approval or ratification of the related person
transaction is in our best interests. For example, if our audit committee determines that the proposed terms of a related person transaction
are reasonable and at least as favorable as could have been obtained from unrelated third parties, it will recommend to our board of
directors that such transaction be approved or ratified. In addition, if a related person transaction will compromise the independence
of one of our directors, our audit committee may recommend that our board of directors reject the transaction if it could affect our
ability to comply with securities laws and regulations or Nasdaq listing requirements.
Related
Party Transactions
On February 14, 2025, the Company
issued a promissory note to Jeffrey Busch, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, in the principal amount of $22,000, for an aggregate
purchase price of $20,000. On March 13, 2025, the Company issued a promissory note to Jeffrey Busch in the principal amount of $27,500,
for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On March 19, 2025, the Company issued a promissory note to Jeffrey Busch in the principal
amount of $16,500, for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000. The notes are unsecured and mature on the earlier of (i) November 14,
2025, and (ii) the initial time of consummation by the Company after the date hereof of any public or private offering(s), individually
or in the aggregate, of securities with gross proceeds of at least $1 million.
Other than as discussed above,
there have been no transactions between the Company and a related person that would be reportable under SEC rules or regulations.
Indemnification
Agreements
We
have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements and
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware law.
Director
Independence
Our
Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Beitsch, Busch, Evans, Pruitt and Schwartz, representing all of our directors, are independent
directors (as currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing rules). In determining the independence of our directors, the
Board of Directors considered all transactions in which the Company and any director had any interest, including those discussed above.
The independent directors meet as often as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, including meeting at least twice annually in
executive session without the presence of non-independent directors and management.

PRINCIPAL
ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES
On
December 28, 2023, Cherry Bekaert LLP (“Cherry Bekaert”) resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm of
the Company. Neither the Company’s Board of Directors nor the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Audit
Committee”) took part in Cherry Bekaert’s decision to resign.
The
Audit Committee conducted a search to determine the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm following the resignation
of Cherry Bekaert. On February 8, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Salberg & Company, P.A. (“Salberg”)
as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, subject to satisfactory completion of standard engagement acceptance
procedures, which were subsequently completed. On June 26, 2024, Salberg was terminated as the independent registered public accounting
firm of the Company.
The Audit Committee conducted
a search to determine the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the termination of Salberg.
On June 26, 2024, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Marcum, LLP (“Marcum”) as the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, subject to satisfactory completion of standard engagement acceptance procedures, which were subsequently
completed.
During
the Company’s two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period preceding Marcum or Salberg’s engagement, neither
the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted Marcum or Salberg regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, and neither Marcum or Salberg provided either a written report or oral advice to the Company that was an important factor
considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue, or (2) any matter that
was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is used in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to
Item 304 of Regulation S-K) on accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures or
a “reportable event” (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The
following table sets forth the aggregate accounting fees paid by us for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the year ended December
31, 2023. The below audit fees were paid to Marcum for the year ended December 31, 2024, Salberg for the years ended December 31, 2024
and 2023 and Cherry Bekaert for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. All non-audit related services in the table were pre-approved

Related Fees. We incurred fees in connection with accounting reviews for S-1 filings and agreed-upon procedures.
Audit
Committee Pre-Approval of Services by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Section
10A(i)(1) of the Exchange Act and related SEC rules require that all auditing and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our
principal accountants be approved in advance by the Audit Committee of the Board. Pursuant to Section 10A(i)(3) of the Exchange Act and
related SEC rules, the Audit Committee has established procedures by which the Chairman of the Audit Committee may pre-approve such services
provided that the pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services to be rendered and the Chairman reports
the details of the services to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
The
audit committee has considered the services provided by Marcum, Salberg and Cherry Bekaert as disclosed above in the captions “audit
fees” and has concluded that such services are compatible with the independence of Marcum, Salberg and Cherry Bekaert as our principal
accountants for the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Our
Board has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for
activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors’ independence.
