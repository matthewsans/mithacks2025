Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Explanatory Note
Prior to the Separation (defined below), Lionsgate Studios Corp. (formerly trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol LION) (“Legacy Lionsgate Studios”) was a subsidiary of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (formerly trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols LGF.A and LGF.B) (“Old Lionsgate Parent”), and included the company’s motion picture and television studio operations (collectively referred to as the “Studio Business”).

As a result, (1) a new Lionsgate Studios Corp.

These engagements provide valuable insights that help shape our governance practices, refine our strategic direction, and enhance the quality and relevance of our public disclosures. Feedback received from shareholders is regularly communicated to our Board of Directors and relevant committees, ensuring that investor perspectives are meaningfully incorporated into the oversight and decision-making processes of the Company.

Key Features of Our Executive Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program aligns the interests of the Named Executive Officers with the Company’s long-term strategic direction and the interests of our shareholders. Key features of our program include:
•
Market-Competitive Pay – compensation decisions are informed by peer group and industry benchmarks.
•
Performance-Based Compensation – a significant portion of executive pay is “at risk,” with annual incentives and long-term equity awards tied to performance.
•
Balanced Structure – the program includes a mix of fixed salary, short-term incentives and long-term variable compensation.
21
Table of Contents
•
Committee Discretion – the Compensation Committee retains certain discretion in assessing performance and determining payouts under the annual incentive plan and performance-based equity awards.
•
Limited Perquisites – benefits and perquisites are modest and aligned with market practices.
We maintain employment agreements with Named Executive Officers to promote management stability while adhering to best practices generally favored by shareholders. These agreements:
•
Exclude “single-trigger” provisions, meaning equity awards and other benefits do not automatically accelerate upon a change in control.
•
Do not provide tax gross-ups on excess parachute payments.
•
Allow severance in connection with a change in control only in cases of involuntary terminations or “good reason” terminations, which we consider constructive terminations of employment.
Equity awards for Named Executive Officers are generally determined as part of new or amended employment agreements, specifying the value of grants to be made annually over the term, with the Compensation Committee having discretion to determine the type and terms of such grants each year. While the Company does not typically issue equity grants outside this framework, it may award annual bonuses in cash and/or equity and retains discretion to grant equity awards in other circumstances as deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee.
Program Objectives
The Company’s executive compensation program is designed to drive long-term shareholder value by attracting, motivating, and retaining top senior talent. The Compensation Committee structures the program to reward sustained financial and operational performance, align executive interests with shareholders, and promote long-term leadership stability. A substantial portion of executive compensation is performance-based, with annual and long-term incentives awarded only when performance targets are met.
Compensation Practices
What We Do
What We Don’t Do
✓  Pay for Performance: A significant majority of our executives’ target compensation is “at risk” in the form of annual and long-term incentive awards tied to pre-established performance goals aligned with our short- and long-term objectives and/or the value of our stock price.
×   No Tax Gross-ups: We do not provide tax reimbursements or gross-ups on severance or change-in-control payments.
✓  Use Performance Metrics: Our annual bonus and long-term incentive programs incorporate individual, group, and company-wide financial and operational performance measures.
×   No Pension Plans or Special Retirement Programs for Executive Officers: We do not offer defined benefit pension plan or supplemental retirement plan for executives.
✓  Risk Mitigation: Our compensation program has provisions to mitigate undue risk, including caps on the maximum level of payouts, a clawback policy, multiple performance metrics and board and management processes to identify risk.
×   No Single-Trigger Change in Control Agreements: We do not provide benefits triggered solely by a change in control.
✓  Review of Share Utilization: The Compensation Committee evaluates share utilization levels by reviewing the cost and dilutive impact of stock compensation.
×   No Hedging: Executives and directors are prohibited from hedging transactions on Company stock.

✓  Independent Compensation Consultant: The Compensation Committee engages Pay Governance, an independent consultant, for executive and director compensation guidance.
×   No Buyout of Underwater Stock Options or SARs: Underwater stock options and SARs cannot be bought out for cash without shareholder approval.
✓  Limit Perquisites: We limit perquisites to items that we believe serve a reasonable business purpose.

Process for Determining Executive Compensation
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Company’s executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee, which operates pursuant to a written charter. The Compensation Committee, working with management, determines and implements the Company’s executive compensation philosophy, structure, policies and programs, and administers the Company’s compensation and benefit plans. The Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible for determining the compensation arrangements for the Company’s executive officers and reports to the Board on all compensation matters regarding our executives and other key salaried employees.
Role of Management
The Compensation Committee reviews management-provided information in order to help align the executive compensation program with the Company’s business strategies and objectives. At various times during fiscal 2025, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and other executives attended relevant portions of Compensation Committee meetings to discuss the Company’s strategic objectives and financial performance relevant to the Compensation Committee’s decisions. Generally, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer recommends to the Compensation Committee compensation terms for other executives, considering market data, the Company’s strategy, individual performance and experience. The Compensation Committee reviews these recommendations with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and either approves or adjusts these recommendations. The Compensation Committee is solely responsible for determining the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Vice Chair. No Named Executive Officers participate in decisions regarding their own compensation.
Role of Compensation Consultant
Throughout fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance as its independent compensation consultant to assist in reviewing and determining the Company’s executive compensation program. Pay Governance provides guidance on compensation policies, practices and decisions, reporting directly to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain, terminate and approve the consultant’s fees and terms of engagement.
23
Table of Contents
Consultant Independence
During fiscal 2025, Pay Governance did not perform work for the Company other than pursuant to its engagement by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance and concluded that its engagement of Pay Governance does not raise any conflict of interest with the Company or any of its directors or executive officers.
Peer Group Analysis
The Compensation Committee utilizes a peer group to benchmark executive compensation against that of similarly positioned executives at other companies engaged in film production, television programming, digital content creation and live entertainment, in order to help ensure that the Company’s compensation packages are competitive with the broader market and aligned with shareholder interests.
In fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance to determine a post-Separation peer group for the Company. Pay Governance identified a pool of companies spanning entertainment, cable, streaming, and adjacent industries, which selection was then refined to exclude entities with disproportionately large revenues and to prioritize companies engaged in content creation and distribution. Pay Governance also considered companies referenced by shareholder advisory firms in prior reports, assessed “peer-to-peer” relationships (where multiple peers cited the same entities), and examined “reverse peer” companies (those that had designated the Company as a peer).
Based on this review, Pay Governance recommended a peer group consisting of the following ten companies:
Peer Group
AMC Networks Inc.
Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp.
Electronic Arts Inc.
Nexstar Media Group, Inc.
Fox Corporation
Sirius XM Holdings Inc.
Hasbro, Inc.
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.
Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.
Finally, consistent with past practice, Pay Governance also recommended that the Company continue to utilize entertainment industry-specific compensation survey data to benchmark roles that may not be reflected within the Company’s peer group. The participants in this survey include the following:
Entertainment Industry Group
ABC
NBCUniversal
Amazon Studios
Netflix
AMC Networks
Paramount/Showtime
Apple TV
Sony Pictures Entertainment
ESPN
Walt Disney Studios
Mattel
Warner Bros. Discovery
Use of Market Data
Utilizing peer group and industry survey market data, the Compensation Committee evaluates the amount and proportions of base salary, annual incentive pay, and long-term compensation, including target total direct compensation (defined as base salary, target annual bonus, and the grant date fair value of equity awards granted to the executive during the fiscal year) for select executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, relative to the compensation of similarly situated executives with these companies.
While this data serves as informative background for compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee doesn’t strictly benchmark compensation against any particular level relative to the Company’s peer group.
24
Table of Contents
Except as otherwise noted in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, decisions by the Compensation Committee are qualitative, reflecting the Compensation Committee’s business judgment, which is informed by analysis of the members of the Compensation Committee including input from, and data provided by, Pay Governance. The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation opportunities provided to the Named Executive Officers are appropriate in light of competitive considerations, and will modify its programs as appropriate based on ongoing industry trends and the Company’s competitive landscape.
Employment Agreements
We have entered into employment agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers. The terms of each employment agreement are described below under Description of Employment Agreements. Below is a discussion of new employment agreements we entered into with Mr. Feltheimer during fiscal 2025 and with Mr. Burns early in fiscal 2026, as well as an amendment to Mr. Tobey’s agreement early in fiscal 2026. We believe that it is in the best interests of the Company to enter into multiyear employment agreements with the Named Executive Officers as such multiyear agreements are typical in the Company’s industry and assist in retention and recruiting efforts, foster long-term retention, and promote stability among the management team, while still allowing the Compensation Committee to exercise considerable discretion in designing incentive compensation programs and rewarding performance.
Jon Feltheimer
In fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance to assist the committee in structuring and analyzing terms for a new employment agreement with Mr. Feltheimer, including a proposed increase to his target bonus and annual long-term equity awards. Pay Governance provided an analysis of the proposed compensation structure using compensation levels for Chief Executive Officers in the Company’s then-current peer group, noting that Mr. Feltheimer’s potential target total direct compensation would be positioned between the 27th and 65th percentiles of such group, depending on the grant date value of long-term incentive equity awards.
Accordingly, in August 2024, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Feltheimer to continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for a term ending July 31, 2029. The new employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and an annual performance bonus based on performance criteria as established by the Compensation Committee, with the target bonus commencing with the Company’s 2025 fiscal year being $7,500,000 and the maximum bonus being 200% of the target amount. Additionally, Mr. Feltheimer will be eligible to receive annual equity awards for the Company’s fiscal years 2026 through 2029 with a target annual grant date value of $10,000,000 (with the actual value to be determined based on the Company’s financial performance for the prior fiscal year against performance targets to be agreed upon by Mr. Feltheimer and the Compensation Committee early in the applicable fiscal year).
The terms of the agreement were established by the Compensation Committee based on its qualitative assessment of Mr. Feltheimer performance, negotiations with Mr. Feltheimer, and taking into account market data provided by Pay Governance. The agreement generally provides that Mr. Feltheimer’s long-term incentive awards (consisting of annual equity awards to be granted during the remaining four-year term of the agreement) would be granted 66% in the form of restricted share units (one-half of which would be subject to time-based vesting and one-half of which would be subject to performance-based vesting) and 34% in the form of stock options (with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant), although the Compensation Committee has discretion to change this structure each year. Each of the performance-based awards would vest as to one-third of the shares subject to such award on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the applicable grant date, subject to the achievement of performance criteria approved by the Compensation Committee in consultation with Mr. Feltheimer for the 12-month period ending on the applicable vesting date. For more information on this agreement, see the Description of Employment Agreements and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control sections below.

Table of Contents
Michael Burns
On May 6, 2025, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Michael Burns (the “Burns Employment Agreement”), the terms of which were negotiated with Mr. Burns. The term of the Burns Employment Agreement commenced on May 6, 2025 and will end on the third anniversary of such date (the “Burns Expiration Date”). The Burns Employment Agreement provides for Mr. Burns to receive an annual base salary of $500,000 and to be eligible for a discretionary annual bonus to be determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The Burns Employment Agreement also provides for Mr. Burns to participate in the Company’s usual benefit programs for executives at his level, as well as Company-provided life and disability insurance coverage, a car allowance and limited use of the Company’s private aircraft. Pursuant to the Burns Employment Agreement, Mr. Burns will also receive, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee and Mr. Burns’ continued employment through the applicable grant date, a grant of equity-based awards each year during the term of the Burns Employment Agreement, with each annual grant to have an aggregate value of $500,000. Unless otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, each annual grant will be in the form of performance-based restricted share units, with the number of performance-based restricted share units subject to the award determined by dividing $500,000 by the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the grant date. The annual grants will generally be scheduled to vest in three annual installments, with the vesting of the performance-based restricted share units to be contingent on achievement of performance metrics to be determined by the Compensation Committee in consultation with Mr. Feltheimer for the 12-month period ending on the applicable vesting date. The Burns Employment Agreement also provides that the annual grants may be settled in cash, shares, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee.
In the event Mr. Burns’ employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by him for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Burns Employment Agreement), he would be entitled to a cash severance payment equal to the present value of his base salary through the Burns Expiration Date, a cash payment equal to two times his base salary (in lieu of any bonus component), and payment by the Company of his premiums for continued health insurance coverage for up to 18 months following his termination date and for continued life and disability insurance coverage through the Burns Expiration Date. If Mr. Burns’ employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by him for good reason and such termination occurs on or within 12 months following a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Burns Employment Agreement), he would be entitled to the severance benefits described above, except that his cash severance would be the greater of the present value of his base salary through the Burns Expiration Date and $2.6 million. In the event that Mr. Burns’ employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause, by him for good reason, or due to his death or disability, his equity awards granted by the Company pursuant to the Burns Employment Agreement, to the extent then outstanding and unvested, would become fully vested upon his termination (and, in the case of a termination without cause or for good reason, if the annual grant for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs has not previously been granted, that annual grant would be made and would fully vest upon his termination). Mr. Burns’ right to receive the severance payments, accelerated vesting, and other severance benefits described above is subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company.
Additionally, on May 6, 2025, Starz entered into an advisory services agreement with Mr. Burns, wherein Mr. Burns was engaged as an independent contractor to act as a senior advisor to the Chief Executive Officer of Starz, providing strategic guidance to the Chief Executive Officer, with a primary focus on corporate finance, mergers, acquisitions, and related deal structuring transactions
Bruce Tobey
In fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance to assist the committee in structuring and analyzing terms for an extension of Mr. Tobey’s employment agreement, including a proposed increase to his target bonus, target annual incentive bonus and annual long-term equity awards. Pay Governance provided an analysis of the proposed compensation structure utilizing compensation levels for top legal executives among studios and the Company’s then-current peer group, noting that Mr. Tobey’s potential target total direct compensation would be positioned at around the 34th percentile of the peer group).
26
Table of Contents
Accordingly, on April 9, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment to the Company’s employment agreement with Mr. Tobey, to extend the term of the agreement by two years through March 31, 2028 and approve certain changes in his compensation. Pursuant to the amendment, effective as of April 1, 2025, Mr. Tobey will receive an annual base salary of $1,200,000, and his target annual bonus will be 85% of his base salary, with the amount of the bonus to be determined at the discretion of the Committee in consultation with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Tobey will also continue to be eligible for annual equity awards pursuant to the agreement, with the aggregate grant date value of each annual Grant to be $1,200,000, effective as of April 1, 2025, subject in each case to approval by the Compensation Committee and Mr. Tobey’s continued employment through the applicable grant date, with each annual grant to have the aggregate grant date value indicated above and to consist of restricted share units and/or stock options (or stock appreciation rights) as determined by the Compensation Committee. The awards that comprise each annual grant will generally have a three-year vesting period, subject to such time-based and performance-based vesting requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares subject to each of the awards comprising an annual grant will be determined, in the case of restricted share units awards, by dividing the dollar value allocated to the award by the closing price of the Company’s shares on the grant date and, in the case of options and similar awards, by dividing the dollar value allocated to the award by the per-share value of the award as of the grant date based on the methodology then used by the Company to value options and similar awards for financial statement purposes. The agreement provides that annual grants in the form of restricted share units may be settled in cash, shares, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee. In addition to the compensation described above, the agreement provides for Mr. Tobey to participate in the Company’s benefit programs and perquisites for executives at his level, as those arrangements are in place from time to time. Additionally, upon execution of the agreement, Mr. Tobey was granted 69,638 time-based restricted share units with a three-year vesting period.
The severance provisions of Mr. Tobey’s agreement were not changed by the amendment and are described in the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section below.
Compensation Components
The Company’s executive compensation program is generally based on three principal components:
(1)
Base salary;
(2)
Annual incentive bonuses; and
(3)
Long-term incentive awards that are subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting.
The Company also provides certain perquisites and personal benefits to the Named Executive Officers pursuant to their employment agreements, and severance benefits if the Named Executive Officer’s employment terminates under certain circumstances. In structuring executive compensation packages, the Compensation Committee considers how each component of compensation promotes retention and/or motivates performance by the executive.
Base Salary
We provide executive officers and employees with an annual base salary as part of their fixed compensation. This approach is designed to attract and retain highly qualified executives by ensuring certain predictable compensation levels that reward their continued service. Base salaries are determined at the time of hire or when we enter into an employment agreement, considering market data, peer group and entertainment industry compensation benchmarks, and individual performance. We typically set base salaries below industry peers, with the majority of compensation focused on performance-based incentives and stock-based awards.
27
Table of Contents
The current base salaries of Named Executive Officers are set forth below under Description of Employment Agreements (or, in the case of Messrs. Burns and Tobey, in the description of their employment agreements above). The Compensation Committee believes that the base salary levels of each of the Named Executive Officers are reasonable in view of the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s peer group data for similar positions and the committee’s assessment of the Company’s overall performance and contribution of those officers to that performance.
Annual Incentive Bonuses
Annual incentive bonuses are designed to motivate executive officers to achieve key financial, operational and individual performance goals that align with the Company’s broader business strategy. Employment agreements with Named Executive Officers typically provide for a target annual incentive bonus amount, with the amount awarded each year determined at the Compensation Committee’s discretion, taking into account the recommendation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (other than for himself and the Vice Chair), based on performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee.
Annual incentive awards are governed by a structured, performance-based process designed to align executive compensation with both Company-wide and individual results.
Fiscal Budget and Plan: At the beginning of each fiscal year, an estimated incentive award pool is incorporated into the Company’s annual fiscal budget and plan. This pool reflects aggregate target bonus opportunities available for all eligible employees for such fiscal year, as outlined in their respective employment arrangements.
Funding: The incentive pool is funded—partially or fully—based on the Company’s actual financial performance for that fiscal year. No individual awards are granted unless the pool is funded to some extent.
Allocation: If funding occurs, individual bonus awards are drawn from the available pool. Awards may be pro-rated if the pool is only partially funded.
Performance: Individual bonus awards are determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion using a framework that evaluates performance across two equally weighted categories:
•
Corporate performance (50%): Assesses the Company’s overall financial and operational results, including key performance indicators tied to the Company’s strategic objectives and long-term success.
•
Divisional performance (50%): Assesses results achieved within each operating segment, focusing on financial performance, operational execution, and strategic goal attainment. For the Named Executive Officers, who typically have broad responsibilities across the organization, divisional performance is evaluated in the context of overall Company performance rather than individual business units.
Discretionary Individual Adjustments: While corporate and divisional performance provide the foundation for determining incentive awards, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to consider individual performance and other qualitative factors when finalizing bonus amounts. This discretionary authority enables the committee to make thoughtful adjustments that recognize exceptional contributions, address circumstances not fully reflected in financial results, or account for broader considerations such as an executive’s role, tenure, historical and expected future performance, experience, changes in responsibility, internal equity and retention needs. Discretionary adjustments may be applied in cases where: activities that are accretive or transformative in nature, and expected to enhance and drive long-term value creation, may not be reflected in near-term financial metrics; investments in new businesses or increased investment in current lines of business may position the Company for future growth, despite temporarily impacting short-term performance metrics; and factors outside of management’s control, such as unplanned acquisitions or divestitures, unanticipated programming or business

Table of Contents
development opportunities, corporate transactions, material legal matters, or other unforeseen events are not accounted for at the beginning of the fiscal year. By incorporating discretion in this manner, the Compensation Committee ensures that incentive awards remain aligned with both actual performance and the Company’s long-term strategic objectives.
Determination: The final bonus award is determined by applying the average of the executive’s corporate and divisional performance scores to their target bonus amount, subject to the available funds in the bonus pool. The Compensation Committee may then apply discretionary adjustment—upward or downward—to this calculated amount, based on individual performance. This framework is intentionally designed to align executive compensation with both enterprise-wide and individual accomplishments, while maintaining fiscal discipline and ensuring that payouts are closely tied to overall performance outcomes.
Fiscal 2025 Annual Incentive Bonus Targets
Annual incentive bonus target amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers are set as a dollar amount or percentage of base salary, as set forth in their employment agreements.

Fiscal 2025 Annual Incentive Bonus Pool
Funding
To determine funding of the annual incentive bonus pool for fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee selected adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of the Company’s financial performance. This metric was chosen because it serves as a key performance indicator aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and long-term success, and is used internally to manage and assess financial performance.
Fiscal 2025 Actual
Fiscal 2025 Plan
Percent of 2025Actual vs. 2025 Plan
Adjusted OIBDA
$448.1 million
$528.8 million
~85%
While actual adjusted OIBDA for fiscal 2025 reached approximately 85% of plan, the Compensation Committee approved funding of only 75% of the proposed annual incentive bonus pool. This downward adjustment reflects the Committee’s view that underperformance in the Studio segment, despite a stronger fiscal 2025 fourth quarter in the Motion Picture segment and consolidated earnings approaching target, warranted a more conservative funding level. The Studio segment’s shortfall had a disproportionate impact on overall financial performance and was a key consideration in the Committee’s decision to moderate the bonus pool funding accordingly.
Corporate Performance
To determine the Company’s corporate performance measure for fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee again selected adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure for evaluating the Company’s financial performance for fiscal 2025. Again, even though actual adjusted OIBDA for fiscal 2025 reached approximately 85% of plan, the
31
Table of Contents
Compensation Committee approved a payout of 75% for the corporate performance measure of each executive’s bonus. This downward adjustment reflects the Committee’s recognition of the Company’s stock price and the underperformance in the Studio segment, an area of strategic and financial significance, which together warranted a more measured payout.
Divisional Performance
To determine divisional performance measures for fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee reviewed each division’s fiscal 2025 financial performance using segment profit as the principal performance metric.

Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined to award the following divisional performance measures for fiscal 2025:
•
90% as the divisional performance measure for the Motion Picture segment;
•
65% as the divisional performance measure for the Television Production segment; and
•
95% as the divisional performance measure for the Media Networks segment.
In reviewing divisional performance for the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee evaluated overall Company performance rather than focusing on any particular division.
Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that each Named Executive Officer would be awarded 75% for divisional performance.

The Compensation Committee, however, then reviewed Mr. Feltheimer’s achievements relative to individual performance goals established at the outset of the fiscal year, to determine whether to exercise discretion to adjust the preliminary bonus amount. The Committee noted the following key contributions:
•
Separation Execution and Governance Leadership: Orchestrated the successful separation of the Studios Business and Starz Business into two independent, publicly traded entities in May 2025,
32
Table of Contents
including support for the collapse of Old Lionsgate Parent’s dual-class share structure into a single class and creation of separate capital structures, independent boards of directors, and establishment of new corporate governance frameworks for Lionsgate and Starz.
•
Deliver Record Library Performance. In a challenging environment, led Lionsgate to achieve record library performance with trailing 12-month revenue of $956 million (up 8% relative to fiscal 2024 fourth quarter trailing 12-month library revenue) driven by a best-ever fiscal 2025 fourth quarter through a combination of organic replenishment, distribution of third-party titles, library acquisitions and the rollout of new proprietary FAST and AVOD channels.
•
Content Strategy and Growth Opportunities: Advanced a robust slate of theatrical releases (including The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, The Long Walk, Good Fortune, Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, The Housemaid, The Resurrection of the Christ, Michael, Caine, and the re-imagining of Blair Witch) to replenish the theatrical content pipeline for fiscal 2026, while positioning the studio for accelerated growth and enhanced financial performance in fiscal 2027. In television, in addition to the critical success of The Studio and Ghosts, continuing to strengthen the television portfolio with premium properties such as Spartacus: House of Ashur, The Rainmaker and Robin Hood, while advancing development on high-profile IP such as the Twilight television adaptation Midnight Sun, the John Wick: Under the High Table series and a television adaptation of Bad Moms.
•
Motion Picture Financial Performance and Operational Efficiency: Lionsgate’s Motion Picture segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 grew 28%, while segment profit grew 65%, driven by box office success of mid-budget films, an increase in non-theatrical content deliveries, strong library demand and lower print and advertising spend.
•
Prepared Starz for Separation: At Starz, ended the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter with 12.3 million U.S. over-the-top subscribers, representing sequential growth of 530,000 subscribers (with total U.S. subscribers reaching 18.0 million, an increase of 320,000 from the prior quarter).
The Compensation Committee also engaged Pay Governance to assist it in assessing the fiscal 2025 bonus amount for Mr. Feltheimer. Pay Governance reviewed, among other things, the achievements noted above, other highlights of the Company’s business and strategic performance achieved during fiscal 2025, and the competitive position of Mr. Feltheimer’s total direct compensation (defined as base salary, actual annual bonus, and the grant date fair value of equity awards granted to the executive during the fiscal year) relative to similar positions within the Company’s peer group.
Accordingly, based on this analysis and in recognition of the scope and impact of Mr. Feltheimer’s individual contributions, the Compensation Committee approved for fiscal 2025 a bonus of $6,500,000 (adjusted upward from the preliminary bonus amount, but below target), consisting of $1,200,00 in cash and a time-based award of 662,500 restricted share units (based on an $8 share price, above the then-current trading price of the Company’s common shares, and vesting over one year). The Compensation Committee allocated over 80% of Mr. Feltheimer’s bonus to this time-based equity award in order to further align Mr. Feltheimer’s interests with those of shareholders and reinforce long-term value creation.

Table of Contents
reviewed Mr. Burns’ achievements relative to individual performance goals established at the outset of the fiscal year, to determine whether to exercise discretion to adjust the preliminary bonus amount. The Committee noted the following key contributions:
•
Separation Strategy and Execution: Played a central leadership role in the multi-year effort to separate Lionsgate and Starz into two independent, publicly traded entities, commencing with the close of the business combination of the Studios Business with Screaming Eagle Acquisition Corp. and launch of Legacy Lionsgate Studios in May 2024, and ending with the Separation of the Studios Business and Starz Business into two independent, publicly traded entities in May 2025. Served as a driving force behind the transaction’s conception and execution, which included an equity raise from institutional investors in May 2024, creation of separate capital structures for Lionsgate and Starz, the collapse of Old Lionsgate Parent’s dual-class share structure into a single class, and ultimately, helping secure overwhelming shareholder approval for the Separation.
•
Capital Markets and Financial Strategy: Worked closely with the Company’s executive team to supervise all capital markets activity, with a focus on reducing net debt and lowering the Company’s cost of capital. Leveraged long-standing banking relationships to support financing efforts and strengthen the balance sheets of both Lionsgate and Starz.
•
M&A and Franchise Development: Contributed to the successful acquisition and integration of eOne Entertainment and played a key role in franchise expansion and monetization strategies, including the development of new projects tied to franchise properties.
•
Stakeholder Maintained and expanded high-level relationships with institutional investors, rating agencies and strategic partners.
•
Talent Engagement: Leveraged relationships with top-tier talent and creators to secure new content deals and franchise extensions across platforms.
•
AI Innovation: Spearheaded groundbreaking partnership with Runway, marking the first collaboration between a Hollywood studio and the leading applied AI research company to develop a custom AI model trained on Lionsgate’s proprietary film and television content.
The Compensation Committee also engaged Pay Governance to assist it in assessing the fiscal 2025 bonus amount for Mr. Burns. Pay Governance reviewed, among other things, the achievements noted above, other highlights of the Company’s business and strategic performance achieved during fiscal 2025, and the competitive position of Mr. Burns’ total direct compensation relative to similar positions within the Company’s peer group.
Accordingly, based on this analysis and in recognition of the scope and impact of Mr. Burns’ individual contributions, the Compensation Committee approved for fiscal 2025 a bonus of $4,500,000 (adjusted upward from the preliminary bonus amount, but below target), consisting of $3,500,000 in cash and a time-based award of 125,000 restricted share units (valued at an $8 share price, above the then-current trading price of the Company’s common shares, and vesting over one year). The Compensation Committee determined that allocating a substantial portion of Mr. Burns’ bonus in cash was appropriate in light of Mr. Burns’ leadership in the strategic execution of the Separation — a unique, non-recurring, complex and transformative transaction requiring sustained engagement, stakeholder coordination, and long-term vision. In contrast, the time-based equity award, vesting over one year, further aligns Mr. Burns’s interests with those of shareholders, reinforces long-term value creation, and reflects his ongoing contributions to the Company’s strategic direction and governance.

The Compensation Committee approved a bonus for Mr. Tobey above target and determined that allocating half of Mr. Tobey’s bonus in cash was warranted in recognition of Mr. Tobey’s central role in the legal execution of the Separation — a unique, non-recurring, complex and transformative transaction that demanded sustained leadership, technical expertise, and coordination across multiple jurisdictions and counterparties. In contrast, the equity award, which is time-based and vests over one year, is intended to further align Mr. Tobey’s interests with those of shareholders, reward continued service, and reflect the importance of maintaining steady legal and strategic guidance across the Company’s operations.
Long-term Incentive Awards
The Company believes that providing a meaningful equity stake in our business is essential to ensure competitive compensation and aligning executives’ incentives with shareholders’ interests, driving long-term performance. To this end, we have historically made grants of restricted share units, stock options and/or SARs to incentivize executives in driving shareholder value. The Compensation Committee determines these grants based on factors such as:
•
The executive’s role and overall compensation package;
•
The executive’s performance in fulfilling individual responsibilities;
•
Comparative analysis of equity participation among executives at peer group companies; and
•
The executive’s contribution to the Company’s financial success.
Equity Award Grant Practices
Equity award grants to the Named Executive Officers are set forth in their employment agreements, which generally provide terms for annual grants to be made over the agreement’s term. The Compensation Committee assesses the award terms each year and makes a final determination as to the types and terms of equity awards to be granted to the Named Executive Officers for that year. The number of shares subject to restricted share unit awards is generally determined by dividing the applicable grant date value provided in the employment agreement by the closing price on the grant date, and the number of shares subject to awards of stock options and SARs is generally determined by dividing the applicable grant date value provided in the employment agreement by the per-share fair value of the award on the grant date based on the valuation method and assumptions then generally used by the Company in valuing its options and SARs for financial statement purposes.
The Compensation Committee’s practice has been to grant annual equity awards at its first meeting after July 1 each year. Additionally, the Company may, from time-to-time, grant equity-based awards to executive officers
38
Table of Contents
and other employees as part of annual bonuses, in connection with new-hires or promotions, or in other special circumstances, and retains discretion to grant equity awards from time-to-time when and as the Compensation Committee may determine to be appropriate. The release of material non-public information is not taken into account in determining the timing and terms of equity award grants, and the Company does not time the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Prior to the Separation, Old Lionsgate Parent’s equity incentive awards, as described below, were generally made with respect to Class B non-voting shares. However, the Compensation Committee had discretion to provide that awards granted under stock incentive plans to be made with respect to the Class A voting shares rather than the Class B non-voting shares. The discussion below refers to the classes of Old Lionsgate Parent shares that were subject to grants made prior to the Separation. After the Separation, the Company has one class of common shares, and the Company’s equity incentive awards will be made with respect to those common shares.
Restricted Share Units
The Company grants long-term incentive awards to the Named Executive Officers in the form of restricted share units that may be subject to time-based and performance-based vesting requirements. These awards generally relate to Class B non-voting shares, with each unit that vests payable in Class B non-voting shares (although awards may also be structured to be payable in cash based on the value of the underlying shares). Awards of time-based restricted share units vest over a period of several years following the date of grant, aligning executives’ interests with shareholders and promoting retention by maintaining value regardless of share price fluctuations.   Awards of performance-based restricted share units also cover multiple years, with portions eligible to vest annually based on Company and individual performance relative to goals set by the Compensation Committee. Before any performance-based restricted share unit is paid, the Compensation Committee must certify that the performance target(s) have been satisfied. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the performance target(s) and any other restrictions or other limitations of performance-based restricted share units and may reserve discretion to reduce payments below maximum award limits, enabling these awards to drive annual performance while reinforcing long-term retention. In no event will the award vest as to more than 100% of the shares subject to the award.
Stock Options
A stock option is the right to purchase shares at a future date at a specified price per share. The Company grants stock options to the Named Executive Officers with an exercise price that is equal to (i) the closing price of a Class B non-voting share on the date of grant, and (ii) in certain cases, as a percentage premium to the closing price of a Class B non-voting share on the date of grant. Thus, the Named Executive Officers will realize value on their stock options only if the Company’s shareholders realize value on their shares and, for that reason, the Compensation Committee considers all options to be performance-based awards. The stock options function as a retention incentive for the Company’s executives as the executive generally must remain employed through the vesting period. The maximum term of a stock option is 10 years from the date of grant.
Share Appreciation Rights
A share appreciation right (or SAR) is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a Class B non-voting share on the date of exercise of the SAR over the base price of the SAR. The Company has made a portion of its long- term incentive awards to the Named Executive Officers in the form of SARs. Upon exercise of a SAR, the holder receives a payment in cash or shares with a value equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a Class B non-voting share on the date of exercise of the SAR over the base price of the SAR. Because the base price of the SAR is not less than the closing price of a Class B non-voting share on the
39
Table of Contents
grant date, SARs provide the same incentives as stock options because the holder will realize value on their SARs only if the Company’s share price increases after the date of grant. Thus, similar to stock options, SARs are considered by the Compensation Committee to be performance-based awards. The SARs function as a retention incentive for the Company’s executives as the executive generally must remain employed through the vesting period. The maximum term of a SAR is 10 years from the date of grant.
Granting of Equity Awards in Fiscal 2025
The following equity awards were granted to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2025.
These awards consist of annual grants made to Messrs. Feltheimer, Burns, Barge, Goldsmith and Tobey pursuant to their employment agreements. In addition, these awards consist of a portion of certain performance-based awards approved by the Compensation Committee prior to fiscal 2025 that became eligible to vest during fiscal 2025. In the case of these performance-based awards, the award (or a portion thereof) is treated as granted for accounting purposes on the date on which the Compensation Committee determines whether the applicable performance requirements have been met, and the discussion below relates to the vesting tranches of these awards allocated to fiscal 2025 (including the number of shares awarded by the Compensation Committee based on performance during fiscal 2025) or that were allocated to a performance period that ended during fiscal 2025. For more information on these awards, please see the executive compensation tables and narratives that follow this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
•
In August 2024, the Compensation Committee approved annual grants of restricted share units for fiscal 2025 (one-half of which would be subject to time-based vesting and one-half of which would be subject to performance-based vesting) to each of the Named Executive Officers. Each of these grants is scheduled to vest over a three-year period. The number of shares subject to the time-based grants are shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below. As noted above, the performance-based awards are not treated as granted for accounting purposes until the Compensation Committee determines whether the applicable performance requirements have been met, and accordingly, the annual grants made in fiscal 2025 that are subject to performance-based vesting are not reflected in the table.
•
In July 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the vesting of a tranche of awards of performance-based restricted share units granted to Messrs. Feltheimer, Barge and Goldsmith in July 2022, that were eligible to vest during fiscal 2025. The tranches covered 96,811, 54,456 and 56,473 restricted share units, respectively with respect to Class B non-voting shares, that were eligible to vest based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and the executive’s performance during the 12-month period covered by the tranche. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s corporate performance reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the contributions of Messrs. Feltheimer, Barge and Goldsmith cited in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement. Accordingly, based on its review, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of 100% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to these vesting tranches for Messrs. Feltheimer and Goldsmith, and 90% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to this vesting tranche for Mr. Barge, and these tranches are considered granted for accounting purposes upon the date of the Compensation Committee’s determination and are reported in the compensation tables below. However, these tranches of performance-based restricted share units do not vest unless a VWAP Goal (as defined below) is achieved on or before the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the award date or (ii) the date of termination of the executive’s employment or service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason. The “VWAP Goal” shall be considered achieved on the date on which the volume weighted average of the closing prices of Class B non-voting shares over a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on such date is equal to or greater than $14.61, in each case in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The VWAP Goal (if not previously achieved) is deemed to have been achieved in full upon any change in control of the Company, or any other extraordinary transaction
40

(including, but not limited to, a full or partial spin-off, split-off, issuance of a tracking stock or other transaction by the Company or its subsidiaries). In May 2024, the VWAP Goal was deemed to have been achieved.
•
In July 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the vesting of a tranche covering 199,840 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Feltheimer in July 2023 that was eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and Mr. Feltheimer’s performance during the 12-month period covered by that tranche. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s corporate performance reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, and the contributions of Mr. Feltheimer cited in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement. Accordingly, based on its review, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of 100% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to this vesting tranche.
•
In July 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the vesting of a tranche covering 69.944 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Burns in July 2023 that was eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and Mr. Burns’ performance during the 12-month period covered by that tranche. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s corporate performance reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, and the contributions of Mr. Burns cited in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement. Accordingly, based on its review, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of 100% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to this vesting tranche.
•
In July 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the vesting of (i) a tranche covering 42,779 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Barge in July 2021 and (ii) a tranche covering 64,948 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Barge in July 2023, in each case, that were eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and Mr. Barge’s performance during the 12-month period covered by that tranche. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s corporate performance reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the contributions of Mr. Barge cited in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement. Accordingly, based on its review, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of 90% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to these vesting tranches.
•
In July 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the vesting of (i) a tranche covering 39,927 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Goldsmith in July 2021, and (ii) a tranche covering 69,944 shares of an award of performance-based restricted share units granted to Mr. Goldsmith in July 2023, in each case, that were eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of the Company’s and Mr. Goldsmith’s performance during the 12-month period covered by that tranche. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s corporate performance reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, and the contributions of Mr. Goldsmith cited in the Company’s 2024 proxy statement. Accordingly, based on its review, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of 100% of the performance-based restricted share units that were subject to these vesting tranches.

CEO Equity Award for Fiscal 2026
As noted above, Mr. Feltheimer’s employment agreement entered into in August 2024 provides that he will be eligible to receive annual equity awards for the Company’s fiscal years 2026 through 2029, with a target annual grant date value of $10,000,000 and with the actual value to be determined based on the Company’s financial performance for the prior fiscal year against performance targets to be agreed upon by Mr. Feltheimer and the Compensation Committee early in the applicable fiscal year. For his fiscal 2026 award, Mr. Feltheimer and the Compensation Committee agreed that the award value would be determined based on the Company’s year-over-year adjusted OIBDA growth and revenue growth achieved in fiscal 2025, with the award value ranging from $6,000,000 for threshold performance (defined as a rate of growth higher than -8.0% for either metric or higher than -10.0% for both metrics) to $14,000,000 for maximum performance (defined as a rate of growth higher than 10.0% for one metric and higher than 8.0% for the other metric). The Compensation Committee retained discretion to determine the final award value (including discretion to award a value of more than $14,000,000 if the maximum performance levels were exceeded and discretion to grant an award even if the threshold performance levels were not met). The Compensation Committee could also consider 3-year average growth in addition to year-over-year growth and would also make adjustments for any change in accounting policies, any material corporate transactions (and related costs), and any other extraordinary events occurring during the fiscal year.
Accordingly, in June 2025, the Compensation Committee approved an equity award for Mr. Feltheimer with a grant date value of $8,500,000, representing 85% of the target award. In making this decision, the Compensation Committee considered 3-year average growth and year-over-year growth of adjusted OIBDA and revenue, as well as significant corporate transactions occurring during the fiscal year (most notably, the Separation) to determine whether any adjustment was warranted. Ultimately, however, the Compensation Committee elected to apply the same adjusted OIBDA analysis used in assessing fiscal 2025 annual incentive bonuses, discussed above, without making any additional adjustment.
Severance and Other Benefits upon Termination of Employment
The Company provides severance protections for the Named Executive Officers under their respective employment agreements. The Compensation Committee determines the level of severance benefits on a case-by-case basis, and, in general, considers them an important part of an executive’s compensation, consistent with competitive practices and, particularly in the context of a change in control transaction, playing a valuable role in attracting and retaining key executive officers.
As described in more detail under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control below, the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to severance benefits under their employment agreements in the event of a termination of employment by the Company “without cause” or, in certain cases, for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the executive’s employment agreement. The Company has determined that it is appropriate to provide these executives with severance benefits under these circumstances in light of their positions with the Company and as part of their overall compensation package. The cash severance benefits for these executives are generally determined, in the case of Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns, based on their base salary through the remainder of the term covered by their employment agreement and, in the case of the other Named Executive Officers, the greater of 50% of their base salary through the remainder of the term covered by their employment agreement or their base salary for a specified number of months following termination.
The Company also believes that the occurrence, or potential occurrence, of a change in control transaction will create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of our executive officers. This uncertainty results from the fact that many change in control transactions result in significant organizational changes, particularly at the senior executive level. In order to encourage our executive officers to remain employed with the Company during an important time when their prospects for continued employment following the transaction are often uncertain, we provide certain Named Executive Officers with enhanced severance benefits if their employment is
42
Table of Contents
terminated by the Company “without cause” or, in certain cases, by the executive for “good reason” in connection with a change in control. We believe that such enhanced severance benefits the Company and the shareholders by incentivizing the executives to be receptive to potential transactions that are in the best interest of shareholders even if the executives face great personal uncertainty in the change in control context. The cash severance benefits for these executives are generally determined based on their base salary through the remainder of the term covered by their employment agreement (or, if greater, a specified amount in the case of Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns or a specified number of months of base salary following termination in the case of the other Named Executive Officers). In addition, the Company believes it is appropriate to provide these benefits to certain Named Executive Officers (other than Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns) if their employment is terminated in circumstances described above following a change in the senior management of the Company as specified in their respective employment agreements.
As noted above, we do not provide any benefits to the Named Executive Officers that would be payable solely because a change in control occurs or any right to receive a gross-up payment for any parachute payment taxes that may be imposed in connection with a change in control.
See Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control below for more information on the severance benefits provided under the Named Executive Officers’ employment agreements.
Perquisites and Other Benefits
We provide certain Named Executive Officers with limited perquisites and other personal benefits, such as life insurance policy contributions and club membership dues that the Compensation Committee believes are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program, to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. Additionally, we own an interest in an aircraft through a fractional ownership program for use, from time to time, for film promotion and other corporate purposes. As we maintain this interest for business purposes, we believe that it is reasonable to afford limited personal use of the aircraft consistent with regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC and the Federal Aviation Administration. Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns reimburse the Company for a portion of the costs incurred for their limited personal use of the aircraft. All of these perquisites are reflected in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table and the accompanying footnotes below.
We have also adopted a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to allow the Named Executive Officers and certain other key employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation without regard to the tax code limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans. The deferred compensation plan is intended to promote retention by providing participants with an opportunity to save for retirement in a tax-efficient manner. Please see the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation section below for a description of the plan.
Clawback Policy
In accordance with SEC and NYSE requirements, the Compensation Committee has adopted an executive compensation recovery policy regarding the adjustment or recovery of certain incentive awards or payments made to current or former executive officers in the event that we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. In general, the policy provides that, unless an exception applies, we will seek to recover compensation that is awarded to an executive officer based on the Company’s attainment of a financial metric during the three-year period prior to the fiscal year in which the restatement occurs, to the extent such compensation exceeds the amount that would have been awarded based on the restated financial results.
Policy with Respect to Section 162(m)
U.S. federal income tax law generally prohibits a publicly held company from deducting compensation paid to a current or former named executive officer that exceeds $1 million during the tax year. Certain awards granted
43
Table of Contents
before November 2, 2017, that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures that were set by the Compensation Committee under a plan approved by the Company’s shareholders, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1 million deductibility limit. As one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee notes this deductibility limitation. However, the Compensation Committee has the flexibility to take any compensation-related actions that it determines are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, including awarding compensation that may not be deductible for tax purposes. There can be no assurance that any compensation will in fact be deductible.
Company’s Compensation Policies and Risk Management
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the design and operation of the Company’s current compensation structures and policies as they pertain to risk and has determined that the Company’s compensation programs do not create or encourage the taking of risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Simm (Chair), Fries, Rachesky, Sloan and Ms. McCaw. No member who served on the Compensation Committee at any time during fiscal 2025 is or has been a former or current executive officer of the Company, or had any relationships requiring disclosure by the Company under the SEC’s rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related-party transactions. None of the Company’s executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2025.

As explained in note (1) below, these amounts include the value of equity awards granted early in fiscal 2023 as a portion of the executive’s fiscal 2022 annual incentive bonus as follows: for Mr. Feltheimer, $7,200,002 in stock awards; for Mr. Burns, $3,500,005 in stock awards; for Mr. Barge, $3,199,998 in stock awards; and for Mr. Goldsmith, $900,003 in stock awards.

In accordance with SEC rules, any portion of a Named Executive Officer’s annual bonus that the Compensation Committee determined would be paid in the form of an equity award is reported in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for the fiscal year in which the award was approved by the Compensation Committee (i.e., the year after the year in which the bonus was earned). For fiscal 2025, the bonus for each Named Executive’s Officer (other than Mr. Barge) was awarded partly in cash and partly in the form of equity-based awards with a one-year vesting schedule. Accordingly, the cash portion of each bonus awarded for fiscal 2025 performance was reported in the “Bonus” column in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal 2025, and the grant date fair value of the equity awards granted to each executive as part of their fiscal 2025 bonus will be reported as compensation for fiscal 2026 in the Summary Compensation Table in the Company’s 2026 annual proxy statement. For fiscal 2022, each Named Executive’s Officer’s bonus was awarded partly in cash and partly in the form of equity-based awards with a one-year vesting schedule. Accordingly, the cash portion of each bonus awarded for fiscal 2022 performance was reported in the “Bonus” column in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscals 2022 in prior years’ proxy statement, and the grant date fair
45
Table of Contents
value of the equity awards granted to each executive as part of their fiscal 2022 bonus is reported herein as compensation for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, each Named Executive’s Officer’s bonus was awarded in cash, and the full amount is reported in the “Bonus” column for those years.
(2)
The amounts reported in columns (e) and (f) reflect the fair value of these awards on the grant date as determined under the principles used to calculate the value of equity awards for purposes of the Company’s financial statements. The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form option valuation model (Black-Scholes). The fair value of a stock award is determined based on the market value of the stock award on the date of grant. Under SEC rules, the entire grant date value of these awards is reported as compensation for the Named Executive Officer for the fiscal year in which the award was granted. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above under Long-Term Incentive Awards, the Compensation Committee has approved certain grants of restricted share units to each of the Named Executive Officers that would vest based on such company and/or individual performance criteria determined by the Compensation Committee in consultation with Mr. Feltheimer for each of the 12-month performance periods covered by these awards (with a tranche of each award being allocated to each of the performance periods for that award). The grant date for accounting purposes for each portion of the award occurs at the end of the applicable performance period when it is determined whether the performance criteria applicable to that portion of the award have been met. Under SEC rules, the value of equity awards is reported as compensation for the fiscal year in which the grant date (as determined for accounting purposes) occurs. Accordingly, to the extent the Compensation Committee determined during a particular fiscal year the performance level achieved for a particular performance period under the award, the portion of the award that relates to that performance period is reported as compensation for the fiscal year in which the determination was made.

These awards were granted with respect to Class B non-voting shares.
(1)
The amounts reported in column (l) reflect the fair value of these awards on the grant date as determined under the principles used to calculate the value of equity awards for purposes of the Company’s financial statements. For a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to value the awards reported in column (l), see footnote (2) to the Summary Compensation Table.
Each of the equity-based awards reported in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table was granted under, and is subject to, the terms of the 2023 Plan. The 2023 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, which has authority to interpret the plan provisions and make all required determinations under the plan. This authority includes, subject to the provisions of the 2023 Plan, selecting participants and determining the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, determining the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award, accelerating or extending the vesting or exercisability or extending the term of any or all outstanding awards, making certain adjustments to an outstanding award and authorizing the conversion, succession or substitution of an award, determining the
49
Table of Contents
manner in which the purchase price of an award or the Company’s common shares may be paid, making required proportionate adjustments to outstanding awards upon the occurrence of certain corporate events such as reorganizations, mergers and stock splits, and making provisions to ensure that any tax withholding obligations incurred in respect of awards are satisfied. Awards granted under the plan are generally only transferable to a beneficiary of a Named Executive Officer upon his or her death or, in certain cases, to family members for tax or estate planning purposes
Under the terms of the 2023 Plan, a change in control of the Company does not automatically trigger vesting of the awards then outstanding under the plan. If there is a change in control, each participant’s outstanding awards granted under the plan will generally be assumed by the successor company, unless the Compensation Committee provides that the award will not be assumed and will become fully vested and, in the case of stock options, exercisable. Any stock options that become vested in connection with a change in control will generally terminate to the extent they are not exercised prior to the change in control.
As described below under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control, certain equity awards granted to the Named Executive Officers are subject to accelerated vesting under the terms of their respective employment agreements in the event of a termination of their employment under certain circumstances.
Restricted Share Units
Columns (g) and (i) in the table above report awards of restricted share units granted to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2025, including tranches of certain performance-based awards that are treated as granted during fiscal 2025 under applicable accounting rules. Each restricted share unit represents a contractual right to receive, upon vesting of the unit, payment equal to the value of Class B non-voting shares (typically in an equal number of Class B non-voting shares, but the Compensation Committee has the discretion to settle the units in cash or shares of Class A voting shares). The Named Executive Officer does not have the right to vote or dispose of the restricted share units, but will be credited with additional share units under the award as dividend equivalents based on the amount of dividends (if any) paid by the Company during the term of the award on a number of Class B non-voting shares equal to the number of outstanding and unpaid restricted share units then subject to the award. Such dividend equivalents will be paid only if and when vesting requirements applicable to the underlying share units are met.
Time-Based Units
For Messrs. Feltheimer, Burns, Barge, Goldsmith and Tobey, the awards of 535,264, 321,159, 200,724, 187,343 and 69,584 Class B non-voting shares, respectively, made in August 2024 and reported in column (i) in the table above, represent annual grants of time-based restricted share units. These awards are subject to a three-year vesting schedule, subject to the executive’s continued employment through the vesting dates.
Performance-Based Units
Column (g) in the table above reports awards of performance share units that are treated as granted to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2025 under applicable accounting rules. Performance share units are similar to the restricted share units described above, except that they are subject to performance based vesting conditions as well as time-based vesting.
For Messrs. Feltheimer, Barge and Goldsmith, the awards of 96,811, 54,456 and 56,473 Class B non-voting shares, respectively, made in July 2024, and reported in column (g) in the table above, represent the portion (100% for Messrs. Feltheimer and Goldsmith and 90% for Mr. Barge) of awards of restricted share units that vested with respect to performance only based on Messrs. Feltheimer’s, Barge’s, Goldsmith’s and the Company’s performance, respectively. These awards were originally approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2022, and cover a three-year period ending in July 2025, with one-third of the total award being eligible to vest
50
Table of Contents
based on Messrs. Feltheimer’s, Barge’s, Goldsmith’s and the Company’s respective performance over a specified 12-month period. Each grant is treated as three separate annual awards for accounting purposes and, in each case, is treated as granted for accounting purposes on the date the Compensation Committee determines the level of performance achieved for the particular performance period. Accordingly, only the units eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on Messrs. Feltheimer’s, Barge’s, Goldsmith’s and the Company’s respective performance are reflected in the table above. However, none of the performance-based restricted share units vest unless a VWAP Goal (as defined below) is achieved on or before the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the award date or (ii) the date of termination of the executive’s employment or service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any reason. The “VWAP Goal” shall be considered achieved on the date on which the volume weighted average of the closing prices of Class B non-voting shares over a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on such date is equal to or greater than $14.61, in each case in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The VWAP Goal (if not previously achieved) is deemed to have been achieved in full upon any change in control of the Company, or any other extraordinary transaction (including, but not limited to, a full or partial spin-off, split-off, issuance of a tracking stock or other transaction by the Company or its subsidiaries). In May 2024, the VWAP Goal was deemed to have been achieved.
For Mr. Feltheimer, the award of 199,840 Class B non-voting shares made in July 2024, and reported in column (g) in the table above, represents 100% of the portion of an award of restricted share units that vested based on Mr. Feltheimer’s and the Company’s performance. This award was originally approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2023 and covers a three-year period ending in July 2026, with one-third of the total award being eligible to vest based on Mr. Feltheimer’s and the Company’s performance over a specified 12-month period. This grant is treated as three separate annual awards for accounting purposes and, in each case, is treated as granted for accounting purposes on the date the Compensation Committee determines the level of performance achieved for the particular performance period. Accordingly, only the units eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on Mr. Feltheimer’s and the Company’s performance are reflected in the table above.
For Mr. Burns, the award of 69,944 Class B non-voting shares made in July 2024, and reported in column (g) in the table above, represents 100% of the portion of an award of restricted share units that vested based on Mr. Burns’ and the Company’s performance. This award was originally approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2023 and covers a three-year period ending in July 2026, with one-third of the total award being eligible to vest based on Mr. Burns’ and the Company’s performance over a specified 12-month period. This grant is treated as three separate annual awards for accounting purposes and, in each case, is treated as granted for accounting purposes on the date the Compensation Committee determines the level of performance achieved for the particular performance period. Accordingly, only the units eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on Mr. Burns’ and the Company’s performance are reflected in the table above.
For Mr. Barge, the award of 38,501 Class B non-voting shares made in July 2024, and reported in column (g) in the table above, represents 90% of the portion of an award of restricted share units that vested based on Mr. Barge’s and the Company’s performance. This award was originally approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2021 and covers a three-year period ending in July 2024, with one-third of the total award being eligible to vest based on Mr. Barge’s and the Company’s performance over a specified 12-month period. This grant is treated as three separate annual awards for accounting purposes and, in each case, is treated as granted for accounting purposes on the date the Compensation Committee determines the level of performance achieved for the particular performance period. Accordingly, only the units eligible to vest during fiscal 2025 based on Mr. Barge’s and the Company’s performance are reflected in the table above.
For Mr. Barge, the award of 58,453 Class B non-voting shares made in July 2024, and reported in column (g) in the table above, represents 90% of the portion of an award of restricted share units that vested based on Mr. Barge’s and the Company’s performance.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
We permit the Named Executive Officers and certain other key employees to elect to receive a portion of their compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table above on a deferred basis under our Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the plan, we are also permitted to make additional discretionary contributions with respect to amounts deferred under the plan.
For cash amounts deferred under the plan, the participant may elect one or more measurement funds to be used to determine investment gains or losses to be credited to his or her account balance, including certain mutual funds. Amounts may be deferred until a specified date, retirement or other termination of service, disability or death. At the participant’s election, compensation deferred until a specified date or termination of service may be paid as a lump sum or in annual installments as specified in the plan document. If the participant’s employment terminates due to death or disability, the participant’s deferred compensation balance will be paid in a single lump sum. Emergency hardship withdrawals are also permitted under the plan.
As of March 31, 2025, none of the Named Executive Officers had deferred any amount under the plan, and the Company had not made any contributions with respect to any Named Executive Officer under the plan.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following section describes the benefits that may become payable to the Named Executive Officers in connection with a termination of their employment with us pursuant to the terms of their respective employment
54
Table of Contents
agreements with the Company. In addition to the benefits described below, outstanding equity-based awards held by the Named Executive Officers may also be subject to accelerated vesting in connection with a change in control of the Company under the terms of our equity incentive plans if the awards are not assumed or otherwise continued upon the transaction, as noted under Grants of Plan-Based Awards above. None of the Named Executive Officers are entitled to any reimbursement or gross-up payment for any excise taxes imposed under Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Named Executive Officers also do not have a right to voluntarily terminate employment (other than for “good reason” in certain cases) following a change in control and receive severance and are not entitled to any “single-trigger” vesting of equity awards or other benefits upon a change in control unless the executive’s employment terminates in the circumstances described below. In each case, the Named Executive Officer’s right to receive the severance benefits described below in connection with a termination of the executive’s employment (other than as a result of death or disability) is subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company.
For Messrs. Burns and Tobey, the following summary is based upon employments agreement in effect during fiscal year 2025. As noted above, Messrs. Burns and Tobey entered into new employment agreements on May 6, 2025, and April 9, 2025, respectively, the terms of which are described above. See “—Employment Agreements” above.

Estimated Severance and Change in Control Benefits
Severance Benefits. The following chart presents our estimate of the dollar value of the benefits each of the Named Executive Officers would have been entitled to receive, had his employment terminated under the circumstances described above (other than in connection with a change in control of the Company) on March 31, 2025 (with the value of equity awards calculated based on the $8.85 and $7.92 closing prices of Class A voting shares and Class B non-voting shares, respectively, on March 31, 2025, the last trading day of fiscal 2025). Since this hypothetical termination would have occurred on the last day of the fiscal year, no pro-rata bonus was included in the cash severance in the charts below.

As described above, Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns would also be entitled to these benefits pursuant to their respective employment agreements if their employment is terminated by the executive for good reason.
(2)
These columns report the intrinsic value of the unvested portions of each executive’s awards that would accelerate in the circumstances. For stock options and SARs, this value is calculated by multiplying the amount (if any) by which the closing price of the applicable class of the Company’s common shares on the last trading day of the fiscal year exceeds the exercise price or base price of the award by the number of shares subject to the accelerated portion of the award. No value is included in the table for stock options and SARs with a per-share exercise price that is greater than or equal to the closing price of the applicable class of the Company’s shares on the last trading day of the fiscal year. For restricted share unit awards, this value is calculated by multiplying the closing price of the applicable class of the Company’s common shares on the last trading day of the fiscal year by the number of units subject to the accelerated portion of the award.
(3)
Includes $61,123 for payment of COBRA premiums and $485,888 for payment of continued life and disability insurance premiums.
(4)
As described above, the term of Mr. Burns’ prior employment agreement expired on October 30, 2024, and he and the Company did not enter into a new employment agreement until May 6, 2025. Under his prior agreement, if his employment were terminated without cause or for good reason, he would be entitled to severance equal to the present value of his remaining base salary through the end of the term of the agreement. Accordingly, he would not have been entitled to any cash severance if his employment with the Company had terminated in these circumstances on March 31, 2025 as the agreement did not provide for a minimum severance amount and the term of the agreement had expired on October 30, 2024.

For Messrs. Barge, Goldsmith, and Tobey, the equity acceleration value reported in this table only applies to a termination without cause. If such executives’ employment had been terminated for good reason on or within 12 months following a change in control or a “change in management,” the equity acceleration value would be the same as described above for a termination without cause not in connection with a change in control. A change in management in these Named Executive Officers’ employment agreements would generally occur when both Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns are no longer employed by the Company.
Pay Ratio Disclosure
Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are required to disclose in this prospectus the ratio of the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the total annual compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer). Based on SEC rules for this disclosure and applying the methodology described below, we have determined that our Chief Executive Officer’s total compensation for fiscal 2025 was $9,823,232, and the median of the total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) for fiscal 2025 was $131,000. Accordingly, we estimate the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer’s total compensation for fiscal 2025 to the median of the total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) for fiscal 2025 to be 75 to 1.
We have selected March 31, 2025, which is a date within the last three months of fiscal 2025, as the date to be used to identify the Company’s median employee. To find the median of the annual total compensation of all the Company’s employees (excluding the Company’s Chief Executive Officer), we used the amount of each employee’s total cash compensation (i.e., base salary, wages, overtime and bonus) from the Company’s payroll
61
Table of Contents
records. In making this determination, we did not annualize compensation for those employees who did not work for the Company for the entire fiscal year. We also did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee. We believe total cash compensation for all employees will be an appropriate measure because total cash compensation data is readily available, and the Company considers this a reasonable measure of employees’ overall compensation.
As of March 31, 2025, we had a total of 1,613 employees, of whom 1,322 were based in the U.S. and 291 were based outside of the U.S. In making the determination of the median employee, we did not include 5 employees based in Australia, 3 employees based in China, 38 employees based in India, 1 employee based in Indonesia, 2 employees based in Luxembourg and 3 employees based in Spain, in accordance with SEC rules permitting exclusion of a de minimis number of non-U.S. employees (so that all U.S.-based employees and 239 employees based outside of the U.S. were included in this determination).
This pay ratio is an estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio to be reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

The annual equity retainer consisted of an award of restricted share units granted under the 2023 Stock Incentive Plan with a grant date value of $150,000 granted on November 29, 2024 (with $75,000 of the value based on the closing price of Class A voting shares on the date of grant and $75,000 of the value based on the closing price of Class B non-voting shares on the date of grant, and the number of units rounded to the nearest whole unit). The restricted share units will vest after one year following the date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of the annual general meeting of shareholders in the year after the year of grant).
The annual cash retainer and other retainers set forth in the table above were paid, at the director’s election, in all cash, 50% in cash and 50% in the form of shares of common stock (with 50% paid in Class A voting shares and 50% in Class B non-voting shares), or 100% in the form of shares of common stock (with 50% paid in Class A voting shares and 50% in Class B non-voting shares). Retainers were paid in two installments, with the number of shares of common stock delivered in payment of any retainer determined by dividing the dollar amount of the retainer paid in the form of shares of common stock by the closing price of common stock (either Class A voting shares or Class B non-voting shares, as applicable) on the date of payment, and such shares being fully vested at the time of payment.
Pursuant to the Company’s policies, non-employee directors were also reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.
For fiscal 2026, the Company’s non-employee directors will be compensated as follows:

The annual equity retainer will consist of an award of restricted share units granted under the Company’s equity incentive plan then in effect with a grant date value of $150,000 granted annually on the date of the Company’s annual general meeting of shareholders (with the value based on the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant, and the number of units rounded to the nearest whole unit). The restricted share units will vest after one (1) year following the date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of the annual general meeting of shareholders in the year after the year of grant) and are paid in an equivalent number of the Company’s common shares. The Board retains discretion to provide for the award to instead be granted as a fixed amount of cash subject to the same vesting terms. The Board may also provide non-employee directors an election to defer payment of their vested awards in accordance with applicable tax law.
63
Table of Contents
The annual cash retainer and other retainers set for in the table above will be paid, at the director’s election, in all cash, 50% in cash and 50% in the form of the Company’s common shares, or 100% in the form of the Company’s common shares. The Board retains discretion to provide for the retainers for one or more directors to be paid in a different mix of cash and the Company’s common shares as it determines appropriate. The retainers are paid in two (2) installments each year and, if applicable, the number of the Company’s common shares to be delivered in payment of the retainer are determined by dividing the dollar amount of the retainer to be paid by the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the date of payment, and fully vested at the time of payment.
Pursuant to the Company’s policies, Non-Employee Directors will also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.
The Board (or any committee of the Board within the authority delegated to it) has the right to amend the Company’s director compensation policy from time to time.
Director Onboarding and Education
Upon a new director’s appointment to the Board, an orientation is conducted by senior management and current Board members aiming to acquaint new directors with the Company’s business strategies, vital financial aspects, core values encompassing ethics and compliance, corporate governance practices, and key policies.
Additionally, the Company actively supports the ongoing education of its Board members, covering expenses for relevant continuing education programs.
Fiscal 2025 Director Compensation
The following table presents information regarding compensation earned or paid to each of the Company’s non-employee directors for services rendered during fiscal 2025. Messrs. Feltheimer and Burns, who were employed by the Company, did not receive any compensation for their services on the Board.

The amounts reported in column (b) represent director annual retainer and chair fees, for fiscal 2025, paid, at the director’s election, either 50% in cash and 50% in the form of existing common stock, 100% in the form of common stock, or 100% in cash, as described above. The value of the common shares is calculated using the closing price of shares of common stock on the date of payment. Retainers and fees are paid twice a year. During fiscal 2025, the Company’s non-employee directors who elected to receive 50% of their

Table of Contents
retainers and fees in the form of common shares received the following number of shares: Ms. Clyburn, 3,213 shares, Mr. Simm, 4,177 shares and Mr. Simmons, 4,177 shares. During fiscal 2025, the Company’s non-employee directors who elected to receive 100% of their retainers and fees in the form of common shares received the following number of shares: Mr. Crawford, 7,712 shares, Ms. Fine, 6,426 shares, Mr. Harkey, 11,627 shares, Ms. Ostolaza, 7,712 shares, Dr. Rachesky, 11,052 shares, and Mr. Sloan, 6,426 shares. For fiscal 2025, the Board determined that Mr. Fries and Ms. McCaw would receive 100% of their cash retainer and fees in the form of cash. Additionally, the Board determined that Mr. Fries would receive 100% of his equity retainer in the form of cash (so that the amount reported in this column for Mr. Fries includes cash received in lieu of any equity award).
(2)
Each non-employee director then in office received a grant of 9,102 restricted share units with respect to Class A voting shares and 10,176 restricted share units with respect to Class B non-voting shares units on November 29, 2024 (other than Mr. Fries, who receives cash in lieu of equity grants). The amounts reported in column (c) reflect the fair value of these awards on the grant date as determined under the principles used to calculate the value of equity awards for purposes of the Company’s financial statements. The fair values of the restricted share units are determined based on the market value of the shares on the date of grant.

Climate Risk Exposure and Awareness
As a content-driven entertainment company, our core operations do not involve manufacturing, large-scale physical infrastructure, or resource-intensive industrial processes. As such, we have limited direct exposure to climate-related physical and transitional risks compared to companies in more carbon-intensive sectors.
Nonetheless, we recognize the growing importance of climate awareness and environmental responsibility in corporate governance. We remain mindful of the broader implications of climate change, including potential impacts on our facilities, supply chain partners, production logistics, and evolving stakeholder expectations.
While climate-related risks are not currently material to our business, we continue to monitor regulatory developments, industry best practices, and stakeholder perspectives. We also consider opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint—such as promoting sustainable production practices, managing energy usage across our operations, and engaging with partners who share our commitment to environmental responsibility.
Climate Policies
•  In all our offices, we prioritize efforts to prevent pollution, and to conserve, recover, and recycle materials, water and energy wherever possible.
65
Table of Contents
•  Our productions distribute documents electronically to minimize paper consumption and waste and limit the use of single-use plastics.   •  Our productions follow best practices featured in the Producers Guild of America and Sustainable Production Alliance’s Green Production Guide, which are designed to reduce the film, television, and streaming industry’s carbon footprint and environmental impact.   •  Our U.S. productions encourage the employment of green vendors that provide sustainable goods and services for film, television and streaming productions.   •  We prioritize vendors whose dedication to operating business in a responsible and sustainable manner directly aligns with those of Lionsgate.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This Form 10-K/A presents the following important financial measures utilized by the Company that are not all financial measures defined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of its business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.
Adjusted OIBDA: Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before adjusted depreciation and amortization (“OIBDA”), adjusted for adjusted share-based compensation (“adjusted SBC”), purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other costs, certain charges (benefits) related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, certain programming and content charges as a result of management changes and/or changes in strategy, and unusual gains or losses (such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment, charges related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the gain on sale of Pantaya on March 31, 2021), when applicable.
•
Adjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statement of operations, less the depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of purchase accounting and related adjustments associated with recent acquisitions. Accordingly, the full impact of the purchase accounting is included in the adjustment for “purchase accounting and related adjustments”, described below.
•
Adjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements, which are included in restructuring and other expenses, when applicable.
•
Restructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and other costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable.
•
COVID-19 related charges or benefits include incremental costs associated with the pausing and restarting of productions including paying/hiring certain cast and crew, maintaining idle facilities and equipment costs, and when applicable, certain motion picture and television impairments and development charges associated with changes in performance expectations or the feasibility of completing the project resulting from circumstances associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, net of insurance recoveries, which are included in direct operating expense, when applicable. In addition, the costs include early or contractual marketing spends for film releases and events that have been canceled or delayed and will provide no economic benefit, which are included in distribution and marketing expense, when applicable.
•
Programming and content charges include certain charges as a result of changes in management and/or changes in programming and content strategy, which are included in direct operating expenses, when applicable.
•
Purchase accounting and related adjustments primarily represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in recent acquisitions. These adjustments include the accretion of the noncontrolling interest discount related to Pilgrim Media Group and 3 Arts Entertainment, the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price and the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense.
Adjusted OIBDA is calculated similar to how the Company defines segment profit and manages and evaluates its segment operations. Segment profit also excludes corporate general and administrative expense.
Total Segment Profit and Studio Business Segment Profit: We present the sum of our Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit as our “Studio Business” segment profit. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in our consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business.
66
Table of Contents
The Company believes the presentation of total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company’s performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company’s segments, both in total and for the Studio Business and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management’s opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.
Overall: These measures are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC and are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations before non-operating items. Adjusted OIBDA is considered an important measure of the Company’s performance because this measure eliminates amounts that, in management’s opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses.
These non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. However, not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.
A general limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the adjusted metrics utilized to their corresponding GAAP metrics are provided below.

Media Networks Restructuring: In fiscal 2023, the Company began a plan to restructure its Media Networks international business, and during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, the Company continued executing its restructuring plan, which included exiting all international territories except for Canada and India, and included an evaluation of the programming on Starz’s domestic and international platforms, resulting in certain programming being removed from those platforms and written down to fair value. The Company has incurred impairment charges from the inception of the Media Networks restructuring plan through March 31, 2025 amounting to $880.1 million. As a result of these restructuring initiatives, the Company recorded content impairment charges related to the Media Networks segment in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 of $136.3 million, $364.5 million, and $379.3 million, respectively.
Content and Other Impairments: Content and other impairments in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 also include content impairments of $7.7 million related to the Motion Picture and Television Production segments associated with exiting local production in certain international territories. In addition, amounts in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 also include impairments of certain operating lease right-of-use and leasehold improvement assets related to the Television Production segment associated with facility leases that will no longer be utilized by the Company primarily related to the integration of eOne.
Content and other impairments in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 also include $12.8 million of development costs written off in connection with changes in strategy in the Television Production segment as a result of the acquisition of eOne.
Content and other impairments in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 also include an impairment of operating leases right-of-use asset related to the Studio business and corporate facilities amounting to $5.8 million associated with a portion of a facility lease that will no longer be utilized by the Company. The lease impairments reflects a decline in market conditions since the inception of the leases impacting potential sublease opportunities, and represents the difference between the estimated fair value, which was determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying value.
(b)
Severance costs were primarily related to restructuring, acquisition integration activities and other cost-saving initiatives. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, in connection with the Company’s current restructuring plan, approximately 8% of its eligible U.S. employees elected to take advantage of voluntary severance and early retirement packages. A total of approximately $26.0 million in severance expense was incurred under the voluntary severance program and was recognized in restructuring and other in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, amounts were due to restructuring activities including integration of the acquisition of eOne, Media Networks international restructuring and our Motion Picture and Television Production segments.
(c)
Amounts represents certain incremental general and administrative costs associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, such as costs related to transitioning the Company to a remote-work environment, costs associated with return-to-office safety protocols, and other incremental general and administrative costs associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Table of Contents
(d)
Amounts reflect transaction, integration and legal costs associated with certain strategic transactions, and restructuring activities and also include costs and benefits associated with legal and other matters. In fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, amounts include costs associated with the separation of the Starz Business from the Studio Business, and acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of eOne. In fiscal 2024, amounts also include $49.2 million associated with the acquisition of additional interest in 3 Arts Entertainment. Due to the new arrangement representing a modification of terms of the compensation element under the previous arrangement which resulted in the reclassification of the equity award to a liability award, the Company recognized incremental compensation expense of $49.2 million, representing the excess of the fair value of the modified award over amounts previously expensed. In addition, transaction and other costs in fiscal 2024 includes approximately $16.6 million of a loss associated with a theft at a production of a 51% owned consolidated entity. In the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the Company recognized a benefit of $3.1 million for insurance recoveries related to the loss. The Company also expects to recover a portion of the loss from the noncontrolling interest holders of this entity. In fiscal 2025 and 2024, transaction and other costs also include a benefit of $7.1 million and $5.4 million associated with an arrangement to migrate subscribers in some of the exited territories to a third-party in connection with the Starz international restructuring. In fiscal 2023, transaction and other costs include a benefit of $11.0 million for a settlement of a legal matter related to the Media Networks segment.
(5)
Amounts represent the incremental costs, if any, included in direct operating expense resulting from circumstances associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, net of insurance recoveries. During fiscal 2025, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company has incurred a net benefit in direct operating expense due to insurance recoveries in excess of the incremental costs expensed in the period. These charges (benefits) are excluded from segment operating results.

Mr. Feltheimer was the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for each of the five fiscal years included in the table above. For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs were Messrs. Burns, Barge, Goldsmith and Corii Berg, the Company’s former General Counsel. For fiscal year 2023, the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs were Messrs. Burns, Barge, Goldsmith, Tobey and Berg. For fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs were Messrs. Burns, Barge, Goldsmith, and Tobey.
(2)
See the Summary Compensation Table above for detail on the total compensation for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for fiscal year 2025. The total compensation for the CEO and the average compensation for the Non-PEO NEOs for each of the earlier fiscal years was calculated from the Summary Compensation Table as disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the calendar year in which the applicable fiscal year ended.
(3)
For purposes of this table, the compensation actually paid (also referred to as “CAP”) to each of Lionsgate’s NEOs (including, for purposes of this table, former Named Executive Officers as noted above) is equal to the NEO’s total compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable fiscal year and adjusted for the following with respect to that NEO:
•
Less the amounts reported in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns of the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable fiscal year,
•
Plus the fiscal year-end value of Company option and stock awards granted in the covered fiscal year which were outstanding and unvested at the end of the covered fiscal year,
•
Plus/(less) the change in value as of the end of the covered fiscal year as compared to the value at the end of the prior fiscal year for Company option and stock awards which were granted in prior fiscal years and were outstanding and unvested at the end of the covered fiscal year,
•
Plus the vesting date value of Company option and stock awards which were granted and vested during the same covered fiscal year,
•
Plus/(less) the change in value as of the vesting date as compared to the value at the end of the prior fiscal year for Company option and stock awards which were granted in prior fiscal years and vested in the covered fiscal year,
•
Less, as to any Company option and stock awards which were granted in prior fiscal years and were forfeited during the covered fiscal year, the value of such awards as of the end of the prior fiscal year,
•
Plus the dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid during the covered fiscal year on outstanding and unvested Company stock awards not otherwise included,
•
Plus, as to a Company option or stock award that was materially modified during the covered fiscal year, the amount by which the value of the award as of the date of the modification exceeds the value of the original award on the modification date. In making each of these adjustments, the “value” of an option or stock award is the fair value of the award on the applicable date determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 using the valuation assumptions the Company then used to calculate the fair value of its equity awards. For more information on the valuation of the Company’s equity awards, please see the notes to the Company’s financial statements that appear in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for each fiscal year and the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table that appears in the Company’s annual proxy statement.  71 The table above reflects the CAP (determined as noted above) for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and, for the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs, the average of the CAPs determined for the Non-PEO NEOs for each of the fiscal years shown in the table.

The Company’s TSR represents cumulative total shareholder return on a fixed investment of $100 in existing common stock for the period beginning on the last trading day of fiscal year 2020 through the end of the applicable fiscal year, and is calculated assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The Dow Jones U.S. Media Sector Index TSR and the S&P Movies & Entertainment Index (which the Company also utilizes in the stock performance graph required by Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K included in its Annual Reports for each covered fiscal year) represent cumulative total shareholder return on a fixed investment of $100 in the Dow Jones U.S. Media Sector Index and the S&P Movies & Entertainment Index, respectively, for the period beginning on the last trading day of fiscal year 2020 through the end of the applicable fiscal year, and are calculated assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The following chart illustrates the CAP for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the average CAP for the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs for each of the last five fiscal years against the Company’s total shareholder return and the total shareholder return for each of the Dow Jones U.S. Media Sector and the S&P Movies & Entertainment Index (each calculated as described above) over that period of time.  72
(5)
This column shows the Company’s net income (loss) for each fiscal year covered by the table. The following chart illustrates the CAP for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the average CAP for the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs for each of the last five fiscal years against the Company’s net income for each of those years.
(6)
This column shows the Company’s adjusted OIBDA for each fiscal year covered by the table. The Company considers adjusted OIBDA to be a key metric in its executive compensation program, used in determining corporate performance under the fiscal year 2025 annual incentive plan. See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this report for more information regarding the use of this performance measure in the Company’s executive compensation program. The following chart illustrates the CAP for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the average CAP for the Company’s Non-PEO NEOs for each of the last five fiscal years against the Company’s adjusted OIBDA for each of those years.  73
Following is an unranked list of the Company’s financial performance measures it considers most important in linking the compensation actually paid to the Company’s NEOs for fiscal 2025 with the Company’s performance.
•
Adjusted OIBDA (used in determining corporate performance for purposes of the annual incentive plan); and
•
Certain Discretionary Assessment of Achievement of Operational and Strategic Goals (used in determining individual performance for purposes of the annual incentive plan and the vesting of performance-based equity awards). See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section for more information regarding the use of these performance measures in the Company’s executive compensation program. In general, the Company also views its stock price, upon which the value of all of the equity awards granted by the Company is dependent, as a key performance-based component of its executive compensation program in order to further align the interests of the Company’s senior management with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.  74

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
Lionsgate recognizes that transactions it may conduct with any of its directors, director nominees or executive officers may present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that decisions are based on considerations other than Lionsgate’s best interests and those of its shareholders. Lionsgate has established, and the Board has adopted, a written Related Person Transactions Policy to monitor transactions, arrangements or relationships, including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, in which Lionsgate and any of the following have an interest: (i) any person who is or was an executive officer, director, or director nominee of Lionsgate at any time since the beginning of Lionsgate’s last fiscal year; (ii) a person who is or was an immediate family member (as defined in the policy) of an executive officer, director, or director nominee at any time since the beginning of Lionsgate’s last fiscal year; (iii) any person who, at the time of the occurrence or existence of the transaction, is greater than 5% beneficial owner of Lionsgate’s common shares; (iv) any person who, at the time of the occurrence or existence of the transaction, is an immediate family member (as defined in the policy) of the greater than 5% beneficial owner of Lionsgate’s common shares; or (v) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest (which we refer to in this report as a “related person”). The policy covers any transaction where the aggregate amount is expected to exceed $120,000 in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest.
The full text of the Related Person Transaction Policy is available on Lionsgate’s website at https://investors.lionsgate.com/governance/governance-documents or may be obtained in print, without charge, by any shareholder upon request to Lionsgate’s Corporate Secretary.
Certain Other Agreements
See Other Related Party Transactions in Note 21 in the Original Filing.
Transactions with Equity Method Investees
See Other Related Party Transactions in Note 21 in the Original Filing.
Director Independence
It is the policy of the Board that, as required by the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, a majority of directors be “independent” of Lionsgate and its management. For a director to be deemed “independent,” the Board will affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with Lionsgate or its affiliates or any member of the senior management of Lionsgate or his/her affiliates.
Pursuant to Lionsgate’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board undertook a review of director independence in May 2025. During the review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director or any member of his/her immediate family and Lionsgate and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those reported under the heading “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” above. The Board also examined transactions and relationships with Lionsgate between directors or their affiliates and members of Lionsgate’s senior management or their affiliates. As provided in Lionsgate’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is “independent.” The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with assistance from counsel, regularly reviews Lionsgate’s Corporate Governance Guidelines to ensure their compliance with Canadian law, SEC and New York Stock Exchange regulations. The full text of Lionsgate’s Corporate Governance Guidelines is available on its website at http://investors.lionsgate.com/governance/governance-documents, or may be obtained in print, without charge, by any shareholder upon request to Lionsgate’s Corporate Secretary, at either of its principal executive offices.

Table of Contents
As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Crawford, Fries, Harkey, Rachesky, Rosenblatt and Sloan and Mmes. Fine, McCaw and Ostolaza, are “independent” under Lionsgate’s Standards for Director Independence, which is available on its website at http://investors.lionsgate.com/governance/governance-documents, Canadian standards, SEC rules and regulations (for Audit & Risk Committee members) and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards (including the enhanced independence requirements for compensation committee members).
A number of Lionsgate’s independent board members are currently serving or have served as directors or as members of senior management of other public companies. All of the committees of the Board are comprised solely of independent directors, each with a different independent director serving as chair of the committee. Lionsgate believes that the number of independent experienced directors that make up the Board, along with the independent oversight of the Board by the non-executive Chair, benefits Lionsgate and its shareholders.
