EXPLANATORY
NOTE
CoJax
Oil and Gas Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the “Company”) filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Original Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on March 31, 2025. This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this “Amendment” or “Form 10-K/A”)
is being filed to restate certain information in the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, contained in the Original Form 10-K (the “Restatement”) for the reasons stated
below.
On
August 28, 2025, the Board of directors of the Company, after discussion with management and its auditors, determined that the
Company’s previously issued financial statements included in the Original Form 10-K should not be relied upon. This
Amendment sets forth the Original Form 10-K, as modified and superseded where necessary, to reflect the Restatement. Accordingly,
certain statements related to the guidance of FASB ASC 280-10-50-28C, it has updated the Segment Information on
page [F-53] of the Amended Form 10-K. The disclosure has been updated to state that net income (loss) is the measure used by the
CODM to evaluate the segment’s performance and to allocate capital and monitor budget versus actual results.
The
Company filed an audit report that covers the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, but
which does not extend to the comparative financial statements for 2023. The Company has included an updated audit opinion that
covers both periods in compliance with Rules 2-02(a)(4) and 8-02 of Regulation S-X.
Pursuant
to Rule 12b-15 under the Exchange Act, this Form 10-K/A also contains new certifications (31.1 and 31.2) pursuant to Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Accordingly, this Form 10-K/A includes the currently dated certifications as exhibits.
Except
as described above, this Amendment does not amend, update or change any other disclosures in the Original Form 10-K. In addition,
the information contained in this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the Original Form 10-K and does not modify
or update the disclosures therein, except to reflect the effects of the Restatement. This Amendment should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s other filings with the SEC.

ITEM
1. BUSINESS
Overview
We
are an early-stage development oil and gas company seeking to become an independent energy company. Our assets and principal properties
are located in the Gulf States Drill Region, where we target acquisition and subsequent exploitation and development of crude
oil, including acquisitions of hydrocarbon revenues and underlying oil and gas exploration and production rights. We believe that
we can establish a profitable niche in crude oil production due to the quality of the light sweet crude oil produced from the
Gulf States Drill Region, which is cheaper to refine than crude oil from other regions of the U.S. and Canada.
The
Company was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia on November 13, 2017, and started its operations on November 17,
2020, upon an acquisition (the “Barrister Acquisition”) of all outstanding capital of Barrister, including all of
Barrister’s crude oil and natural gas exploration and production leases and rights owned or controlled by Barrister.  In
consideration for the Barrister Acquisition, the Company issued 3,650,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par
value per share (the “Common Stock”) to the members of Barrister and assumed Barrister’s debt obligations to
Central Operating, LLC  (“COP”) in principal amount of $2,700,000, which was discharged on November 16, 2021
pursuant to a debt exchange agreement between the Company and COP in exchange for the issuance of 1,350,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock to COP. Currently we are producing very limited crude oil production from limited oil drilling operations as a result
of the Barrister Acquisition. It is insufficient to fund new acquisitions or drilling without additional funding or equity transactions.
On
November 8, 2022, the Company, through Barrister, its wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired from Taxodium Energy, LLC, a Mississippi
limited liability company (“Taxodium”), 100% ownership, right, title and interest in certain properties located in
Mississippi and Alabama, including all oil and gas leases, interests, royalties, overriding royalties, subleases, fee estates,
net profit interest, and carried interests (collectively, “NONOP Assets”) pursuant to the Assignment, Bill of Sale
and Conveyance, dated October 31, 2022, executed by Taxodium. This transaction became effective on October 1, 2022, for accounting
purposes, based on when the Company obtained control of the acquired assets.
On
December 2, 2022, the Company, through Barrister, acquired from Taxodium a 100% ownership, right, title and interests in additional
properties located in Mississippi, including certain wells, facilities, the oil gas and mineral leases, together with all surface
and subsurface and all operating rights, working interest, and net revenue interest arising out of such leases and rights (collectively,
“Buckley Assets”) pursuant to the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance, dated December 2, 2022, executed by Taxodium
and Barrister.
While
the Company acquired these new properties, including drilling wells, currently, these wells have very limited productions, not
sufficient for the Company to become profitable.
On
May 31, 2024, the Company, through Barrister, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain various mineral
and oil and gas properties, lands and leases located in Mississippi and related assets from Liberty Operating Company, LLC (“Liberty”)
pursuant to the Assignment and Bill of Sale, entered into and executed by Barrister and Liberty on May 31, 2024. The Acquisition
has an effective date of May 1, 2024, for accounting purposes.
On
August 29, 2024, the Company, through Barrister, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain various mineral
and oil and gas properties, lands and leases located in Mississippi and related assets from Liberty pursuant to the Assignment
and Bill of Sale, entered into and executed by Barrister and Liberty on August 29, 2024. The Acquisition has an effective date
of July 1, 2024, for accounting purposes.

Our
Growth Strategy
The
Company is seeking to acquire existing underexploited conventional oil and natural gas producing properties and rights in the
Gulf States Drill Region. These properties typically contain upside potential through operational efficiencies and recompletions
to behind pipe zones and infill drilling.  Our long-term goal is to create shareholder value by identifying and assembling
a portfolio of low-risk assets with attractive economic profiles. Our ability to implement our business plan is subject, in part,
on our ability to timely raise adequate and affordable funding from investors or lenders for establishing acquisitions. Our first
acquisition was Barrister, followed by the acquisition of NONOP Assets and Buckley Assets in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2024,
we acquired the non-operated interests of Liberty Operating Company, LLC in two separate fields located within Mississippi. Our
efforts now involve raising sufficient working capital to perform planned well work on existing properties in order to increase
gross production and cash flow.
The
Company will continue to seek acquisitions that can be obtained in exchange for the Company’s stock or under an earn-out
arrangement. Preference is given to existing producing properties or companies wishing to divest all their assets. The acquisition
of a company that holds oil and leases rights has the perceived advantages of acquiring several oil leases and rights and existing
drilling operations with in-place management in a single transaction.
Our
teaming approach is also designed to facilitate rapid growth by bringing necessary expertise into operations from available contractors.
Our ability to realize profitability from oil and gas production may also depend upon the success of drill wells, engaging
necessary operations expertise, and market price for crude oil and natural gas remaining at attractive levels. If we have adequate
funding and/or sufficient cash flow, then we may seek to drill for oil in other assignee or leasehold interests or, alternatively,
in oil and gas assignee or leasehold interests or properties owned by our potential affiliates or teaming partners. The Company
currently allows the purchasers to market its crude oil and natural gas production, whether current or future, on a month-to-month
basis.
If
the production of oil increases from the properties in which the Company obtains its oil rights, the Company will have to expand
the marketing efforts by engaging a person or firm to seek out new customers for the oil production in case the current customer
base is unable or unwilling to purchase increased oil production. The cost means and extent of any enhanced future marketing effort
will depend on the amount of increased oil production, the then-current market for oil, and the potential customer base for the
oil production. If the existing customer base will not purchase increased oil production, then the engagement of a dedicated marketing
person who engages in direct marketing, by telephone and internet, of potential customers for oil production may be required for
the sale of any future increase of oil production.

Competitive
Strengths
Use
of Contractors
Our
strategy is to develop our assets in a manner that generates sustainable cash flow and improves margins and operating efficiencies
while improving our environmental, social and governance and safety performance. The Company relies on the extensive experience
of William R. Downs, our Chief Executive Officer, who has more than 42 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. In addition,
the Company utilizes experienced contractors, including former members of Barrister, who have significant oil and gas production
experience in the Gulf States Drill Region. This approach is particularly valuable during the initial phases of implementing our
business plan.  We believe this contractor model is the most efficient and cost-effective way to operate as a small independent
oil and gas producer, enabling us to leverage expert drilling and production personnel without incurring the high overhead of
full-time employees. Currently, we engage COP and Taxodium as our contractors to manage drilling storage and production operations
for our oil rights.   These contractors bring extensive experience with operational and administrative expertise and
provide the skilled personnel necessary to handle daily crude oil production.   With adequate funding, we plan to expand
this teaming model to attract and retain experienced oil industry engineers and production specialists. Their role will be to
identify acquisitions and drill sites and operate wells efficiently to achieve industry-leading production rates.
Seasonality
Our
drill sites in the Gulf States Drill Region allow for year-round drilling. However, adverse weather conditions can affect drilling,
completion, and field operations, as well as third-party midstream and downstream pipeline operations, thereby influencing overall
production volumes. which can impact overall production volumes. Variations in seasonal weather patterns can either lessen or
intensify these impacts, and extreme weather events may temporarily constrain our operations.
Title
to Oil and Natural Gas Properties
In
the oil and gas industry, it is customary to conduct only a preliminary review of title to undeveloped oil and natural gas leases
at acquisition. More extensive title examinations are typically performed when we prepare to develop the leases or acquire producing
properties. In future acquisitions, we will conduct title examinations on material portions of such properties in a manner generally
consistent with industry practice. The properties we have acquired may be subject to certain imperfections in title, encumbrances,
easements, servitudes or other restrictions, none of which, in management’s opinion, will materially restrict our operations.
Competition
The
Company competes with many companies of all sizes in the Gulf States Drill Region and adjacent areas. Many of these competitors
have extensive operational histories, seasoned management, established market share, and profitable operations. They also possess
significant oil and gas fields or leases to exploit and the funding to explore new fields or acquire mature ones.
There is also an established oil and gas production industry in northern Alaska and in North Dakota and western Canada. Many of
our competitors not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also have midstream and further downstream operations
and market a variety of hydrocarbon products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, oil and natural gas compete
with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. Oil and natural gas compete with alternative energy
sources—such as wind, solar, coal, and fuel oils—primarily on price. Changes in energy availability, pricing, market
conditions, and regulatory factors may affect demand.
The
Company has a limited operating history of its business operation and lacks the financial, technical, and manpower resources,
proven crude oil reserves, and distribution channels of its competitors.  The Company’s current production levels are
modest enough that they do not attract significant attention from competitors, which allows it to operate as a small producer
of oil and gas without competitive pressures.  If oil production increase significantly, we may face stiffer competition
from other small independent oil producers. Any increase in competitive pressure would likely necessitate a dedicated, full-time
marketing effort.
Company
Oil Rights
Description
of Oil Properties and Oil Production Operations. The Company’s current oil and gas assets primarily consist
of non-operating interests. Nevertheless, production from these assets has significantly enhanced our operational capability.
As
shown in the tables below, production has significantly improved following the asset acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2022.
However, the Company will not be able to increase production until sufficient financial resources are secured through debt and
equity financing. Additionally, if production levels cannot be restored to previous benchmarks, the Company may need to write
down some of these assets.
The
Smackover Trend.  The Smackover trend is a belt of Late Jurassic carbonate, evaporite, and clastic rocks that
rims the Gulf Coast of the United States. It spans from Texas to Arkansas and extends through Louisiana, Mississippi, Southwest
Alabama, and the Florida panhandle.  Stratigraphic and geochemical data indicate that the oil and gas were generated from
algae-rich lime mudstones.  The trend was named after the Smackover oil field, which was discovered in Union County, Arkansas,
in 1937.

Current
Barrister Energy Properties.   As of the date of this Annual Report, we have interests in 55 wells. In the fourth
quarter of 2022, we acquired interest in 29 of those wells. In the second and third quarters of 2024, we acquired interest in
15 and 9 of those wells, respectively.
The
table below summarizes production, average production prices, and average production costs by final product sold for the last
three years. All production during the three years presented occurred in the United States.

Our
investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous leases. The List of Leases is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this
Annual Report. The terms and conditions under which the Company maintains exploration and production rights to the acreage are
property-specific, contractually defined, and vary significantly by property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration
potential of any property is thoroughly evaluated before expiration. In some instances, we may elect to relinquish acreage in
advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business justification for
an extension. In cases where additional time may be required to evaluate acreage fully, the Company has generally been successful
in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years
is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
12
Government
Regulation
Oil
and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation, and other legal requirements
enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry are under constant
review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory
burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, can affect our profitability.
Because these laws, rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted and new laws, rules and regulations are promulgated,
we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are, or will
be required to comply.
Regulation
of Drilling and Production
The
production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state, and federal statutes, rules, orders,
and regulations. Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and
reports concerning operations. The trend in oil and natural gas regulation has been to increase regulatory restrictions and limitations
on such activities. Any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations may result in delays or restrictions
in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities
or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued: (1) an order signed by the acting Secretary of
the Interior providing for a 60-day pause (ii) an executive order signed by President Biden instruction the Department of the
Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and consideration
of federal oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices (together, the “Biden Administration Federal Lease Orders”).
The U.S. District Court for the District of Louisiana enjoined the pause within 13 states, including Texas, in August 2022. The
Department of the Interior has recently resumed lease sales in several states. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued
(i) an order providing for a 60-day moratorium on new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits on federal land, limiting the authority
of local offices of the BLM to issue new leases and grant federal drilling permits and certain extensions, sundries, rights-of-way
and other necessary approvals for the development of federal oil and natural gas leases; and (ii) and executive order signed by
President Biden instructing the Department of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands, pending a
full review of the federal leasing and permitting program. While we do not have a significant federal land acreage position at
240 net acres, these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company and our industry.
Currently,
all our properties and operations are in Alabama and Mississippi, which have regulations governing conservation matters, such
as the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from
oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations
is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations
at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover,
Alabama and Mississippi impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and
natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial
penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions
that affect our operations.
13
Regulation
of Transportation of Oil
Sales
of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices; however, Congress
could reenact price controls in the future.
Our
sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier
pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, regulates interstate oil
pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation
by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and
scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates
are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect
our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Further, interstate and intrastate common
carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must
offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full
capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we
believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
Regulation
of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas
Historically,
the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act
of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and regulations issued under those Acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government
has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at
uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Since
1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open
and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure
of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more
direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale
of transportation and storage services. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they
are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. We cannot accurately predict whether
the FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold. Therefore,
we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we
do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas
producers.
Intrastate
natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural
gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services
varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural
gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas
transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in
any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
Environmental,
Health and Safety Regulations
The
exploration, development, production, gathering and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, drilling,
completing and operating oil and natural gas wells, midstream facilities and produced water injection and disposal wells. Our
activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: the Oil Pollution Act
of 1990 (the “OPA 90”), the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (the
“CAA”) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), as well as comparable state statutes and regulations.
We also may be subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of wastes generated by our
activities and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) that may result from our oil and natural gas operations.
Administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with these environmental laws and regulations,
and violations and liability with respect to these laws and regulations could also result in remedial clean-ups, natural resource
damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. Additionally, these
laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking some activities,
may limit or prohibit other activities because of protected wetlands, areas or species and require investigation and cleanup of
pollution. These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the production rate of oil and natural gas or limit the injection
of produced water into disposal wells below the rates that would otherwise be possible. We expect to remain in compliance in all
material respects with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not expect that these laws and regulations
will have a material adverse impact on the Company.
14
The
OPA 90 and its regulations impose requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of crude oil spills
and liability for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or on the exclusive economic
zone of the United States. A “responsible party” under the OPA 90 may include the owner or operator of an onshore
facility. The OPA 90 subjects responsible parties to strict, joint and several financial liability for removal and remediation
costs and other damages, including natural resource damages, caused by an oil spill that is covered by the statue. Failure to
comply with the OPA 90 may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement action.
The
CWA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters, fill materials
and other materials into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional
restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits are required to discharge pollutants into certain state and federal waters
and to conduct construction activities in those waters and wetlands. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil,
criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability for the
costs of removal or remediation of contamination resulting from such discharges. In September 2015, a rule issued by the EPA and
U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (the “Corps”) to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”)
for all CWA programs, thereby defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corp’s jurisdiction, became effective. The EPA
rescinded this rule in 2019 and promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”) in 2020. The NWPR was
viewed as narrowing the scope of WOTUS as compared to the 2015 rule. In August 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Arizona vacated and remanded the NWPR. On January 18, 2023, the EPA and the Corps jointly issued a final rule revising the
definition of WOTUS that largely returned to the pre-2015 regulatory regime. On September 8, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued
a decision limiting the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands only to those that have a continuous surface connection to
water bodies. On August 29, 2023, the EPA and the Corps jointly issued a final rule, effective immediately, aligning the regulatory
definition of WOTUS with the Supreme Court’s ruling.
CERCLA,
also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct,
on various classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” in
the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed
of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous
substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances and
for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims
for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA
generally exempts petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, our operations may in the future, involve the use or
handling of materials that are classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws
analogous to CERCLA. RCRA and comparable state and local statues govern the management, including treatment, storage and disposal,
of both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more stringent and costly disposal requirements
than nonhazardous wastes.
The
CAA, as amended, restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas production. In addition,
certain states have comparable legislation, which may be more restrictive than the CAA. These laws and any implementing regulations
impose stringent air permit requirements and require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain
projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions, or to use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Federal
and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other
requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act created the
Methane Emissions Reduction Program to incentivize methane emission reductions and impose a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from
certain facilities that exceed specified emissions levels.
15
Internationally,
in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris
Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the United States in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent
a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions (“NDC”), which set greenhouse gas emission
reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The United States exited the Paris Agreement in November 2020, but rejoined
the agreement effective February 19, 2021. In April 2021, the United States made its NDC submittal, setting an emissions reduction
goal of a 50 to 52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. Further, in November 2021,
the United States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address
climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30% by 2030 and
cooperating toward the advancement of the development of alternative sources of energy.
Any
changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or operating requirements
could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition, as well as those of the oil and natural gas industry
in general. For instance, in January 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order which directed a government-wide effort to address
climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net-zero global carbon emissions by 2050 or before. That effort
is designed to infuse climate policy in all aspects of federal decision-making, including specific directives that touch on foreign
policy, national security, financial regulation, federal procurement, infrastructure, and environmental justice among other things.
Based on this Executive Order and other findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations
to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. On December 2, 2023, the EPA issued a prepublication
version of a final rule to regulate emissions from oil and natural gas sources that includes NSPS to limit greenhouse gas and
volatile organic compound emissions for new, modified or reconstructed sources, as well as emissions guidelines for states to
follow when establishing plans to limit methane emissions from existing sources. Additionally, on November 17, 2023, the EPA issued
a final rule that enables states to implement more stringent methane emissions standards than the federal guidelines require.
As another example, in January 2023, the EPA announced a proposed consent decree that, if finalized as proposed, would establish
a December 10, 2024 deadline for the EPA to review and propose revisions to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants (“NESHAP”) for oil and natural gas production facilities and natural gas transmission and storage facilities,
which may require us to make additional changes to our operations. Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change
and greenhouse gas emissions could, and likely would, require us to incur increased operating costs adversely affecting our profits
and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, depressing the prices we receive for oil and natural
gas.
In
the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil, produced water
or other materials may occur, and we may incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. It is also possible that
our oil and natural gas operations may require us to manage NORM. NORM is present in varying concentrations in sub-surface formations,
including hydrocarbon reservoirs, and may become concentrated in scale, film and sludge in equipment that comes in contact with
crude oil and natural gas production and processing streams. Some states, including Texas and Louisiana, have enacted regulations
governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM.
We
are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the “community
right-to-know” regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and similar state
statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain of
this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject
to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards.
We
have not in the past been, and do not anticipate in the near future to be, required to expend amounts that are material in relation
to our total capital expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, but since these laws and regulations are
periodically amended, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. We have no assurance that more stringent laws
and regulations protecting the environment will not be adopted or that we will not otherwise incur material expenses in connection
with environmental laws and regulations in the future. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers.

RISK
FACTORS
An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones
we face. Risks could also harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects, and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently do not believe are material, and these risks and uncertainties could result in a complete loss
of your investment. Prior to the Barrister Acquisition, we did not have revenue-generating operations that will fund our operating
overhead.  While we began to generate revenue following the Barrister Acquisition, our business, operating results, financial
condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. In assessing the risks
and uncertainties described below, you should also refer to the other information contained herein, including our consolidated
financial statements, pro forma financial statements, and the related notes thereto.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
Risks
Related to the Oil & Natural Gas Industry
Oil
and natural gas prices are volatile, and any sustained decline in oil market prices could adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, and its ability to meet capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.
Our
success is highly dependent on prices for oil and natural gas, which have in recent years been, and we expect will continue to
be, extremely volatile. Oil is a commodity, and its price may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the
supply of and demand for oil and market uncertainty. Historically, oil prices have been volatile due to sensitivity to political
and economic developments or crises. The prices we receive for oil production, and the levels of oil production, depend on numerous
factors beyond our control, which include worldwide and regional economic conditions affecting the global supply and demand for
oil, such as:
●
levels of production,
domestic and worldwide inventories;
●
the capacity of
U.S. and international refiners to use U.S. supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs
●
the price and quantity
of foreign imports of oil and their effect on U.S. oil producers;
●
relative price and
availability of alternative forms of energy;
●
political and economic
conditions in or affecting other oil-producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America, current
invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which significantly affects global oil market price
●
actions of the OPEC,
its members, and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls, especially production
disputes between Saudi Arabia and Russia, who often have different goals
●
the level of global
exploration, development, and production of oil
●
the proximity, capacity,
cost, and availability of oil gathering and transportation facilities; ·
●
localized and global
oil supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability
●
the cost of exploring
for, developing, producing, and transporting oil which cost may go up due to oil storage surpluses created by COVID-19 pandemic
●
weather conditions
and other natural disasters, and storms in the Gulf States Drilling Region appear to increase in intensity in the past five
years
●
technological advances
affecting oil consumption, especially the growing production of electric-powered cars, trucks, and buses
18
●
the price and availability
and consumer demand for alternative fuels to oil and reduction in the use of products that are made from oil, especially certain
plastics, which demand is fueled by environmental concerns
●
climate control
legislation that increases the cost and lowers the demand for oil by providing incentives and tax benefits for use of non-oil
fuels, and
●
effect of existing
U.S. federal, state, and local, and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes.
These
factors make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs price movements with any certainty. During the
three years ended December 31, 2024, NYMEX WTI prices ranged from a high of $123.64 per barrel on March 8, 2022, to a low of $65.75
per barrel on September 10, 2024, and NYMEX Henry Hub prices ranged from a high of $9.51 per MMBtu on August 17, 2022, to a low
of $1.21 per MMBtu on November 11, 2024. We make price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion
of our cash outlays, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments
were based, our financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not
variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices. Specifically,
prices of oil, and NGLs may adversely affect our revenues, cash flows, earnings and returns; our ability to attract capital to
finance our operations and the cost of the capital; the profit or loss we incur in exploring for and developing our reserves;
and the value of our oil and natural gas properties.
A
substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically
and cause a significant portion of our development projects to become uneconomic. This may result in our having to make significant
downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. A reduction in production could also result in a shortfall in expected
cash flows and require us to reduce capital spending, which could negatively affect our ability to replace our production and
our future rate of growth, or require us to borrow funds to cover any such shortfall, which we may be unable to obtain at such
time on satisfactory terms. Additionally, if we are required to curtail our drilling program, we may be unable to continue to
hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce our reserves. As a result, if oil and/or NGL prices experience
a sustained period of weakness, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance
planned capital expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.
Our
business is subject to climate-related transition risks, including evolving climate change legislation, fuel conservation measures,
technological advances and negative shift in market perception towards the oil and natural gas industry, which could result in
increased operating expenses and capital costs, financial risks and potential reduction in demand for oil and natural gas.
The
governmental and regulatory bodies, as well as investors, consumers, industry and other stakeholders increasingly focus on combating
climate change. This attention resulted in the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives, including
alternative energy requirements, new fuel consumption standards, energy conservation and emissions reductions measures and responsible
energy development; technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy, increased
availability of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas (including
wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal sources as well as electric vehicles); and development of, and increased demand from
consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services (including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial
power supplies) as well as more efficient products and services.
19
These
developments may in the future adversely affect the demand for products manufactured with, or powered by, petroleum products,
as well as the demand for, and in turn the prices of, oil and natural gas products. Such developments may also adversely impact,
among other things, our stock price and access to capital markets, and the availability to us of necessary third-party services
and facilities that we rely on, which may increase our operational costs and adversely affect our ability to successfully carry
out our business strategy. Climate change-related developments may also impact the market prices of or our access to raw materials
such as energy and water and therefore result in increased costs to our business.
More
broadly, the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives across the market at the government, corporate,
and/or investor community levels may in the future result in increases in our compliance costs and other operating costs and have
other adverse effects (e.g., greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation).
Seismic
studies do not guarantee that oil or hydrocarbons are present or, if present, will produce in economic quantities.
Oil
exploration and production companies, like we are, rely on seismic studies to assist in assessing prospective drilling opportunities
on oil and gas properties, as well as on properties that a company may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive
tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, will produce in economic or profitable quantities.
Restrictions
on our ability to obtain, recycle and dispose of water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in
a timely or cost-effective manner.
Water
is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If drought conditions were to occur or demand
for water were to outpace supply, our ability to obtain water could be impacted and in turn, our ability to perform hydraulic
fracturing operations could be restricted or made more costly. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from
local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant amounts of water are produced in our operations. Inadequate
access to or availability of water recycling or water disposal facilities could adversely affect our production volumes or significantly
increase the cost of our operations.
Participants
in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous laws that can affect the cost, manner, or feasibility of doing business.
Exploration
and production activities in the oil and gas industry are subject to various laws and regulations. Any oil and gas exploration
and production operated by the Company are or may become subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety
laws and regulations that may be imposed domestically at the federal, regional, state, and local levels. The more significant
of these environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following:
●
The U.S. Clean Air
Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring,
and reporting requirements, and the Environmental Protection Agency or “EPA” has relied upon as authority for
adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to Green House Gases or “GHG” emissions.
●
The U.S. Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities
to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking
as protected waters of the United States
20
●
The U.S. Oil Pollution
Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees
of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in
waters of the United States
●
The U.S. Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers
of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur
●
The U.S. Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes,
including hazardous wastes
●
The U.S. Safe Drinking
Water Act (“SDWA”), which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through the adoption
of drinking water standards and control over the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely
affect drinking water sources
●
The U.S. Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate
information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories
●
The U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including
the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace,
potentially harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures
●
The U.S. Endangered
Species Act, restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats
through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas
●
The U.S. National
Environmental Policy Act, requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate significant agency
actions having the potential to affect the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and
more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment
●
U.S. Department
of Transportation regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials and emergency
response preparedness.
These
environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements, are expected
to have a considerable effect on any expanded Company’s operations in terms of compliance costs.
In
addition, regional, state, and local jurisdictions in the United States where the Company operates or may operate also have, or
are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing
many of these same types of activities. The State of Alabama has extensive operation and licensing laws for oil drilling.
The State Oil and Gas Boards of Mississippi and Alabama are regulatory agencies of the States of Mississippi and Alabama
with the statutory charge of regulating oil exploration and production, including preventing waste and promoting the conservation
of oil and gas while ensuring the protection of both the environment and the correlative rights of owners. These boards are granted
broad authority in state oil and gas conservation statutes to promulgate and enforce rules and regulations to ensure the conservation
and proper development of the state’s’ petroleum resources. Specific regulations may vary from state to state across
the Gulf States Drill Region.  We will rely on consultants and local legal counsel for compliance with the state regulatory
regime.
Failure
to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative,
civil, and criminal penalties. Moreover, new laws and regulations may be enacted, and current laws and regulations could change,
or their interpretations could change, in ways that could substantially increase our costs. The occurrence of any of these factors,
or the continuation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or future results of operations.
Our
operations are subject to operating hazards inherent to our industry that may adversely impact our ability to conduct business,
and we may not be fully insured against all such operating risks.
21
The
operating hazards in exploring for and producing oil and natural gas include: encountering unexpected subsurface conditions that
cause damage to equipment or personal injury, including loss of life; equipment failures that curtail or stop production or cause
severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or other equipment; blowouts or other damages to the productive
formations of our reserves that require a well to be re-drilled or other corrective action to be taken; and storms and other extreme
weather conditions that cause damages to our production facilities or wells. Because of these or other events, we could experience
environmental hazards, including release of oil and natural gas from spills, natural gas leaks, accidental leakage of toxic or
hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or fracturing fluids, including chemical additives, underground
migration, and ruptures. If we experience any of these problems, we could incur substantial losses in excess of our insurance
coverage. The occurrence of a significant event or claim, not fully insured or indemnified against, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and operations. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some of
the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Also, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance
in the future at rates we consider reasonable to cover our possible losses from operating hazards and we may elect no or minimal
insurance coverage. However, we do not have insurance covering environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and even
if we had such insurance, it may not cover penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority.
Negative
public perception of the oil and gas industry could have a material and adverse effect on us.
Oil
and natural gas drilling and development activities are subject to growing negative public perception globally, and particularly,
in the United States resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change may lead to increased
reputational and litigation risk and regulatory, legislative and judicial scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and
federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Companies in the oil and natural
gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety,
human rights, climate change, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. The foregoing factors may cause operational
delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Negative perceptions
regarding our industry and reputational risks may also in the future adversely affect our ability to successfully carry out our
business strategy by adversely affecting our access to capital. Certain segments of the investor community have developed negative
sentiments towards investing in our industry.
Further,
certain investment banks and asset managers based both domestically and internationally have announced that they are adopting
climate change guidelines for their banking and investing activities. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial
and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects. Institutional lenders who provide
financing to companies in the energy sector have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect
not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. Such developments aimed at
limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies,
including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects,
impacting our future financial results.
22
Terrorist
attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our future oil exploration and production business.
The
continued threat of terrorism and the effect of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased
volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets. The U.S. government
has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our
oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on facilities used by Barrister or other future
oil exploration and production operations, those of such operations’ customers, the infrastructure used for transportation
of oil, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Operational
Risks
We
have a limited history of owning and operating oil and gas exploration and production operations.
Prior
to the Barrister Acquisition in November 2020, we had not generated any revenue. Although we acquired Barrister’s business
pursuant to the Barrister Acquisition, these production operations are minimal and commenced less than three years ago. In addition,
the history of obtaining oil rights by Barrister was minimal in terms of production and does not reveal the potential oil production
and profitability of the Company Oil Rights. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired additional oil rights and
interests by purchasing NONOP Assets and Buckley Assets. In the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively, we acquired the
non-operated interests of Liberty Operating Company, LLC in the Liberty and Pine Grove Fields of Mississippi. Now we need to obtain
sufficient funds to develop reserves related to these properties. However, the lack of a more extensive operating history may
discourage lenders or funding sources from providing working capital to the Company.   There is no assurance that the oil
rights acquired by the Company to date will produce oil or natural gas on a profitable basis.  Investors should carefully
consider the lack of operating history of the Company and the lack of any significant oil production from the Company Oil Rights
prior to making an investment decision to invest in the Company. If the Company is unable
to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, its ability to develop future reserves will be adversely affected.
If production or drilling operations are curtailed, then the Company may be unable to continue to hold leases and drilling rights
that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce oil reserves, which will materially and adversely affect future business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.
We
have entered a highly competitive and highly capital-intensive industry, and any oil production may be insufficient to fund, sustain,
or expand revenue-generating operations.
The
oil drilling exploration and production business are capital intensive due to the cost of experienced personnel; equipment and
other assets required to drill, produce and store oil; regulatory compliance costs; potential liability exposures and financial
effects; and the risk of unpredictable volatility in oil market prices and predatory pricing by competitors.  Drilling requires
an upfront payment of operational costs with no guarantee that actual oil production will cover such expenses.  “Dry”
holes for the first and/or second oil wells could deplete any available funding raised by the Company and render the Company insolvent.
The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among
other things, market oil prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment,
and regulatory, technological, and competitive developments.  The Company does not have cash flow or cash reserves sufficient
to fund more extensive and deep drilling on Company Oil Rights.  While we will seek such funding, there are no assurances
that we can obtain funding that will be sufficient to fund deep drill wells or new property acquisitions, which are needed to
produce any significant levels of oil production.   Future cash flow from our operations and access to capital are subject
to a number of variables, including, but not limited to: (i) the market prices at which our oil production is sold; (ii) our proved
reserves; (iii) the level of hydrocarbons we can produce from any future oil wells; (iv) our ability to acquire, locate and produce
new oil reserves; (v) the levels of our operating expenses; (vi) reduction in the U.S. and global demand for oil.
23
Our
acquisitions of oil and gas properties and subsequent exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells
may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.
Exploration,
development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks. Acquiring oil and natural gas exploration and production
rights and leases requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development
and operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. We may invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold
acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that any leasehold
acreage acquired will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion
of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, including
wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs.
In
addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return and wells that
are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Wells may have production decline rates that are greater than anticipated.
Future drilling and completion efforts may impact production from existing wells, and parent-child effects may impact future well
productivity as a result of timing, spacing proximity or other factors. Acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to
assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential
environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments,
we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems.
In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect ever well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental
problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller
for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition
of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. These risks
could render unprofitable our drilling operations and significantly affect the overall financial performance and condition of
the Company. Failure to conduct our oil and gas operations in a profitable manner may result in impairments of our proved reserves
quantities, impairment of our oil and gas properties, and a write-down in the carrying value of our unproved properties, and over
time may adversely affect our growth, revenues and cash flows.
Due
to our contractor model of operations, we will be vulnerable to any inability to engage or retain qualified operational personnel
for new or existing drilling operations.
Our
operation plan depends on a teaming/contractor approach to operate oil rigs. We may be unable to locate or retain a sufficient
number of qualified independent contractors to operate new or existing oil rigs. Finding and engaging qualified independent contractors
will be essential to commencing, expanding, and sustaining drilling operations. Since we will, in all likelihood, depend on one
or two new oil rigs at the start of operations after raising sufficient working capital, any inability to engage or retain qualified
independent contractors would be potentially fatal to our efforts to establish increased revenue-generating operations. The use
of independent contractors also poses the risk of such personnel leaving for more lucrative opportunities with competitors or
other oil producers. Many of our competitors can afford more lucrative compensation packages for qualified personnel. We lack
the resources to effectively compete against larger competitors for operational personnel, especially against competitors with
liquid public markets for their capital stock and the ability to offer attractive stock-based incentive compensation.
Loss
of key operational personnel could cause the suspension of any expanded drilling operations.
The
Company does not have key-man insurance or the available cash to easily employ or engage experienced, full-time outside senior
management personnel. The loss of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and operational personnel of COP and our
other operators that manage the Company’s oil drilling and production could undermine the Company’s ability to
manage operations and implement the Company’s business plan.
With
any expanded oil exploration and drilling, we will need to replace existing oil reserves with new oil reserves and develop those
oil reserves. If we are unable to do so, oil reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect future cash flows
and results of operations.
24
Once
we increase oil production, then producing oil reservoirs generally will be characterized by declining production rates that vary
depending upon oil reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless the Company conducts successful ongoing exploration and
development activities or continually acquires properties containing proved reserves, proved reserves would decline as those reserves
are produced. Future reserves and production, and therefore future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on
the success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable oil reserves.
We may not be able to develop, find, or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If
we are unable to replace current and future oil production, the value of existing reserves will decrease, and business, financial
condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
The
oil and gas development, exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our competitors have greater financial
and other resources than we do.
We
face competition in every aspect of our business, including buying and selling reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services
needed to operate our business and marketing natural gas and oil. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent
production companies and individual producers and operators. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources
than we do and may have greater access to the capital and credit markets. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce
oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional,
national or worldwide basis. As a result, these competitors may be able to address the competitive factors of the industry more
effectively or weather industry downturns more easily than we can. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources,
including wind, solar and electric power.
The
potential lack of availability of, or cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and crude oil
field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis exploration and development plans within
any budget.
We
may encounter an increase in the cost of securing needed drilling rigs, equipment, and supplies. Larger producers may be more
likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources
or can obtain access only at higher prices, its ability to convert oil reserves into cash flow could be delayed, and the cost
of producing from those oil reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect results of operations and financial
condition.  Our current drilling operations are limited, and the availability of essential drilling assets may not become
a risk factor until such time as we increase drilling operations.
We
have a limited customer base for its oil production due to its limited oil production and operating history.  The cost of
and difficulty in expanding the customer base for increased production from the Company Oil Rights is unknown.
We
can only determine the cost and difficulty of expanding our customer base based on actual oil production and then-current market
conditions and demand for oil.  As such, we cannot predict the cost and ease or difficulty of selling increased oil production
from the Company Oil Rights.  This unknown factor in commercially exploiting any increased oil production from the Company
Oil Rights increases the risk of investing in the shares of the Company because it renders uncertain a key factor in future profitability
of the Company.
25
Cyber-attacks
targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations
and, if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, our business may be adversely affected.
Our
business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production
activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial
and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our customers, employees and third-party partners.
The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats.
Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of
cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information,
customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication
interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly
or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion,
production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our
business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production,
non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our customer’s, supplier’s
or royalty owners’ data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting
us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore
our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.
In
addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting
against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. While we have not been subject to cybersecurity
challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing, we recognize the importance of developing, implementing
and maintaining cybersecurity measures to better safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity
and availability of our data. Our risk management team will work with our IT department to evaluate and address cybersecurity
risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. In the future, the Company will require the Board and employees
to complete cybersecurity training related to the physical security of assets, data privacy and other information security policies
and procedures. However, these actions may require us to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify
or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.
Risk
related to the Third-Party Transportation of Oil Production.
The
marketability of oil production will depend upon the availability, proximity, and capacity of transportation facilities owned
by third parties. Any oil production will be transported from the wellhead to gathering systems. The oil is then transported by
the purchaser by truck or other means to a transportation facility. We will not be able to control most of these third-party transportation
means and facilities, and access to them may be limited or denied. If in the future, the Company is unable, for any sustained
period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production-related difficulties, it may be
required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery
of the oil produced, would materially and adversely affect our efforts to attain or sustain revenues from operations and improved
future financial condition and results of operations.
Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements
Our
independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going
concern in its report on our audited financial statements.
On
a consolidated basis, the Company has incurred significant operating losses since inception and has a working capital deficit.
The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Because the Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations,
this raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company will need
to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically, the Company has raised capital
through an officer loan as an interim measure to finance working capital needs and will continue to raise additional capital through
the sale of common stock or other securities. The Company will be required to continue to do so until its consolidated operations
become profitable.  Our past efforts to raise working capital have been unsuccessful.
26
Although
our initial registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the Commission in August 2019, we were unable to sell
any shares and terminated said initial public offering. Our initial public offering commenced after October 9, 2020, following
the effectiveness of the Form S-1 registration statement; however, we only raised $53,000 in that initial public offering, which
was not sufficient, and closed in on May 31, 2021. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic and volatility of market price for oil in 2020
and 2021 further hampered efforts to raise additional working capital by creating economic uncertainty and heightened risks in
lending or investing in oil production. These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable
to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially and adversely
affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as
a viable entity, you would lose all or most of your investment in the Company.
We
do not have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance due to the high cost.
The
lack of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance hinders our ability to attract directors and officers. We intend
to seek to purchase directors’ and officers’ liability insurance if we have sufficient cash reserves from the net
proceeds of this Offering or future funding efforts.  Typically, such insurance costs $100,000 or more per annum, if available.
Further, directors’ and officers’ insurance require that the insured company cover the first $300,000 or more of costs
prior to insurance coverage occurring. This high deductible can be beyond the financial means of a small company and effectively
denies the insured company of the benefits of the insurance. If we do not have sufficient cash to purchase directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance, our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors will suffer, especially
considering the lack of a public market for the common stock and resulting inability to offer incentive compensation to directors
and officers. We may be unable to find an insurer willing to provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
since we are an early-stage development company with limited operating history and no revenue-generating operations.
Risks
Relating to Our Common Stock
Our
common stock is currently quoted on Pink Marketplace of OTC Markets; however, because our common stock was downgraded to Expert
Market, we need to submit a new application for Proprietary Quotations. We do not have an active, liquid trading market for our
common stock and may never develop it.
In
October 2021, our Common Stock became eligible for quotations on OTC Markets. Between October 2021 and July 2023, our stock was
quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace, which publishes brokerage quotations; however, because we were delinquent with our reporting
obligations and did not file our 2022 annual report and 2023 quarterly reports timely, our stock was downgraded to Expert Market
marketplace until we filed all required reports. While our common stock is currently trading again on the OTC Pink Marketplace,
because our stock was downgraded to Expert Market, our stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations, and all
quotes of our common stock reflect unsolicited customer orders. These unsolicited-only stocks have a higher risk of wider spread,
increased volatility, and price dislocations. To be eligible for public brokerage quotations and to provide continuous market
making, a market maker needs to submit a new application under SEC Rule15c2-11 which needs to be approved by FINRA. Even if our
stock becomes eligible for proprietary quotations, the trading on the OTC Pink marketplace is often thin and characterized by
wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
The securities market has from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the
operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price
of shares of our common stock.
27
In
the absence of an active trading market investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations, market
visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited, and a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive
effect on the market price for shares of our common stock. The lack of an active market impairs the ability of our stockholders
to sell their shares at a price that they consider reasonable and may also reduce the fair market value of the shares. Moreover,
OTC Markets is not a securities exchange, and trading of securities is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed
on a quotation system like Nasdaq or any other national stock exchange. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling
any shares of common stock.
Future
capital raises may dilute our existing shareholders’ ownership, the value of their equity securities and/or have other adverse
effects on our operations.
If
we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities by acquisition or by equity financing, our existing shareholders may
experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt instruments, these debt instruments could impose
significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations
and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products, or to grant licenses
on terms that are not favorable to us or could diminish the rights of our shareholders. Furthermore, if we offer to sell our shares
of common stock in subsequent offerings for a purchase price that is less than the purchase price of shares of common stock we
offered to our shareholders in the past, it may impact the value of equity securities of the shareholders that purchased it in
the past. In addition, the issuance of such additional shares may impact the ability of any investor to sell their shares once
such shares are eligible for sale.
There
is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends to our stockholders, which means that you could receive little or no return
on your investment.
Payment
of dividends from our earnings and profits may be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors. There is no assurance
that we will generate any distributable cash from operations. Our board may elect to retain cash for operating purposes, debt
retirement, or some other purpose. Consequently, you may receive little or no return on your investment.
“Penny
Stock” rules may make buying or selling our Common Stock difficult. Limitations upon Broker-Dealers Effecting Transactions
in “Penny Stocks”
Trading
in our Common Stock is subject to material limitations as a consequence of regulations that limit the activities of broker-dealers
effecting transactions in “penny stocks.” Pursuant to Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, our Common Stock is a “penny
stock” because it (i) is not listed on any national securities exchange (ii) has a market price of less than $5.00 per share,
and (iii) its issuer (the Company) has net tangible assets less than $2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in business for at least
three (3) years) or $5,000,000 (if the issuer has been in business for less than three (3) years). Rule 15g-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act imposes limitations upon trading activities on “penny stocks”, which makes selling our Common Stock
more difficult compared to selling securities that are not “penny stocks.” Rule 15a-9 restricts the solicitation of
sales of “penny stocks” by broker-dealers unless the broker first (i) obtains from the purchaser information concerning
his financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives, (ii) reasonably determines that the purchaser has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial matters that the person is capable of evaluating the risks of investing in “penny
stocks”, and (iii) delivers and receives back from the purchaser a manually signed written statement acknowledging the purchaser’s
investment experience and financial sophistication.
Rules
15g-2 through 15g-6 promulgated under the Exchange Act require broker-dealers who engage in transactions in “penny stocks”
first to provide their customers with a series of disclosures and documents, including (i) a standardized risk disclosure document
identifying the risks inherent in investing in “penny stocks”, (ii) all compensation received by the broker-dealer
in connection with the transaction, (iii) current quotation prices and other relevant market data, and (iv) monthly account statements
reflecting the fair market value of the securities.
There
can be no assurance that any broker-dealer which initiates quotations for the Common Stock will continue to do so, and the loss
of any such broker-dealer likely would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.
FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
In
addition to the “penny stock” rules described below, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an
investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that
customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other
information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers
to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse
effect on the market for our shares.
28
Because
our Common Stock is deemed a low-priced “penny stock,” it will be cumbersome for brokers and dealers to trade in our
Common Stock, making the market for our Common Stock less liquid and negatively affecting the price of our stock. We will be subject
to certain provisions of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the “penny stock” rules as defined in Rule 3a51-1.
A penny stock is generally defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. Since our stock is deemed to be a penny stock, trading is subject to additional sales practice requirements of broker-dealers.
These require a broker-dealer to:
●
Deliver to the customer,
and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;
●
Disclose certain
price information about the stock;
●
Disclose the amount
of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;
●
Send monthly statements
to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and
●
In some circumstances,
approve the purchaser’s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with the information
specified in the rules.
Consequently,
penny stock rules and FINRA rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market
in our Common Stock. Also, prospective investors may not want to get involved with the additional administrative requirements,
which may have a material adverse effect on the trading of our shares.
We
are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act of 2012 and a “smaller reporting company” and, as
a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies,
our Common Stock may be less attractive to investors.
We
are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from
various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies”
including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely
on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market
for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards.
We
will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (i) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary
of the date of the completion of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross
revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer”
as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates
exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have
issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
29
Even
after we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company,”
which would allow us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including, among
other things, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
presenting only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements.
Our
status as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when
we need it.
Because
of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company” and because we
will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive
to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare
our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other
companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on
which they are made, except as required by applicable law.
Management’s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon and should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K/A.
Overview
We
were incorporated on November 13, 2017, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to acquire, fund, and operate oil exploration
and production from assets in the Gulf States Drill Region. We are an early-stage corporation seeking to become an independent
energy company focused on the acquisition and subsequent exploitation and development of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf
States Drill Region.
Since
our inception, we have incurred operating losses. Prior to the Barrister Acquisition, we had not generated positive cash flows
from operations, and while after the Barrister Acquisition, we started to generate revenue, there are no assurances that we will
be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing for the development and commercialization of our proposed oil exploration
and production business. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to
incur expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to implement our business plan.  Due to its limited
revenues, the Acquisitions do not remedy substantial doubts about our ability as a going concern. The Company has been unable
to raise additional capital as of the date of this Annual Report, other than personal loans by Jeffrey J. Guzy, our Chief Financial
Officer, and $53,000 raised in the initial public offering in 2020.
Reserve
engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data, and price and cost assumptions
made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing, and production activities may justify revisions
of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production
and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil that are ultimately
recovered.  When we acquire oil exploration and production leases and rights, we will use oil reserve reports as one factor
in deciding whether to drill in the property of a specific oil lease or right.  Reserve
estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying
assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of oil from a drilling site.
33
Risks
and Uncertainties
Oil
and natural gas prices have and may continue to be volatile. Recessionary concerns have placed some downward pressure on commodity
prices, causing oil and gas prices to decline in the first quarter of 2023 from their earlier highs in 2022. Although supply has
increased throughout the last three years, there is still an element of volatility and uncertainty that we expect to continue
at least for the near-term and possibly longer, in part by the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian military conflict on global commodity
and financial markets, and the associated effect of trade sanctions on imports of oil and natural gas from Russia. This volatility
could negatively impact future prices for oil, natural gas, petroleum products and industrial products.

Revenues
Revenues
were $971,686 for the year ended December 31, 2024, and $927,983 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company is an early-stage
company and began producing significant revenue in 2023. The increase in revenue of $43,703 is attributable to the acquisition
of additional mineral and oil and gas interests during 2024.
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses consisted primarily of accounting and audit fees, legal and professional services fees, and payroll-related
expenses. General and administrative expenses were $919,994 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $1,038,473 in the
same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 11.4% or $118,479. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in management
fees.
Lease
Operating Expenses
Lease
operating expenses were $355,644 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $248,642 in the same period in 2023. The increase
in lease operating expenses of 43.0% or $107,002 was primarily driven by the 2024 acquisition of additional mineral and oil and
gas interests and the operation of those interests.
Loss
from Operations
Total
operating loss was $1,608,945 for the year ended December 31, 2024, and $1,627,962 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change
in loss was primarily driven by the decrease in general and administrative expenses, offset by the increase in lease operating
expenses.
Other
Expense, Net
Other
expense, net was ($901) for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to ($1,940) for the same period in 2023. The change in
other expense, net, was attributable to an increase in interest income.
35
Net
Loss
As
a result of the above factors, there was a net loss of $1,609,846 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss
of $1,629,902 in the same period of 2023.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Sources
of Liquidity
The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46,738 at December 31, 2024. The Company has incurred net operating losses and operating
cash flow deficits since inception, continuing through the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Since inception,
the primary sources of financing have been a combination of loans or contributions of Jeffrey J. Guzy, an officer and director
of the Company, and $53,000 raised in the public offering.  This limited funding has been inadequate as of the date of this
Annual Report to fund our business strategy. The Company has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any
future plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing.
Funding
Requirements
The
Company believes that its working capital on hand, as of the date of this report, will not be sufficient to fund its plan of operations
over the next 12 months. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial revenues, it expects to continue relying
on a combination of equity offerings and debt financings to fund ongoing operations. To the extent that the Company raises additional
capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, the ownership interest of the Company may be materially diluted, and the
terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of the Company’s
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities
or that it will be able to arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities.
Debt
or equity financing arrangements may not be available to us or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Based on prior experience
in seeking funding for drilling on properties without any significant oil production, funding for drilling is challenging to obtain
at all or on affordable terms. Our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired by many factors outside of our control,
including the capital markets (both generally and in the crude oil industry in particular), our lack of operating history, the
location of our proposed or future crude oil properties and prices of crude oil on the commodities markets (which will influence
the amount of asset-based financing available to us) and other factors. Further, if oil prices on the commodities markets decline,
our revenues from any exploitation of the Company Oil Rights will likely decrease, and such decreased revenues may increase our
requirements for capital. The Company may continue to incur substantial costs in the future in connection with raising capital
to fund our business, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing
and distribution expenses, and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with
certain securities we may issue, which may adversely affect our financial condition.
If
the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements sufficient to satisfy
its long-term capital requirements, together with its revenues from any acquired operations, it may be required to reduce operating
costs, which are already minimal and delay, reduce or eliminate its acquisition and development activities. That reduction could
jeopardize the Company’s future strategic initiatives and business plans. The Company may be required to sell some or all
of its acquired properties (which could be on unfavorable terms), seek joint ventures with one or more strategic partners, strategic
acquisitions, and other strategic alternatives, cease our operations, sell or merge our business, or file a petition for bankruptcy
(either liquidation or reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Any of these actions could result in investors in the common
stock losing their investment or failing to realize any appreciation in the common stock from the purchase price.

Net
cash from operating activities is derived from net loss from operations adjusted for non-cash items, changes in accounts receivables
balances, prepaid expenses, accounts payables, and accrued expenses. For the period ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in
operating activities was $19,187 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $48,046 for the period ended December
31, 2023. The net decrease was primarily attributable to a net $317,004 decrease in the non-cash adjustment for common stock issued
for services and salaries. This change was offset by the net increase in accounts receivable during the period ended December
31, 2024.
Net
cash used in investing activities was $0 for both the periods ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.
Total
net cash used in financing activities was $9,983 for the period ended December 31, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities
was $9,888 for the periods ended December 31, 2023. The net decrease was due to the decrease in payments made of the SBA PPP loan.
37
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following
the date of these financial statements. On a consolidated basis, we have incurred significant operating losses since inception.
Because we do not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations, this
raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, we will need to raise additional funds and
are currently exploring sources of financing. Historically, we have raised capital through private offerings of debt and equity
and officer loans to finance working capital needs. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to raise additional
capital through the sale of common stock or other securities or obtain short-term loans.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our financial statements.
The preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial
statements. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable
at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances, weather, politics, global economics,
mechanical problems, general business conditions, and other factors. Our significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 1
to our financial statements included in this Annual Report. We have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular
importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant
judgment by our management.
Revenue
Recognition. In January 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Codification
Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The timing of recognizing revenue from the sale of produced crude oil
and natural gas was not changed as a result of adopting ASC 606. The Company predominantly derives its revenue from the sale of
produced crude oil and natural gas. The contractual performance obligation is satisfied when the product is delivered to the purchaser.
Revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser. The Company receives payment within one month
after pickup. The transaction price includes variable consideration as product pricing is based on published market prices and
reduced for contract-specified differentials. The new guidance regarding ASC 606 does not require that the transaction price be
fixed or stated in the contract. Estimating the variable consideration does not require significant judgment. Revenue is recognized
net of royalties due to third parties in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those products. See Note 2 of our financial statements for additional information.
38
Successful
Efforts Method of Accounting. We account for oil and natural gas properties in accordance with the successful efforts
method. Under this method, all acquisition costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a unit-of-production basis
over the remaining life of the proved reserves. All development costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a
unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of the proved developed reserves. Costs of retired, sold, or abandoned properties
that constitute a part of an amortization base are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to accumulated depreciation, depletion,
and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production amortization rate, in which case a gain or loss
is recognized in the current period. Gains or losses from the disposal of other properties are recognized in the current period.
For assets acquired, we base the capitalized cost on the fair value at the acquisition date. We expense expenditures for maintenance
and repairs necessary to maintain properties in operating condition, as well as annual lease rentals, as they are incurred. Estimated
dismantlement and abandonment costs are capitalized at their estimated net present value and amortized over the remaining
lives of the related assets. Interest is capitalized only during the periods in which these assets are brought to their intended
use. We only capitalize the interest on borrowed funds related to our share of costs associated with qualifying capital expenditures.
Impairment
of Oil and Natural Gas Properties.  We evaluate the impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties generally
on a field-by-field basis or at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable, whenever events or changes in circumstance
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We reduce the carrying values of proved properties to fair value when
the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value. We measure the fair values of proved properties
using valuation techniques consistent with the income approach, converting future cash flows to a single discounted amount. Significant
inputs used to determine the fair values of proved properties include estimates of (i) reserves; (ii) future operating and development
costs; (iii) future commodity prices; and (iv) a risk-adjusted discount rate. These inputs require significant judgments and estimates
by our management at the time of the valuation. The most significant financial statement effect from a change in our oil and gas
reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be the DD&A rate.
An
impairment may not be reversed in future periods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling.
Our
estimates of reserves and future cash flow as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 were prepared using an average price equal to the
unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month periods ended December 31,
2024, and 2023, respectively, in accordance with SEC guidelines.  As of December 31, 2024, our reserves are based on an SEC
average price of $73.68 per Bbl of WTI oil posted and $2.013 per MCF natural gas. As of December 31, 2023, our reserves are based
on an SEC average price of $75.81 per Bbl of WTI oil posted and $0 per MCF natural gas. Prices are adjusted by local field and
lease level differentials and are held constant for the life of reserves in accordance with SEC guidelines.
39
Income
Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the
carrying amount in our financial statements. This difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when
the reported amount of the asset or liability is settled. Since our tax returns are filed after the financial statements are prepared,
estimates are required in valuing tax assets and liabilities. We record adjustments to the actual values in the period we file
our tax returns.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
CoJax
Oil and Gas Corporation
Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CoJax Oil and Gas Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024
and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, has negative cash flows
from operating activities, and is dependent upon future issuances of equity or other financings to fund ongoing operations all
of which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters
are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matter
The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that
are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Oil
and gas properties
As
described in Notes 3, 5 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using
the successful efforts method of accounting which requires management to estimate reserve volumes and future net revenues to assess
if there are indications the carrying value of certain properties exceed the fair value and if so, determine the fair value of
its oil and gas properties. To estimate the volume of reserves and future net revenues, management makes significant estimates
and assumptions, and rely on third party experts. In addition, the estimation of reserves is also impacted by management’s
judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with reserves to determine if wells are expected,
with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the pricing assumptions required in the impairment evaluation and measurements.
We identified the evaluation of oil and gas properties as a critical audit matter.
Our
audit procedures related to the estimation of proved reserves included the following, among others.
•
We
evaluated the level of knowledge, skill and ability of the Company’s reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship
to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate
the Company’s proved reserves, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company’s reservoir engineering specialists.
•
We
tested the accuracy of the Company’s impairment evaluation and measurement that included these proved reserve reports.
•
We
evaluated sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine reserve volumes and other cash flow inputs and assumptions derived
from the Company’s accounting records. These assumptions included historical pricing differentials, current and future
operating costs, estimated future capital costs, and ownership interests.

NOTE
1 – ORGANIZATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization
CoJax
Oil & Gas Corporation, a Virginia corporation (“Company”), was incorporated on November 13, 2017.  The Company
is based in Arlington, Virginia, with a wholly owned subsidiary, Barrister Energy LLC (‘Barrister Energy’), registered
in Mississippi and based in Laurel, Mississippi.
Nature
of Operations
The
Company is a growing U.S. energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of lower-risk onshore oil and gas-producing
properties within the Southeastern U.S. The Company’s focused growth strategy relies primarily on leveraging management’s
expertise to acquire both operated and non-operated interests in producing properties with the goal of assembling a large oil
and gas portfolio. Through this strategy of acquisition of operated and non-operated properties, the Company has the unique ability
to benefit from the technical and scientific expertise of world-class exploration and production (“E&P”) companies
operating in the area.
Since
the company’s inception, it has been engaged in organizational activities and had limited revenue-generating operations
prior to the periods covered by this current report.  The company has begun to acquire assignments of hydrocarbon revenues
and underlying oil and gas exploration and production rights as covered by this current report. The company runs all operations
of its current acquisitions through Barrister Energy LLC, the operational subsidiary.
The
Company focuses on the acquisition of and exploitation of upstream energy assets, specifically targeting select oil and gas mineral
interests.  These acquisitions are structured primarily as acquisitions of leases, working interests, real property interests
and mineral rights and royalties and are generally not regarded as the acquisition of securities, but rather real property interests.
As an owner, the Company has the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds
of the sale thereof). As an owner, the Company also has an obligation for its share of lease operating costs.
On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak and any related
adverse public health developments, have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to
an economic downturn. The impact on the Company has not been significant, but management continues to monitor the situation.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“US GAAP”), which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern.
NOTE
2 – GOING CONCERN DISCLOSURE
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern that
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan, raise any additional capital, or secure the additional financing
necessary to implement its current operating plan. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
F 47
The
Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, has negative
cash flows from operating activities, and is dependent upon future issuances of equity or other financings to fund ongoing operations,
all of which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve
months from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing from stockholders or other
sources to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management
has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by
equity financing and/or related party advances, however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available or on acceptable
terms, if at all.
NOTE
3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas of estimate include
the impairment of assets and rates for amortization, accrued liabilities, future income tax obligations, and the inputs used in
calculating stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates and would affect future results of operations
and cash flows.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Reclassifications include combining
or further disaggregation of certain line items in the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, and
consolidated statements of cash flows. Such reclassifications had no significant impact on our reported net loss, current assets,
total assets, current liabilities, total liabilities, shareholders’ equity or cash flows.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
At December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.
F 48
Oil
and Gas Producing Activities
The
Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities. Under this method, the costs of productive
exploratory wells, all development wells, related asset retirement obligation assets, and productive leases are capitalized and
amortized, principally by field, on a units-of-production basis over the life of the remaining proved reserves. Exploration costs,
including personnel costs, geological and geophysical expenses, and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense
as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not
to have found reserves in commercial quantities.
Estimates
of oil and gas reserves, as determined by independent petroleum engineers, are continually subject to revision based on price,
production history and other factors. Depletion expense, which is computed based on the units of production method, could be significantly
impacted by changes in such estimates. Additionally, US GAAP requires that if the expected future undiscounted cash flows from
an asset are less than its carrying cost, that asset must be written down to its fair market value. As the fair market value of
an oil and gas property will usually be significantly less than the total undiscounted future net revenues expected from that
asset, slight changes in the estimates used to determine future net revenues from an asset could lead to the necessity of recording
a significant impairment of that asset.
Unproved
oil and gas properties will be assessed annually to determine whether they have been impaired by the drilling of dry holes on
or near the related acreage or other circumstances, which may indicate a decline in value. When impairment occurs, a loss will
be recognized. When leases for unproved properties expire, the costs thereof, net of any related allowance for impairment, will
be removed from the accounts and charged to expense.
The
Company will review its proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a
decline in the recoverability of its carrying value may have occurred. It estimates the undiscounted future net cash flows of
its oil and natural gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural
gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value.
During
the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded impairments of $922,932 and $875,400, respectively, on oil and
gas properties.
Long-Lived
Assets
The
Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets according to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment”. ASC
360 clarifies the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, including the
disposal of business segments and major lines of business. Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair
value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by
discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses
on long-lived assets during the years ending December 31, 2024, and 2023.
F 49
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company had no financial instruments for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for the year ending December 31, 2023.
ASC
820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources
(observable inputs) and (2) a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on
the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels,
which give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities;
Level
2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
(e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation
or other means; and
Level
3 – Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as
of December 31, 2024, and 2023. The respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated
their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
F 50
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company accounts for revenue under ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Under ASC 606, oil and natural
gas sales revenues are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, the performance obligations under
the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied and collectability is reasonably assured. All the Company’s oil
and natural gas sales are made under contracts with customers. The performance obligations for the Company’s contracts with
customers are satisfied at a point in time through the delivery of oil and natural gas to its customers. Accordingly, the Company’s
contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities. The Company typically receives payment within 90 days of the month
of delivery. The Company’s contracts for oil and natural gas sales are standard industry contracts that include variable
consideration based on the monthly index price and adjustments that may include counterparty-specific provisions related to volumes,
price differentials, discounts, and other adjustments and deductions.

Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable consists of oil and natural gas receivables. Ongoing evaluations of collectability are performed and an allowance for
potential credit losses is provided against the portion of accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible. The Company
did not recognize any write-offs during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023. The allowance for doubtful accounts is $0
as of December 31, 2024, and 2023.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for Stock-Based Compensation under ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, which addresses
the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus
on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Generally accepted accounting
principles require measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after
the grant date must be recognized.
The
Company issues stock to consultants for various services. The costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of
the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to
earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete. The Company recognized
consulting expense and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services.
Income
Taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for under ASC 740, using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method,
future tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the amounts reported in the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted income tax rates expected to apply when the asset
is realized, or the liability settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on future income tax liabilities and assets
is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. Future income tax assets are recognized to the extent that they
are considered more likely than not to be realized.
F 51
ASC
740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. This standard
requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based
on the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position
to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.
Because
of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition
and measurement standards established by ASC 740 and concluded that it had no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024,
or as of December 31, 2023.
Basic
and Diluted Income per Share
The
Company computes income per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share", which requires the presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Basic
EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock
price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or
warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023,
the Company had 0 and 1,050,000 potentially dilutive common shares outstanding, respectively.
Asset
Retirement Obligations
The
Company records the estimated fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible, long-lived assets in the period
in which they are incurred. When a liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost is
depleted over the useful life of the related asset.
Revisions
to estimated asset retirement obligations will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability.
Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss.
The Company’s asset retirement obligation relates to the plugging, dismantling, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities
of its oil and gas properties.
Asset
retirement obligations are estimated at the present value of expected future net cash flows and are discounted using the Company’s
credit adjusted risk-free rate. The Company uses unobservable inputs in the estimation of asset retirement obligations that include,
but are not limited to: costs of labor, costs of materials, profits on costs of labor and materials, the effect of inflation on
estimated costs, and discount rate. Due to the subjectivity of assumptions and the relative long lives of the Company’s
leases, the costs to ultimately retire the Company’s obligations may vary significantly from prior estimates. Assumptions
used in determining estimates are reviewed annually.
F 52
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Our
revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of oil and natural gas. However, based on the
current demand for crude oil and natural gas and the fact that alternative purchasers are readily available, we believe that the
loss of our marketing agents and/or any of the purchasers identified by our marketing agents would not have a long-term material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of international operations. The continued economic disruption resulting from
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a potential global recession, and other varying macroeconomic conditions could materially
impact the Company's business in future periods. Any potential disruption will depend on the duration and intensity of these events,
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
Segment
Information
The
Company operates in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and production of oil and natural gas properties
in the Gulf States Drilling Region.
The
Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the President and Chief Executive Officer as he maintains
responsibility for assessment of the Company’s performance and decision making regarding resource allocation. Consolidated
net income (loss) is the performance measure used by the CODM to evaluate the segment’s performance and allocate capital
and to monitor budget versus actual results. The information regularly provided to the CODM on the segment’s revenues and
significant expenses aligns with the categories presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Furthermore, the segment’s
assets are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total assets.
NOTE
4 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures
about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker and included in each reported
measure of segment profit or loss. Additionally, the ASU expanded interim disclosure segments. The ASU was adopted by the Company
during the year ended December 31, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Segment
Information as disclosed with Note 3 for additional information regarding the updates made.
Management
does not believe any other recently issued accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s
present or future financial statements.

7 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
For
the years ending December 31, 2024, and 2023, in addition to the related party loans payable (NOTE 6), the following related party
transactions occurred between the Company’s directors or executive officers or any person nominated or chosen by the Company
to become a director or executive officer:
F 55
On
January 25, 2023, the Company issued 25,000 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock to Jeffrey J. Guzy, the Company’s
CFO, and 25,000 shares of Series A convertible stock to Wm. Barrett Wellman, the Company’s former CFO. Each share is convertible
at the option of the holder to ten (10) shares of common stock. The total fair value of $1,065,000 ($21.30 per share) was recorded
as part of accrued salaries and payroll taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 as service was provided in that year. The accrual
was reversed upon issuance of the shares in January 2023. The fair value was based on the value assigned to common stock ($2.13
per share) multiplied by 10.
On
February 14, 2023, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Guzy (the “Guzy 2023 Employment Agreement”),
pursuant to which Mr. Guzy continued serving the Company as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Company. That
employment agreement was terminated on January 10, 2024, upon resignation of Mr. Guzy from these positions. On the same date,
the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Guzy in connection with his appointment as Chief Financial officer.
On
March 13, 2023, Mr. Wellman’s Employment Agreement was extended to a termination date of August 16, 2024. The Employment
Agreement was terminated on January 10, 2024, upon resignation of Mr. Wellman as Chief Financial Officer.
Effective
as of January 10, 2024, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) increased the size of the Board from two
to three directors and appointed William R. Downs to the Board.
On
January 10, 2024, Jeffrey J. Guzy resigned from serving as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board. Immediately
upon Mr. Guzy’s resignation from these offices, Mr. Downs was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman
of the Board. Also on January 10, 2024, Wm. Barrett Wellman resigned as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company.
Effective immediately upon Mr. Wellman’s resignation, the Board appointed Mr. Guzy as the Company’s Chief Financial
officer and Secretary.
On
January 10, 2024, the Company issued 100,000 common shares at $0.99 per share to William R. Downs in connection with his appointment
as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer. The issuance of 100,000 shares was recognized at the share price on the date
of the employment agreement.
On
January 26, 2024, Mr. Guzy and Mr. Wellman, being the holders of all of the Company’s Series A Stock converted all 105,000
shares issued and outstanding into common shares at a conversion rate of one to ten. The conversion occurred at the rate specified
in the initial issuance agreement and therefore no gain or loss was recognized on the conversion. In connection with the exercise
of the conversion option, the Company issued 575,000 and 475,000 common shares to Jeffrey J. Guzy and Wm. Barrett Wellman, respectively.

Stock
The
holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends equal to the amount of the dividend or distribution per share of
common stock payable multiplied by the number of shares of common stock the shares of Series A preferred shares held by such holder
are convertible into. Each Series A preferred shares is convertible into ten common shares.
The
Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock as permanent equity in the consolidated financial statements as the terms do not
provide for an obligation to buy back the shares in exchange for cash or other assets of the Company. The shares are not considered
debt under ASC 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” as the shares do not represent an obligation that must
or may be settled with a variable number of shares. No other redemption features exist within the terms of the instrument.

Company provides for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Deferred income
taxes arise from the differences in the recognition of income and expenses for tax purposes. There were no deferred tax assets
or liabilities at December 31, 2024, and 2023.
Management
has reviewed the provisions regarding the assessment of their valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and based on those criteria
determined that it would not have sufficient taxable income to realize those assets. Therefore, management has assessed the realization
of the deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized and has provided
a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.
The
Company recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would
more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the
amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
The
Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of Virginia. The tax regulations within each
jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply.
The Company is not presently undergoing any tax audits.
The
Company will apply the federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forward in FY 2024 and later years.
On
December 22, 2017, the United States Government passed new tax legislation that, among other provisions, will lower the corporate
tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income
we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses previously accumulated and results
in a revaluation of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet. Given that the deferred tax assets are offset by a full
valuation allowance, these changes have no net effect on the Company’s financial position and net loss. However, when we
become profitable, we will receive a reduced benefit from such deferred tax assets.
A

totaling $4,825,047 and $4,273,108 respectively which are available to reduce taxable income in future taxation years.

by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), our third-party independent reserve engineers. In preparing its reports,
NSAI evaluated properties representing all of our proved reserves at December 31, 2024, and 2023 in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our estimated net proved
reserves in the table below do not include probable or possible reserves and do not in any way include or reflect our commodity
derivatives.

The
table above values oil and natural gas reserve quantities as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, assuming constant realized prices
of $73.68 and $75.81 per barrel of oil and $2.013 and $0 per Mcf of natural gas, respectively. Under SEC guidelines, these prices
represent the average prices per barrel of oil and per Mcf of natural gas at the beginning of each month in the 12-month period
prior to the end of the reporting period, after adjustment to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials.
Standardized
Measure
The
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  Such assumptions include using 12-month average prices for oil and gas,
based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period, and year-end costs for estimated future development and
production expenditures to produce year-end estimated proved reserves.
Discounted
future net cash flows are calculated using a 10% rate. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying year-end statutory
rates to future pre-tax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets and applicable tax credits.
The
estimated well abandonment costs are deducted from the standardized measure using year-end costs and discounted at 10%.  Such
abandonment costs are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, using estimated values as the projected abandonment
date and discounted using a risk-adjusted rate when the well is drilled or acquired.
The
standardized measure does not represent management’s estimate of the Company’s future cash flows or the value of proved
oil and gas reserves.  Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the
calculations.  Furthermore, prices used to determine the standardized measure are influenced by supply and demand as
affected by recent economic conditions and other factors and may not be the most representative in estimating future revenues
or reserve data.
The
table below reflects the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to the Company’s interest in proved
reserves.

13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The
Company has evaluated all events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were
issued to determine if they must be reported. Management determined that there were no reportable subsequent events to be disclosed
beyond the following:
F 62
ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In
designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting described below.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its principal executive and principal financial
officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on
the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, was not effective.
63
A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”),
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.
The
ineffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses:
●Inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;
●Lack
of formal policies and procedures;
●Lack
of a functioning audit committee and independent directors on the Company’s board of directors to oversee financial reporting
responsibilities; and
●Lack
of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks on a timely manner.
Management’s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness
Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material
weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions
planned include:
●Continue
to search for and evaluate qualified independent outside directors;
●Identify
gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company;
and
●Continue
to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on
existing controls and procedures.
We
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believe that these remediation efforts will deliver improvements
in our control environment. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach and
the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking
further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company
to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in
our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2018
Equity Incentive Plan
Our
Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan on December 31, 2018 (“2018 Plan”), which
replaced the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”) that was approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders
on January 2, 2018.  The Board of Directors terminated the 2017 Plan on December 31, 2018.  No options or awards were
granted under the 2017 Plan.
No
options or other incentive compensation has been granted as of December 31, 2024.
70
The
following is a summary of the 2018 Plan:
2018
Plan Purpose. The 2018 Plan will allow us to grant equity awards, including performance awards, to incentivize high levels
of performance and productivity by individuals who provide services to us and to further align the interests of our employees
with those of CoJax and its stockholders. The use of our common stock as part of our compensation program is intended to foster
a pay-for-performance culture that is an essential element of our overall compensation philosophy. Our equity will be used to
retain our officers and other employees and promote a focus on sustained enhancement through improved performance. The 2018 Plan
is intended to be “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section
162(m)”), to be exempt from the tax deduction limits of Section 162(m) if they meet the other requirements of Section 162(m).
2018
Plan Administration. The Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when formed by the
Board of Directors, has the authority to administer our 2018 Plan. Subject to the terms of the 2018 Plan, the Board of Directors
or the authorized board committee, referred to as the “plan administrator,” determines recipients, dates of grant,
the numbers and types of stock awards to be granted, and the terms and conditions of the stock awards, including the period of
their exercisability and vesting schedule applicable to a stock award. Subject to the limitations set forth below, the plan administrator
will also determine the exercise price, strike price, or purchase price of awards granted and the types of consideration to be
paid for the award. The plan administrator has the authority to modify outstanding awards under our 2018 Plan. Subject to the
terms of our 2018 Plan, the plan administrator has the authority, without stockholder approval, to reduce the exercise, purchase
or strike price of any outstanding stock award, cancel any outstanding stock award in exchange for new stock awards, cash, or
other consideration, or take any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles; provided,
that, stockholders must approve any repricing of SAR’s.
2018
Plan Share Reserve.   Three million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under grants or awards made
pursuant to the 2018 Plan.   If a stock award granted under our 2018 Plan expires or otherwise terminates without being
exercised in full, or is settled in cash, the shares of our common stock not acquired pursuant to the stock award again will become
available for subsequent issuance under our 2018 Plan. The following types of shares under our 2018 Plan may become available
for the grant of new stock awards under our 2018 Plan: (1) shares that are forfeited to or repurchased by us before becoming
fully vested; (2) shares withheld to satisfy income or employment withholding taxes; or (3) shares used to pay the exercise
or purchase price of a stock award. Shares issued under our 2018 Plan may be previously unissued shares or reacquired shares bought
by us on the open market.
2018
Plan Stock Awards.  Our 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (“Code”)), non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
or SARs, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance-based stock awards and other forms of equity compensation,
which are collectively referred to as stock awards. Our 2018 Plan also provides for the grant of performance cash awards. Incentive
stock options may be granted only to employees. All other awards may be granted to employees, including officers, and to non-employee
directors and consultants.  Incentive and non-statutory stock options are evidenced by stock option agreements adopted
by the plan administrator. The plan administrator determines the exercise price for a stock option, within the terms and conditions
of our 2018 Plan, provided that the exercise price of a stock option generally cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under our 2018 Plan vest at the rate specified by the plan administrator.
The plan administrator determines the term of stock options granted under our 2018 Plan, up to a maximum of ten years. Unless
the terms of an option holder’s stock option agreement provide otherwise, if an option holder’s service relationship
with us, or any of our affiliates, ceases for any reason other than disability, death, or cause, the option holder may generally
exercise any vested options for three months following the cessation of service. The option term will automatically be extended
in the event that exercise of the option following such a termination of service is prohibited by applicable securities laws or
our insider trading policy.
71
Acceptable
consideration for the purchase of common stock issued upon the exercise of a stock option will be determined by the plan administrator
and may include (1) cash, check, bank draft, or money order, (2) a broker-assisted cashless exercise, (3) the tender
of shares of our common stock previously owned by the option holder, (4) a net exercise of the option if it is a nonqualified
stock option, and (5) other legal consideration approved by the plan administrator.
Unless
the plan administrator provides otherwise, options generally are not transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution,
or pursuant to a domestic relations order.
Tax
Limitations on Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of our common
stock with respect to incentive stock options that are exercisable for the first time by an option holder during any calendar
year under all of our stock plans, may not exceed $100,000. Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit will be treated
as nonqualified stock options. No incentive stock option may be granted to any person who, at the time of the grant, owns or is
deemed to own stock possessing more than 10% of our total combined voting power or that of any of our affiliates unless (1) the
option exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date of grant and (2) the
term of the incentive stock option does not exceed five years from the date of grant.
Restricted
Stock Awards. Restricted stock awards are evidenced by restricted stock award agreements adopted by the plan administrator.
Restricted stock awards may be granted in consideration for (1) cash, check, bank draft, or money order, (2) services
rendered to us or our affiliates, or (3) any other form of legal consideration. Common stock acquired under a restricted
stock award may, but need not, be subject to a share repurchase option in our favor in accordance with a vesting schedule as determined
by the plan administrator. Rights to acquire shares under a restricted stock award may be transferred only upon such terms and
conditions as set by the plan administrator. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, restricted stock
unit awards that have not vested will be forfeited upon the participant’s cessation of continuous service for any reason.
Restricted
Stock Unit Awards.  Restricted stock unit awards are evidenced by restricted stock unit award agreements adopted by the
plan administrator. Restricted stock unit awards may be granted in consideration for any form of legal consideration or no consideration.
A restricted stock unit award may be settled by cash, delivery of stock, a combination of cash and stock as deemed appropriate
by the plan administrator, or in any other form of the consideration set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement. Additionally,
dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares covered by a restricted stock unit award. Rights under a restricted
stock units award may be transferred only upon such terms and conditions as set by the plan administrator. Restricted stock unit
awards may be subject to vesting as determined by the plan administrator. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable award
agreement, restricted stock units that have not vested will be forfeited upon the participant’s cessation of continuous
service for any reason.
72
Stock
Appreciation Rights or “SARs.” SARs are evidenced by SAR grant agreements adopted by the plan administrator. The
plan administrator determines the strike price for a SAR, which generally cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of
our common stock on the date of grant. Upon the exercise of a SAR, we will pay the participant an amount in cash or stock equal
to (1) the excess of the per-share fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the strike price, multiplied
by (2) the number of shares of common stock with respect to which the SAR is exercised. A SAR granted under our 2018 Plan
vests at the rate specified in the SAR agreement as determined by the plan administrator.
The
plan administrator determines the term of SARs granted under our 2018 Plan, up to a maximum of ten years. Unless the terms of
a participant’s SAR agreement provides otherwise, if a participant’s service relationship with us or any of our affiliates
ceases for any reason other than cause, disability, or death, the participant may generally exercise any vested SAR for a period
of three months following the cessation of service. The SARs’ term will be further extended in the event that applicable
securities laws prohibit the exercise of the SAR following such a termination of service. In no event may a SAR be exercised beyond
the expiration of its term.
Unless
the plan administrator provides otherwise, SARs generally are not transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution,
or pursuant to a domestic relations order. A SAR holder may designate a beneficiary, however, who may exercise the SAR following
the holder’s death.
Performance
Awards. Our 2018 Plan permits the grant of performance-based stock and cash awards. Our compensation committee can structure
such awards so that stock or cash will be issued or paid pursuant to such award only after the achievement of certain pre-established
performance goals during a designated performance period. The plan administrator determines the performance goals. The performance
goals may be based on company-wide performance or performance of one or more business units, divisions, affiliates, or business
segments. They may be either absolute or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companies or the performance of
one or more relevant indices.
Other
Stock Awards. The plan administrator may grant other awards based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock.
The plan administrator will set the number of shares under the stock award and all other terms and conditions of such awards.
Changes
to Capital Structure. In the event that there is a specified type of change in our capital structure, such as a stock
split or recapitalization, appropriate adjustments will be made to (1) the class and a maximum number of shares reserved
for issuance under our 2018 Plan, (2) the class and a maximum number of shares by which the share reserve may increase each
year automatically, (3) the class and a maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock
options and (4) the class and number of shares and exercise price, strike price or purchase price, if applicable, of all
outstanding stock awards.
Change
in Control. The plan administrator may provide, in an individual award agreement or any other written agreement between
a participant and us, that the stock award will be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability or settlement
in the event of a change in control. Under our 2018 Plan, a change in control is generally (1) the acquisition by a person
or entity of more than 50% of our combined voting power other than by merger, consolidation, or similar transaction, (2) a
consummated merger, consolidation, or similar transaction immediately after which our stockholders cease to own more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the surviving entity or (3) a consummated sale, lease or exclusive license or other disposition
of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets.
73
Amendment
and Termination. Board of Directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our 2018 Plan, provided that such
action does not materially impair the existing rights of any participant without such participant’s written consent and
provided further that certain types of amendments will require the approval of stockholders. No incentive stock options may be
granted after the tenth anniversary of the date that the Board of Directors adopts the 2018 Plan.
Outstanding
Equity Awards
There
were no outstanding equity awards to our Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2024.
ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
The
following table lists, as of the date of this Annual Report, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by (i) each
person, entity or group (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) known to the Company
to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each of our directors (iii) each of our Named
Executive Officers and (iv) all executive officers and directors as a group. Information relating to beneficial ownership of common
stock by our principal stockholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using “beneficial
ownership” concepts under the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security
if that person directly or indirectly has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the
security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. The person is also
deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days.
Under the SEC rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed
to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary interest. Except as noted below, each
person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned and each stockholder’s address
is c/o CoJax Oil and Gas Corporation, 4830 Line Avenue, Suite 152, Shreveport, Louisiana, 71106. The percentages below are calculated

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
In
addition to the executive officer compensation arrangements discussed in “Executive Compensation,” below we describe
transactions since incorporation, in which we have been a participant, in which the amount involved in the transaction is material
to our Company, and in which any of the following is a party:
(a)
enterprises that
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by, or are under common control with,
our Company;
(b)
associates;
(c)
individuals owning,
directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of our Company that gives them significant influence over our Company,
and close members of any such individual’s family;
(d)
key management personnel,
that is, those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of our
Company, including directors and senior management of companies and close members of such individuals’ families; and
(e)
enterprises in which
a substantial interest in the voting power is owned, directly or indirectly, by any person described in (c) or (d) or over
which such a person is able to exercise significant influence.
Review,
Approval, and Ratification of Related Party Transactions
Given
our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval, or
ratification of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer(s), Director(s), and significant stockholders.
We intend to establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional
Directors, so that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval, or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an
appropriate committee thereof. On a moving forward basis, our Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.
On
January 10, 2024, the Company issued 100,000 common shares at $0.99 per share to William R. Downs in connection with his appointment
as the Company’s new Chief Financial officer. The issuance of 100,000 shares was recognized at the share price on the date
of the employment agreement.
On
January 26, 2024, Mr. Guzy and Mr. Wellman, being the holders of all of the Company’s Series A Stock converted all 105,000
shares issued and outstanding into common shares at a conversion rate of one to ten. The conversion occurred at the rate specified
in the initial issuance agreement and therefore no gain or loss was recognized on the conversion. In connection with the exercise
of the conversion option, the Company issued 575,000 and 475,000 common shares to Jeffrey J. Guzy and Wm. Barrett Wellman, respectively.
On
August 20, 2024, Mr. Guzy purchased 475,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Wellman in a negotiated transaction. The transfer
had no financial impact on the Company during the year ended December 31, 2024.
