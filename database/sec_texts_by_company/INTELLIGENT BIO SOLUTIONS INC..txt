ITEM
1. BUSINESS.
Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. and its wholly
owned Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc., were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company’s
Australian subsidiary, Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd, was formed on August 4, 2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia
and was renamed to Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd on January 6, 2023. On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting
Limited (“IFP”), a company registered in England and Wales. The Company’s headquarters are in New York, New York.
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing and
screening solutions. The Company operates globally with the objective of providing innovative and accessible solutions that improve the
quality of life.
Our
Testing Platforms
Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform:
The Company’s current active product is the Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform, which consists of the proprietary portable
platform that analyzes fingerprint sweat using a one-time cartridge and portable handheld reader. The flagship product from this
platform, which is commercially available in certain countries outside of the United States, is the Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug
Screening System (the “IFP System” or “IFP Products”), a two-part system that consists of non-invasive,
fingerprint sweat-based diagnostic testing products designed to detect drugs of abuse including opiates, cocaine, methamphetamines,
benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone, and buprenorphine. The IFP System comprises a small, tamper-evident drug screening cartridge
onto which ten fingerprint sweat samples are collected in under a minute before the portable analysis unit provides an on-screen
result in under ten minutes. Samples collected with a confirmatory kit can also be sent to a third-party laboratory service provider
for confirmation testing. Customers include safety-critical industries such as construction, transportation and logistics, mining,
manufacturing, engineering, drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, and judicial organizations.
We plan to bring the IFP System to new markets and grow within existing markets concentrating on:
●
increasing market share across the United Kingdom and mainland
Europe;
●
commencing sales and distribution throughout Australia, New
Zealand and other countries in the Asia Pacific Region (“APAC Region”), and establishing the infrastructure and satisfying
the regulatory requirements needed to do so;
●
continue to work on 510(k) pre-market notification submitted
on December 2024 for expansion into United States markets that require FDA clearance, followed by the planned initial launch of our opiate
test system for codeine and then for additional drugs following such additional FDA clearance as may be required;
●
initiating research aimed at broadening the capabilities of
the IFP System to test for additional drugs and indications, facilitating the expansion of the platform into point-of-care medical testing;
●
expanding the IFP System into new customer segments, including
major sporting organizations, law enforcement, and commercial airlines; and
●
developing a strategic network of distributors with established
customer bases throughout the APAC Region, Europe and North America to distribute the IFP Products.
Biosensor Platform: Under the terms
of an Amended and Restated License Agreement dated September 12, 2019 (the “BPT License Agreement”), between the Company
and Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or “Licensor”), the Company held an exclusive license
in the Asia Pacific Region (“APAC Region”) to the Licensor’s proprietary rights to the biosensor technology (the
“Biosensor IP”) used in the biosensor platform we refer to as the Biosensor Platform Technology (“BPT”), or
simply the “Biosensor Platform”. This platform consists of a small, printable modified organic thin-film transistor
strip designed to detect multiple biological analytes by substituting the top enzyme layer of the biosensor to suit each analyte. We
refer to products that use the BPT as the “Licensed Products”. This platform technology has the potential to develop a
range of Point of Care Tests. We understand that following the appointment of a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the Biosensor
IP we licensed from LSBD has reverted back to the University of Newcastle. Following our ongoing discussions with the University, it
is the Company’s understanding that the University of Newcastle cannot finalize licensing of the Biosensor IP until the
liquidation of LSBD is complete. As the timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation is unknown, the Company does not
expect any updates or finalization of any license terms until this occurs. As a result, further development of the BPT has been
postponed until we are able to finalize licensing arrangements related to the BPT. For more information regarding our licensing
agreements with LSBD, see “Item 1. Business - Technology License Agreements.”
Reportable
Segments
The businesses discussed in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K reflect the reportable segments that existed through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. Effective June 30, 2025, we revised
our reportable segments to a region-focused structure, aligning with changes in our business and organizational structure. This transition
was driven by several key developments, including the end of a project for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Australia during
the fourth fiscal quarter and decision by management to not pursue the BPT any further on until the liquidation of the LSBD is complete
following the reversion of intellectual property rights (BPT related) to the University of Newcastle after the liquidation of the former
licensor.
These events prompted a reassessment of the Company’s operating model and strategic priorities, resulting in the adoption
of a region-based segment reporting structure that better aligns with the geographic focus of the business and how management evaluates
performance and allocates resources.
Our
new reportable segments are: (i) United Kingdom; (ii) Asia Pacific (APAC); (iii) Americas; and (iv) Rest of World. These new reportable
segments reflect how the Company is currently managed and correspond to the manner in which financial information is reviewed by our
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for resource allocation and performance assessment.
Historical
segment reporting, which was based on products—(i) Commercially Available Intelligent Fingerprinting Products (“IFPG”
or “IFPG segment”), and (ii) Development-Stage Biosensor Platform Technology (“BPT segment”)—has been recast
in this filing to reflect the new structure.
Note 4, “Segment Reporting”, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report provides information on revenue, government support income,
net income (loss), long-lived assets, and inventory by our revised segments.

Our Products
Intelligent
Fingerprinting Drug Screening System
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Intelligent Fingerprinting
Limited (IFP), is the developer and owner of our proprietary and commercially available portable drug screening system designed to detect
common drugs of abuse through fingerprint sweat. The IFP System consists of a small, tamper-evident drug screening cartridge that collects
ten fingerprint sweat samples, which are then analyzed in a portable handheld reader for precise on-screen results in minutes. This system
eliminates the need for invasive and unpleasant urine, saliva, or blood collection to test for substance abuse. The ten samples are collected
in under a minute before the portable analysis unit provides an on-screen result in under ten minutes. The IFP System is currently designed
to detect opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone, and buprenorphine. In addition, samples collected
via confirmatory kits can be sent to a third-party laboratory service provider for confirmation testing.
Intelligent
Fingerprinting Drug Screening System Functionality
The IFP System consists of single-use, tamper-evident
Intelligent Fingerprinting Cartridges for sample collection and the portable Intelligent Fingerprinting DSR-Plus portable analysis unit.
The cartridge is inserted into a reader, and within 10 minutes, the results are displayed, with options to print and save anonymized data
for further use. Results can also be downloaded to a computer and be used for, among other things, and to the extent legally permissible,
integration with employee medical records or for general statistical analysis. Results can also be downloaded to a computer and be used

resulting in a broader range of diagnostic tools for healthcare providers.
To
facilitate the expansion of point-of-care testing into additional areas of interest, such as tumor markers, hormones, and allergies,
the core team will collaborate with external research specialists. This joint exploration aims to unlock the untapped potential applications
of the existing lateral flow assay technology on which the Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform has been developed. By expanding the capabilities
of this platform, the Company will be better equipped to address diverse diagnostic needs and contribute to improved patient outcomes.
Regulatory
Matters
The
Company operates in a highly regulated industry. Its current and future business has been and will continue to be subject to a variety
of laws globally regarding quality, safety, efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical evaluations, marketing authorization,
commercial sales, and distribution of our products.
Internationally,
various regulatory bodies monitor and supervise the administration of pharmaceutical products and medical devices and equipment. Their
primary responsibilities include evaluating, registering and approving new drugs, generic drugs and imported drugs; approving and issuing
permits for the manufacture, export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical appliances; approving the establishment of enterprises
for pharmaceutical manufacture and distribution; formulating administrative rules and policies concerning the supervision and administration
of food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals; and handling significant accidents involving these products.
The
Company will be subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements, which may include labelling regulations and medical device
reporting regulations, and which may require it to report to different regulatory agencies if its device causes or contributes to a death
or serious injury or malfunctions in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The Company may be subject
to further regulations regarding import and export restrictions, tariff regulations, and duties and tax requirements. These regulatory
requirements may change in the future.
The
Company’s research, development and manufacturing operations, including its product assembly line in Cambridge, UK, involve the
use of hazardous substances, and consequently, it is subject to a variety of foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the
storage, use, handling, generation, manufacture, treatment, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company’s products
may also contain hazardous substances and they are subject to laws and regulations relating to labelling and to their sale, collection,
recycling, treatment, storage, and disposal. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be expensive and noncompliance could result
in substantial fines and penalties. Environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous
substances into the environment and for personal injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances, and they can give rise to
substantial remediation costs and to third-party claims, including for property damage and personal injury. Liability under environmental
laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence, and they tend to become more stringent over
time, imposing greater compliance costs and increased risks and penalties associated with violations.
Our
R&D, manufacturing facilities and operations for drug screening products must also adhere to stringent quality criteria, complying
with ISO 13485 for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices and Medical Devices, as well as ISO 9001. We have quality and regulatory oversight of
our sub-contracted reference laboratories, where our methodology is accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), ensuring
that the laboratory operates according to the ISO 17025 standard.
Australia: While we
are already permitted to sell the IFP System as a drug screening device in Australia, we have obtained accreditation from NATA (National
Association of Testing Authorities, Australia).
We
have partnered with Racing Analytical Services Limited (RASL), one of Australia’s largest independent drug testing laboratories,
to provide confirmation tests for our drug screening solutions.
5
United States of America:
We are currently navigating our regulatory pathway in the United States as we seek approval to sell the IFP System in the United States.
We completed a 510(k) submission in December 2024, and remain focused on securing FDA 510(k) clearance for the IFP System’s opiate
test system for codeine in the U.S., which will enable broader use beyond current Forensic Use Only settings. Additionally, we must identify
potential laboratory partners for further certifications and studies that may be necessary. In fiscal 2025, the Company advanced its regulatory
strategy through increased engagement with regulatory consultants, refined clinical study design, and the generation of new scientific
and clinical data to support its submission. We anticipate that obtaining FDA clearance will benefit entry into other regions of the world.
Other
Regions: Distributors in other countries and jurisdictions will be responsible for obtaining all necessary approvals within their
respective territories.

There
are four primary categories of recreational drugs: analgesics, depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Analgesics include narcotics
like heroin, morphine, fentanyl, and codeine. Depressants include alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and nicotine. Stimulants include
cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy (MDMA). Hallucinogens include LSD, psilocybin and ketamine.
According
to the 2024 World Drug Report published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the emergence of new synthetic opioids and a
record supply and demand of other drugs has compounded the impacts of the world drug problem, leading to a rise in drug use disorders
and environmental harms. Approximately 292 million people used drugs worldwide in 2022, a 20% increase over the previous decade. Cannabis
remains the world’s most used drug, with 228 million users. Opioid use remains a major concern, with 60 million users, followed
by amphetamines (30 million users), cocaine (23.5 million users), and ecstasy (20 million users). Nitazenes, a group of synthetic opioids
which can be even more potent than fentanyl, have recently emerged in several high-income countries, resulting in an increase in overdose
deaths. Though an estimated 64 million people worldwide suffer from drug use disorders, only one in 11 is in treatment4.
According to the 2022 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), approximately 54.6 million people aged 12 or older in the U.S. needed substance use treatment in
2022. Of those, only 13.1 million received any form of treatment5. To address this treatment gap, the White House’s 2024
National Drug Control Strategy Performance Review highlights more than $82 billion in federal investments in treatment and harm reduction
services6.

Competition
IFP
has developed a Point of Care (POC) drug screening test system and a drug laboratory-based confirmation testing service. Both of these
involve the collection of fingerprint sweat samples for analysis. For many years, competitor POC and confirmation tests relied on collecting
either urine or oral fluid (saliva) samples. There are several competitive advantages of analyzing fingerprint sweat over urine and oral
fluid drug testing:
1.
Non-Invasive
sample collection: Fingerprint sweat can be collected within seconds from any location without needing trained specialists, gender-specific
collectors or prepared collection areas. The sweat from the fingerprints is collected simply by pressing each finger onto a disposable
sample collection cartridge for five seconds. In contrast, the collection of urine and oral fluid samples can take several hours
and requires trained collectors. Collection areas must be specially prepared, and sample collection should be observed directly to
avoid cheating tests. This is highly invasive, particularly in the case of urine.
2.
Hygienic
and non-biohazardous: Fingerprint sweat samples are non-biohazardous, so the screening and collection kit material can be disposed
of in routine waste or recycled. Kits used to collect urine and saliva are a potential biohazard and must be treated as such –
either incinerated or into landfill.
3.
Accurate
Results: The results of conventional urine and oral fluid POC drug screening tests require reading the test results by interpreting
the presence or absence of colored test lines using the naked eye. Often these test lines are weak and difficult to see, leading
to inaccuracy in reading the test result. In contrast, the results of the IFP screening test are provided automatically by the DSR-Plus
reader unit, providing an unambiguous test result that does not require any user interpretation, increasing the accuracy of the test.
The
combination of these benefits shows that fingerprint drug testing provides a more cost-effective, less invasive and more dignified method
when compared to urine and oral fluid-based tests.
The table below compares the IFP System to other
drug testing systems:
10
The
IFP System eliminates the need for highly trained technicians or personal protective equipment, providing a non-invasive and objective
testing experience. Its unique 16-hour detection window makes it ideal for assessing an individual’s fitness for work at the time
of testing. Based on research commissioned by the Company, the system has the ability to achieve sensitivity and accuracy levels as demonstrated
by the performance characteristics in the table below.
We
believe that the lateral flow assay technology used in IFP Products has the potential to also deliver significant benefits in other areas
of medical diagnostics. For example, the potential exists use the technology to detect biomarkers of health and disease and provide non-invasive
monitoring of therapeutic drug levels via fingerprint analysis. IFP is also researching a pipeline of development projects with the vision
that fingerprint-based diagnostic tests could provide rapid health/disease triage and wellness tests, meeting the requirements of a post-COVID
medical diagnostics world. The Company seeks to broaden development pathways into other areas of medical diagnostics utilizing existing
technology and techniques to exploit a competitive advantage against traditional testing methodologies. Some examples of potential target
assays are: fentanyl and other opiate pain medications, epilepsy management medications, anti-psychotic medications, cortisol (stress
marker for wellbeing determination), protein targets, diabetes markers (c-peptide, fructosamine, insulin and proinsulin), infectious
diseases (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), Lyme disease, dengue, measles and German measles) and food contamination
/ infection from animals (brucella, salmonella, proteus).
The
medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other
activities of industry participants. We face potential competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have
longer, more established operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other
resources. Our overall competitive position depends upon several factors, including product performance and reliability, connectivity,
manufacturing cost, and customer support.

Technology
License Agreements
We had entered into following
technology license agreements with LSBD, which is now in liquidation:
1) The
Amended and Restated License Agreement dated September 12, 2019, which amends and restates all previous license agreements (the “BPT
License Agreement”) is limited to the APAC Region.
2) The
technology license agreement dated June 23, 2020 (the “COV2 License Agreement”), for COV2 diagnostic test globally.
In
addition to the above, we have a 50% equity interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc., which has a separate technology license agreement
with the Licensor covering glucose/diabetes management field in the North America Territory.
BPT
License Agreement
Under
the terms of the BPT License Agreement we held an exclusive license in the APAC Region to the LSBD’s proprietary rights to the
biosensor technology used in the biosensor platform we refer to as the Biosensor Platform Technology (BPT), or simply the “Biosensor
Platform.” This platform consists of a small, printable modified organic thin-film transistor strip designed to detect multiple
biological analytes by substituting the top enzyme layer of the biosensor to suit each analyte. This platform technology has the potential
to develop a range of Point of Care Tests.
We understand that following the appointment of
a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the intellectual property (IP) rights we licensed from LSBD have reverted back to the University
of Newcastle. Following our ongoing discussions with the University of Newcastle, it is the Company’s understanding that the University
of Newcastle cannot finalize licensing of the proprietary rights related to the BPT until the liquidation of LSBD is complete. As the
timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation is unknown, the Company does not expect any updates or finalization of any license
terms until this occurs.
12
COV2
License Agreement
On
June 23, 2020, we entered into a COV2 License Agreement, with LSBD. The COV2 License Agreement sets forth our contractual rights and
responsibilities relating to the COV2 Products. The “COV2 Products” include: (i) a biosensor strip for antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2; (ii) a proprietary smartphone application for the purpose reading, storing, analyzing and providing patient support programs
for any one or more of the indicators for the purpose of measuring the amount or concentration of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) specific
to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and/or (iii) a dedicated sensor strip reading device for any one or
more of the indicators for the purpose of measuring the amount or concentration of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) specific to severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Under the COV2 License Agreement, the Licensor granted to us an exclusive worldwide
license to Licensor’s proprietary rights to the biosensor technology used in the COV2 Products.
We understand that following the appointment of
a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the intellectual property (IP) rights we licensed from LSBD have reverted back to the University
of Newcastle. Following our ongoing discussions with the University of Newcastle, it is the Company’s understanding that the University
of Newcastle cannot finalize licensing of the proprietary rights related to COV2 Products until the liquidation of LSBD is complete. As
the timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation is unknown, the Company does not expect any updates or finalization of any
license terms until this occurs.
Intellectual
Property
Our
biosensor business is dependent on the proprietary biosensor technology we licensed from LSBD. The original patent application, which
claims a priority date of March 2012, has been granted in the United States (9,766,199) and China (ZL201380022888.2). A second patent
application for a different iteration of the device design has been filed with a priority date of June 2016 and is granted in the United
States (10,978,653) and Australia (2016412541). A third patent application for a further iteration of the device has been filed with
a priority date of May 15, 2018. Further patents may yet be issued based on all three applications.
The
Chinese and the United States patents belong to the same patent family and relate to the same invention. The United States and Australian
patents originating with the second application are similarly of the same patent family and relate to the same invention. The exact wording
of the patent claims varies between countries.
The
patents protect the following technological claims of the BPT: the architecture of a biofunctional organic thin film transistor device
comprising a gate electrode, a dielectric layer, a partially organic semiconducting layer, a source electrode, a drain electrode, a substrate
and an enzyme; the method for producing the organic thin film transistor device; and methods of using the device to detect glucose levels.
A similar device with no dielectric layer. Further devices including a porous wicking layer to facilitate onset of device function.
We understand that following the appointment of
a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the intellectual property (IP) rights we licensed from LSBD have reverted back to the University
of Newcastle. Following our ongoing discussions with the University of Newcastle, it is the Company’s understanding that the University
of Newcastle cannot finalize licensing of the proprietary rights related to the BPT until the liquidation of LSBD is complete. As the
timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation is unknown, the Company does not expect any updates or finalization of any license
terms until this occurs.
We
intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property rights for any technologies owned through patents and copyrights, both in the
United States and internationally. Additionally, we plan to leverage trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation
to develop and maintain its competitive position. We intend to protect its proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including
confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors
and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual
property to it as a condition of employment. All consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign all new and improved intellectual property
that arise during the term of the agreement to the Company. In addition, we may license additional technologies from third parties. Prior
to any further acquisition or licensing of technology from a third party, the Company will evaluate the existing proprietary rights,
its ability to obtain and protect these rights, and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.
The
issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the
patents in the countries where they are obtained. In most countries where the Company files patents, the patent term is 20 years from
the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent
is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term
may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office in granting a patent.

results and financial condition. This summary is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this Item.
●
We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in
the future. If we are unsuccessful in attracting new capital, we may not be able to continue operations or may be forced to sell
assets to do so. Alternatively, capital may not be available to us on favorable terms, or if at all. If available, financing terms
may lead to significant dilution of our stockholders’ equity.
●
Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory
paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
●
We have incurred significant losses since inception and continue to
incur losses, and we may not be able to achieve significant revenues or profitability.

increase our marketing and sales capabilities as we grow, or if we fail to develop broad awareness of our products in a cost-effective
manner, we may not be able to generate revenue growth.
●
Our ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining
or increasing our gross margins on product sales which we may not be able to achieve.
●
We expect to rely in part on third-party distributors to effectively
distribute our products, if our distributors fail to effectively market and sell the IFP products in full compliance with applicable
laws, our operating results and business may suffer.
●
If third-party payors do not provide coverage and reimbursement for
the use of the IFP products, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.
●
Non-United States governments often impose strict price controls, which
may adversely affect our future profitability.
●
The IFP System, including its software and systems, may contain undetected
errors, which could limit our ability to provide our products and services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings.
●
If we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial,
scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to implement our business model successfully.
●
If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory
quality system regulations or any applicable equivalent regulations, our proposed operations could be interrupted, and our operating
results may be negatively impacted.
●
We may be subject to healthcare laws and regulations which, if violated,
could subject us to substantial penalties.
●
Product liability suits, whether or not meritorious, could be brought
against us due to an alleged defective product or for the misuse of the IFP System.

If we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality
of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm
our reputation or our business.
●
Changes
to U.S. tax laws under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and potential changes to tariff policies could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
●
The regulatory clearance/approval process which we may be required
to navigate may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining clearance for any product launch by
the Company of the IFP products in certain jurisdiction or our any future product.
●
Clinical data obtained subsequent to the implementation of the clinical
evidence module may not meet the required objectives, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory clearance or approval.
●
We may be unable to complete required clinical evaluations, or we may
experience significant delays in completing such clinical evaluations, which could prevent or significantly delay our targeted product
launch timeframe and impair our business plan.
●
We are subject to the risk of reliance on third parties to conduct
our clinical evaluation work, their inability to comply with good clinical practice and relevant regulation could adversely affect
the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business.
●
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect
our intellectual property rights.
●
We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights,
including those licensed to us, which could impair our competitive position.
●
We have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be
able to protect those intellectual property rights, which means that we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing
our inventions or from selling or importing products made using those inventions.
●
We may be subject to claims challenging the invention of the intellectual
property that we use.
●
Our products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation
and oversight both in the United States and abroad. If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals current IFP
products, or if approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, it will negatively affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
●
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive,
and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.
●
If we or our suppliers fail to comply with The United Kingdom Accreditation
Services (UKAS), FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and CE (European Conformity) Markings and other relevant regulations
regulation, our manufacturing or distribution operations could be delayed or shut down and our revenue could suffer.
●
The
Company may not be able to repay the liability to the Australian Government on time.
●
If we are unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements
of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to trade in our securities.
●
We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation
of the material weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in
the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future,
we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations,
which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
●
We are obligated to develop and maintain a system of effective internal
control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner,
or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may harm investor confidence in our company and, as a result,
the value of our common stock.
●
We are an emerging growth company and currently have limited accounting
personnel and other supervisory resources. This can result in a lack of necessary resources to adequately execute our accounting
processes and address our internal controls over financial reporting requirements.
●
Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders,
restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or products.
15
Risks
Related to Our Business
We will need to raise additional capital
to fund our operations in the future. If we are unsuccessful in attracting new capital, we may not be able to continue operations or may
be forced to sell assets to do so. Alternatively, capital may not be available to us on favorable terms, or if at all. If available, financing
terms may lead to significant dilution of our stockholders’ equity.
We are not profitable and
have had negative cash flow from operations since our inception. To fund our operations and to develop and commercialize our products
(including the BPT and planned applications of IFP System), we have relied primarily on equity and some debt financing and government
support income. The Company believes there is material risk that its cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, of $1,019,909 may
be insufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of its
consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2025. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.
Accordingly, the Company will be required to raise additional funds during the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurance that
when the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to the Company, or if at
all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay
or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations. In addition, the Company may be unable to realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
To obtain the additional capital necessary to fund our operations, we expect to finance our cash needs through public
or private equity offerings, debt financing and/or other capital sources. Even if capital is available, it might be available only on
unfavorable terms. Any additional equity or convertible debt financing into which we enter could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose covenants upon us that restrict our operations, including limitations on our
ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger,
consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable
to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need
to relinquish rights to our technologies or our products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If access to sufficient
capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail
one or more product development or commercialization programs, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities, or significantly
reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all of our assets.
Any of these factors could harm our operating results.
Our
independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern
in its report on our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
The report from our independent
registered public accounting firm for the year ended June 30, 2025, includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our losses from operations
and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for
a period of one year after the date the audited financial statements were issued. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as
a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value
at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their
investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially
reasonable terms or if at all. There can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved in the time frame anticipated
by us, or that our cash resources will fund our operating plan for the period anticipated by the Company or that additional funding will
be available on terms acceptable to us, or if at all.
We
are subject to the risks associated with new businesses generally.
We were formed in December
2016 as a new business with a plan to commercialize our licensed technology related to the Biosensor Platform. Our limited operating history
may not be adequate to enable you to fully assess our ability to develop and market the products currently in our pipeline, including
those related to our Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform. Our efforts to date have related to the organization and formation of our company,
strategic planning, product research and development and preparation for commencing regulatory trials. We acquired IFP in October 2022,
which generates minimal revenue. Prior to the acquisition of IFP, the Company’s operations generated no revenue other than income
classified as governmental support income received in connection with grants from the Australian Government. As at the date of this filing,
the revenue generated from the sales of IFP products is not enough to cover our operational costs. Therefore, we are, and expect for the
foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new business focused on the development and sale of
new medical devices and related software applications. As a result, we may be unable to further develop, obtain regulatory approval for,
manufacture, market, sell and derive revenues from the other products in our pipeline, and our inability to do so would materially and
adversely impact our business. In addition, we still must optimize many functions necessary to operate a business, including expanding
our managerial, personnel and administrative structure, continuing product research and development, and assessing and commencing our
marketing activities.
16
Accordingly,
you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that
have not yet commercialized their products or services, particularly those in the medical device and digital health fields. In particular,
potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:
●
implement or execute our current business plan, or that our
business plan is sound;
●maintain our management
team and Board of Directors;
●determine that
the technologies that have been developed are commercially viable;
●attract, enter
into or maintain contracts with, and retain customers; and
●raise any necessary
additional funds in the capital markets or otherwise to effectuate our business plan.
In
the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected.
We
have incurred significant losses since inception and continue to incur losses, and we may not be able to achieve significant revenues
or profitability.
Since our inception, we have
engaged primarily in development activities. We have financed our operations primarily though proceeds from public offerings and private
placements of equity securities, existing trade and shareholder financing arrangements, and the incurrence of debt and have incurred losses
since inception, including a net loss of $10,156,759 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and a net loss of $10,568,733 for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2025. We do not know whether or when we will become profitable.
Our
ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development process
of our products, including regulatory approvals, and achieve substantial acceptance in the marketplace for our existing IFP products.
We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals.
We
rely on third parties to perform certain confirmatory tests for our IFP System.
We rely on third-party service
providers to analyze samples collected from our confirmatory kit of the IFP System. We contract with third-party laboratory service provider
to perform confirmation testing on the samples collected. This service is critical and there are relatively few alternatives. These third-party
service providers may be unwilling or unable to provide the necessary services reliably and at the levels we anticipate or that are required
by the market. While these third-party service providers have generally met our demand for their services on a timely basis in the past,
we cannot guarantee that they will in the future be able to meet our demand for their services or our service providers may decide in
the future to discontinue or reduce the level of business they conduct with us. If we are required to change service providers for any
reason, including due to any change in or termination of our relationships with these third parties, we may lose sales, experience delays,
incur increased costs or otherwise experience impairment to our customer relationships. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish
alternative relationships on similar terms, without delay or if at all.
17
We
depend on a limited number of single-source suppliers to manufacture certain components of IFP System, which makes us vulnerable to supply
shortages and price fluctuations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
rely on single-source suppliers for certain components of our IFP System and materials for our other current products. These components
and materials are critical and there are no or relatively few alternative sources of supply. These single-source suppliers may be unwilling
or unable to supply the necessary materials and components or manufacture and assemble our products reliably and at the levels we anticipate
or that are required by the market. While our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products and services on a timely basis
in the past, we cannot guarantee that they will in the future be able to meet our demand for their products or our suppliers may decide
in the future to discontinue or reduce the level of business they conduct with us. If we are required to change suppliers due to any
change in or termination of our relationships with these third parties, or if our suppliers are unable to obtain the materials, they
need to produce our products at consistent prices or at all, we may lose sales, experience manufacturing or other delays, incur increased
costs or otherwise experience impairment to our customer relationships. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish alternative
relationships on similar terms, without delay or at all.
Our
results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Except for limited Forensic
Use Only sales, all of our sales are outside of the United States, and a majority of those are denominated in foreign currencies, which
exposes us to foreign currency risks, including changes in currency exchange rates. We do not currently engage in any hedging transactions.
If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful, and our business
could be harmed.
If
we fail to retain marketing and sales personnel, or if we fail to increase our marketing and sales capabilities as we grow, or if we
fail to develop broad awareness of our products in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to generate revenue growth.
We
have limited experience marketing and selling our products. We currently primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products
in targeted geographic regions and distributors in certain regions including the United Kingdom, and any failure to maintain and grow
our direct sales force will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The members of our direct
sales force are highly trained and possess substantial technical expertise, which we believe is critical in increasing adoption of our
products. The members of our U.K. sales force are at-will employees. The loss of these personnel to competitors, or otherwise, will negatively
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace
them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, or if we are unable to successfully install such technical
expertise in replacement personnel, it may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In
order to generate future growth, we plan to continue to expand and leverage our sales and marketing infrastructure to increase the number
of customers. Identifying and recruiting qualified sales and marketing personnel and training them on our product, on applicable laws
and regulations and on our internal policies and procedures requires significant time, expense and attention. It often takes several
months or more before a sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our sales force may subject us to higher fixed costs than
those of companies with competing techniques or products that utilize independent third parties, which could place us at a competitive
disadvantage. It will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if our efforts to expand and train
our sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, and our higher fixed costs may slow our ability to reduce costs
in the face of a sudden decline in demand for our products. Any failure to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, to achieve
desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or timely reduce fixed costs, could negatively affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Our
ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will depend to a significant extent on our
ability to expand our marketing efforts. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our marketing programs, as we plan to further plan
to expand our geographical reach especially in the APAC Region and the North America region.
It will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if our marketing efforts and expenditures do not
generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, we believe that developing and maintaining broad awareness of our products
in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving broad acceptance of our products and expanding domestically and internationally.
18
Our
results of operations will be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our
inventory.
To
ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and manufacture our products based on our estimates of future demand
for our solution. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our solution could be negatively affected by many factors, including
our failure to accurately manage our expansion strategy, product introductions by competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand
for our products or products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, unanticipated
changes in general market conditions or regulatory matters and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic
conditions.
Inventory
levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs, which would cause our gross margin to be adversely
affected and could impair the strength of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, our internal manufacturing
team may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships.
In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand, additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity
may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or may not be able to allocate sufficient
capacity in order to meet our increased requirements, which will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in order to protect ourselves from supply interruptions. As a result, we are subject
to the risk that a portion of our inventory will become obsolete or expire, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings
and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.
If
our facilities become damaged or inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop and supply our products which could negatively
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations until we are able to secure a new facility and rebuild our inventory.
We
do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our manufacturing, research and development and back office activity
for our IFP products in a single location at our Cambridge facility in the United Kingdom. We store our finished goods inventory at the
same facility. Our facilities, equipment and inventory would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or
replace. The facilities could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes,
flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and commercialization
activities for some period of time for the IFP System. The inability to perform those activities, combined with the time it may take
to rebuild our manufacturing capabilities, inventory of finished product, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation.
Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to
cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Our
ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales which we may not be
able to achieve.
A
number of factors may adversely impact our gross margins on product sales and services, including:
●
lower than expected manufacturing yields of high-cost components
leading to increased manufacturing costs;
●
shortages of electric components resulting in higher prices
or an inability to supply key parts;
●
low production volume which will result in high levels of overhead
cost per unit of production;
●
the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;
●
increased material or labor costs;
●
increased service or warranty costs or the failure to reduce
service or warranty costs;
●
increased price competition;
●
variation in the margins across products in a particular period;
and
●
how well we execute on our strategic and operating plans.
19
If
we are unable to maintain or increase our gross margins on product sales, our results of operations could be adversely impacted, we may
not achieve profitability and our stock price could decline.
We
cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any sales of any of our products, making the timing of any associated revenues uncertain
and difficult to forecast.
We
may be faced with lengthy and unpredictable customer evaluation and approval processes associated with our products. Consequently, we
may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense in developing customer adoption of our products,
which may not result in revenue generation for those products. We must also obtain regulatory clearance or approvals our products in
the respective jurisdiction, which is subject to risk and potential delays, and may actually occur. The same risks apply to other tests
we may develop based on the IFP System. As such, we cannot accurately predict the volume, if any, or timing of any future sales.
.
We
expect to rely in part on third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products, if our distributors fail to effectively market
and sell the IFP products in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer.
We
will depend in part on qualified distributors for the marketing and selling of our products. We will depend on these distributors’
efforts to market our products, yet we will be unable to control their efforts completely. These distributors typically would sell a
variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling our products. In addition, we are unable
to ensure that our distributors will comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to
effectively market and sell our products in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer. Recruiting
and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offering will require significant time
and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we will be required to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support
our distributors. Further, if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates, we may be unable to replace that distributor
without disruption to our business. If we fail to develop or maintain positive relationships with our distributors, including in new
markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize these distributors effectively, or fail to provide distributors with competitive products
on attractive terms, or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, we may not achieve or may have a reduction in
revenue and our operating results, reputation and business would be harmed.
Failure
in our conventional, online and digital marketing efforts could impact our ability to generate sales.
We
intend to engage in conventional marketing strategies and also may utilize online and digital marketing in order to create awareness
of the IFP products. Our management believes that using a wide variety of marketing strategies, including online advertisement and a
variety of other pay-for-performance methods may be effective for marketing and generating sales of the IFP products, as opposed to relying
exclusively on traditional, expensive retail channels. In any event, there is a risk that any or all of our marketing strategies could
fail. We cannot predict whether the use of traditional and/or non-traditional retail sales tools, in combination with reliance on healthcare
providers to educate our customers about the IFP products, will be successful in effectively marketing the IFP products. The failure
of our marketing efforts could negatively impact our ability to generate sales.
As
we intend to conduct business internationally, we are susceptible to risks associated with international relationships, which could adversely
impact our results of operations and financial condition.
We
expect to market, promote and sell our products globally. The international nature of our business requires significant management attention,
which could negatively affect our business if it diverts their attention from their other responsibilities. In addition, doing business
with foreign customers subjects us to additional risks that companies do not generally face if they operate exclusively within a single
jurisdiction. These risks and uncertainties include:
●
different regulatory requirements for medical product approvals
in foreign countries;
20
●
different standards of care in various countries that could
complicate the evaluation of our product candidates;
●
different medical product import and export rules;
●
different labor laws;
●
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain
countries;
●
unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory
requirements;
●
different reimbursement systems and different competitive medical
products;
●
localization of products and services, including translation
of foreign languages;
●
delivery, logistics and storage costs;
●
longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties
in collecting accounts receivable;
●
difficulties providing customer services;
●
economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability
in particular foreign economies and markets;
●
compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws
for employees living or traveling abroad;
●
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the “FCPA,”
and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;
●
foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
●
foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased
operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;
●
restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;
●
workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more
common than in the United States;
●
potential liability resulting from development work conducted
by third-party foreign distributors; and
●
business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions,
including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, management, communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences
and geographic dispersion.
The
occurrence of any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business. In the event that we are unable to manage the complications
associated with international operations, our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects could be materially and
adversely affected.
If
third-party payors do not provide coverage and reimbursement for the use of the IFP products, our business and prospects may be negatively
impacted.
Third-party
payors, whether governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition,
in certain countries, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-party
payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor.
In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products
and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to
provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate
reimbursement will be obtained or maintained if obtained. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country
and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international
markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international
markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. For example, no government
in the areas where we market the IFP System has approved reimbursement of the IFP System. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is
not available for our current or future products, in any country where our license operates, the demand for our products and our revenues
will be adversely affected.
21
Non-United
States governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.
We
intend to seek approval to market and expand the IFP products offerings in the APAC region. If we obtain approval for IFP products in
one or more of the jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our products. In some
countries, pricing may be subject to governmental control under certain circumstances, which may vary country by country. In these countries,
pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of requisite marketing approval. To obtain
reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical evaluation that compares the cost-effectiveness
of our product to other available products. If reimbursement of our products or product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope
or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Price controls may reduce
prices to levels significantly below those that would prevail in less regulated markets or limit the volume of products which may be
sold, either of which may have a material and adverse effect on potential revenues from sales of the IFP products. Moreover, the process
and timing for the implementation of price restrictions is unpredictable, which may cause potential revenues from the sales of the IFP
products to fluctuate from period to period.
The
IFP System, including its software and systems, may contain undetected errors, which could limit our ability to provide our products
and services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings.
The
IFP System may contain undetected errors, defects or bugs. As a result, our customers or end users may discover errors or defects in
our products, software or systems, or our products, software or systems may not operate as expected. We may discover significant errors
or defects in the future that we may not be able to fix. Our inability to fix any of those errors could limit our ability to provide
our products and services, impair the reputation of our brand and diminish the attractiveness of our product and service offerings to
our customers. In addition, we may utilize third-party technology or components in our products, and we rely on those third parties to
provide support services to us. The existence of errors, defects or bugs in third-party technology or components, or the failure of those
third parties to provide necessary support services to us, could materially adversely impact our business.
We
will rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business, and
a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.
We
will depend on sophisticated software and other information technology systems to operate our business, including to process, transmit
and store sensitive data, and our products and services will include information technology systems that collect data regarding patients.
We could experience attempted or actual interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems, as well as
data breaches, such as cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference with the integrity of our products and data or other
significant disruptions. Furthermore, we may rely on third-party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information
technology systems. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference
or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption
or compromise the information security of our own systems. Our international operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations,
including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. Furthermore, there has been a developing trend
of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber-attacks.
Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies
and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition,
cash flows, reputation or competitive position. In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant
resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information
processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, changes
in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated
any new products and services. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems
and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing
changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. If our
information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, patients or employees could be exposed to financial
or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality, and we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting
new customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information,
have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties, experience increases
in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data
privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits
or other legal action and damage to our reputation.
22
Our
future performance will depend on the continued engagement of key members of our management team, and the loss of one or more of the
key members of our management team could have a negative impact on our business.
Our
future performance depends to a large extent on the continued services of members of our current management including, in particular,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In the event that we lose the continued services of such key personnel for any
reason, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
If
we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to implement
our business model successfully.
We
believe that our management team must be able to act decisively to apply and adapt our business model in the markets in which we will
compete. In addition, we will rely upon technical and scientific employees or third-party contractors to effectively establish, manage
and grow our business. Consequently, we believe that our future viability will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly
skilled managerial, sales, scientific and technical personnel. In order to do so, we may need to pay higher compensation or fees to our
employees or consultants than we currently expect, and such higher compensation payments would have a negative effect on our operating
results. Competition for experienced, high-quality personnel is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain
such personnel. We may not be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy. Our failure to hire
and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively.
If
we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory quality system regulations or any applicable equivalent regulations,
our proposed operations could be interrupted, and our operating results may be negatively impacted.
We
and any third-party manufacturers and suppliers of ours will be required, to the extent of applicable regulation, to follow the quality
system regulations of each jurisdiction we will seek to penetrate and also will be subject to the regulations of these jurisdictions
regarding the manufacturing processes. If we or any third-party manufacturers or suppliers of ours are found to be in significant non-compliance
or fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to adverse regulatory findings in this regard, regulatory agencies could take
enforcement actions against us and such manufacturers or suppliers, which could impair or prevent our ability to produce our products
in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet customers’ demands. Accordingly, our operating results would suffer.
We
may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally,
any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and
thus could harm our business.
There
are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false
claims and transparency laws. Many international healthcare laws and regulations apply to the medical testing and medical device businesses.
We will be subject to certain regulations regarding commercial practices false claims. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws,
including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals, or entities from knowingly presenting,
or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent.
Private individuals can bring False Claims Act “qui tam” actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly
known as “whistleblowers,” may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity
is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose substantial penalties plus three times the
amount of damages which the government sustains because of the submission of a false claim, and exclude the entity from participation
in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
23
If
our operations or arrangements are found to be in violation of governmental regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties,
damages, fines and the curtailment of our operations. All of these penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business
and our financial results.
Product
liability suits, whether or not meritorious, could be brought against us due to an alleged defective product or for the misuse of the
IFP System. These suits could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, and an increase in our
insurance rates.
If
the IFP System or any future diagnostic test based on the IFP System is defectively designed or manufactured, contains defective components
or is misused, or if someone claims any of the foregoing, whether or not meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly
litigation. Misusing our devices or failing to adhere to the operating guidelines or our devices producing inaccurate meter readings
could cause significant harm to patients, including death. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may
be subject to liability. Product liability claims could divert management’s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend
and result in sizable damage awards against us. While we expect to maintain product liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance
coverage for all future claims. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability
insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and could reduce revenue.
Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves harming our financial condition and adversely
affecting our results of operations.
If
we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal
penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.
There
are several laws around the world protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and
restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. Privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information
by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information
and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.
We may face difficulties in holding such information in compliance with applicable law. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy
rules, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We
could be party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.
We
may be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business. These legal proceedings may involve
claims brought by employees, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative
proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. These legal proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent
employment practices, including wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and
family leave laws; data security or privacy breaches; violation of the federal securities laws or other concerns.
We
could be involved in litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us in future legal matters are unfounded
or we ultimately are not held liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the litigation may subject us to substantial
settlements, fines, penalties or judgments against us and may consume management’s bandwidth and attention, some or all of which
may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless
of whether the allegations are valid, or we ultimately are liable, which could damage our reputation, and adversely impact our sales
and our relationship with our employees, clients, and guests.
Changes to U.S. tax laws under the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act and potential changes to tariff policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”)
was signed into law, introducing significant amendments to U.S. tax laws, with various provisions taking effect on different dates. Key
provisions include changes to bonus depreciation, the treatment of research and development expenditures, interest expense deductibility,
and revisions to international tax regimes. Although certain changes may reduce our tax liabilities, others could increase our effective
tax rate, impact the timing of our deductions, or alter the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In addition, changes
to U.S. trade policy — including the imposition of new tariffs, increases in existing tariffs, or retaliatory measures by other
countries — could increase the costs of our raw materials, components, or finished goods, or reduce demand for our products. Such
measures could also create volatility in global supply chains, disrupt our sourcing strategies, and adversely affect our competitiveness.
The overall effect of the OBBBA and potential changes to tariff policies on our business and financial results will depend on the interpretation
of the legislation, future regulatory or trade policy actions, and potential changes in our operations or tax profile. We are continuing
to evaluate these risks, and there can be no assurance that their implementation will not materially and adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
24
Risks
Related to Product Development and Regulatory Approval or Clearance
The
regulatory clearance/approval process which we may be required to navigate may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent
us from obtaining clearance for any product launch by the Company of the IFP products in certain jurisdiction or our any future product.
The
IFP products may require regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions to market. To date, we have not received regulatory approval in
the United States. The research, design, testing, manufacturing, labelling, selling, marketing and distribution of medical devices are
subject to extensive regulation by country-specific regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. There can
be no assurance that, even after such time and expenditures, we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearance or approvals for
clinical testing or for the manufacturing or marketing of any products. In addition, during the regulatory process, other companies may
develop other technologies with the same intended use as our products. We also will be subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory
requirements, which may include labelling regulations and medical device reporting regulations, which may require us to report to different
regulatory agencies if our devices cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause
or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, these regulatory requirements may change in the future in a way that adversely
affects us. If we fail to comply with present or future regulatory requirements that are applicable to us, we may be subject to enforcement
action by regulatory agencies, which may include, among others, any of the following sanctions:
●
untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent
decrees and civil penalties;
●
customer notification, or orders for repair, replacement or
refunds;
●
voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our current or
future products;
●
imposing operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of
production;
●
refusing our requests for clearance or pre-market approval
of new products, new intended uses or modifications to the IFP products or future products;
●
rescinding clearance or suspending or withdrawing pre-market
approvals that have already been granted; and
●
criminal prosecution.
The
occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Clinical
data obtained subsequent to the implementation of the clinical evidence module may not meet the required objectives, which could delay,
limit or prevent additional regulatory clearance or approval.
There
can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any clinical evaluations necessary to receive regulatory clearance or approvals.
The preliminary results that are indicative of the potential performance of the IFP products, data already obtained, or to be obtained
in future, from clinical studies do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later clinical evaluations.
We
market IFP products as screening devices. The clinical studies undertaken to date may not meet the requirements of certain regulatory
bodies for us to market in those jurisdictions. The failure to adequately demonstrate the analytical performance characteristics of the
device under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of the device, which could prevent or result in delays
to market launch and could materially harm our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to receive approval for any potential
applications of our principal technology, or that we will receive regulatory clearances from targeted regions or countries.
We
may be unable to complete required clinical evaluations, or we may experience significant delays in completing such clinical evaluations,
which could prevent or significantly delay our targeted product launch timeframe and impair our business plan.
The completion of any future
clinical evaluations for the IFP products, or other studies that we may be required to undertake in the future for the IFP or other products
based on the IFP System could be delayed, suspended or terminated for several reasons, including:
●
we may fail to or be unable to conduct the clinical evaluation
in accordance with regulatory requirements;
●
sites participating in the trial may drop out of the trial,
which may require us to engage new sites for an expansion of the number of sites that are permitted to be involved in the trial;
●
patients may not enroll in, remain in or complete, the clinical
evaluation at the rates we expect; and
●
clinical investigators may not perform our clinical evaluation
on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical evaluation protocol and good clinical practices.

If
our clinical evaluations are delayed it will take us longer to ultimately launch the IFP in certain jurisdictions and generate revenues.
Moreover, our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical evaluation or if we need to perform more or
larger clinical evaluations than planned.
We
are subject to the risk of reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical evaluation work, their inability to comply with good clinical
practice and relevant regulation could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business.
We
will depend on independent clinical investigators to conduct our clinical evaluations. Contract research organizations may also assist
us in the collection and analysis of data. These investigators and contract research organizations will not be our employees and we will
not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time that they devote to products that we develop.
If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient resources to our clinical evaluations, or if their performance is substandard,
it will delay the approval or clearance and ultimately the market launch of any products that we develop. Further, regulatory bodies
require that we comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, for conducting, recording and reporting clinical
evaluations to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of
trial subjects are protected. If our independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations fail to comply with good
clinical practice, the results of our clinical evaluations could be called into question and the clinical development of our product
candidates could be delayed. Failure of clinical investigators or contract research organizations to meet their obligations to us or
comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business. Moreover,
we intend to have several clinical evaluations in order to support our marketing efforts and business development purposes. Such clinical
evaluations will be conducted by third parties as well. Failure of such clinical evaluations to meet their primary endpoints could adversely
affect our marketing efforts.
Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property
Our
success will depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights.
In
order to remain competitive, we must develop, maintain and protect the proprietary aspects of our brands, technologies and data. We rely
on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual
property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our brands, technologies and data. These legal measures afford only limited protection,
and competitors or others may gain access to or use our intellectual property and proprietary information. Our success will depend, in
part, on preserving our trade secrets, maintaining the security of our data and know-how and obtaining and maintaining other intellectual
property rights by us. We may not be able to obtain or maintain intellectual property or other proprietary rights necessary to our business
or in a form that provides us with a competitive advantage.
In
addition, our trade secrets, data and know-how could be subject to unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure to unauthorized
parties, despite our efforts to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, clients and other vendors who
have access to such information and could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties. Our intellectual property,
including trademarks, could be challenged, invalidated, infringed, and circumvented by third parties, and our trademarks could also be
diluted, declared generic or found to be infringing on other marks. If any of the foregoing occurs, we could be forced to re-brand our
products, resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands, and suffer
other competitive harm. Third parties may also adopt trademarks similar to ours, which could harm our brand identity and lead to market
confusion. Failure to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights necessary to our business and failure to protect, monitor and
control the use of our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and cause us to incur significant
expenses. The intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements in the United States and other jurisdictions
we depend upon may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement, use, violation or misappropriation of
our trademarks, data, technology and other intellectual property and services, and may not provide an adequate remedy if our intellectual
property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated.
26
We
rely, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, expand, enforce, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio or other
proprietary rights, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection the filing, defense and
enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights. The process of applying for and obtaining a patent is expensive, time
consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce all necessary or desirable patent applications at
a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous, or we may not be able
to protect our proprietary rights at all. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to
obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable,
so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. Our patent applications may not result in issued
patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
The
degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:
●
any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products;
●
any of our pending patent applications will issue as patents;
●
we will be able to successfully commercialize our products on a substantial scale, if approved, before our relevant patents we may have expire;
●
we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications;
●
we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;
●
others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable
●
any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties
●
we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or
●
our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.
Moreover,
even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives.
Issued patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Decisions by courts and governmental patent agencies may introduce
uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by or licensed to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent does not give
us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own
products and practicing our own technology. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or
otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits
alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid,
unenforceable or not infringed; competitors may then be able to market products and use manufacturing and analytical processes that are
substantially similar to ours. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against
competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.
27
Obtaining
and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements
imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.
The
United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance
with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition,
periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent.
While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable
rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting
in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or
lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time
limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent
applications covering our products, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to
our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Patent
terms may not be able to protect our competitive position for an adequate period of time with respect to our current or future technologies.
Patents
have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the standard patent term is typically 20 years after filing. Various extensions may be
available. Even so, the life of a patent and the protection it affords are limited. As a result, our patent portfolio provides us with
limited rights that may not last for a sufficient period of time to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical
to ours. For example, given the large amount of time required for the research, development, testing and regulatory review of medical
devices, patents protecting our products might expire before or shortly after they are commercialized.
Extensions
of patent term may be available, but there is no guarantee that we would succeed in obtaining any particular extension and no guarantee
any such extension would confer patent term for a sufficient period of time to exclude others from commercializing products similar or
identical to ours.
Additionally,
an extension may not be granted or may be limited where there is, for example, a failure to exercise due diligence during the testing
phase or regulatory review process, failure to apply within applicable deadlines, failure to apply before expiration of relevant patents,
or some other failure to satisfy applicable requirements. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to launch their products earlier
by taking advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials along with our clinical and pre-clinical data. This could have
a material adverse effect on our business and ability to achieve profitability.
We
may be subject to claims alleging the violation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could involve in lawsuits to protect
or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.
We
may face significant expense and liability as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights of
others. In the event that another party has intellectual property protection relating to an invention or technologies licensed by us,
we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the regulatory authorities to determine priority of invention,
which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs for us, even if the eventual outcome was favorable to us. We also could be
required to participate in interference proceedings involving intellectual property of another entity. An adverse outcome in an interference
proceeding could require us to cease using the technology, to substantially modify it, which could delay or prevent the launch of our
products in the market or adversely affect our profitability. The cost to us of any intellectual property litigation, even if resolved
in our favor, could be substantial, especially given our early stage of development. A third-party may claim that we are using inventions
claimed by their intellectual property and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as
research, development and the sale of any future products. Such lawsuits are expensive and would consume significant time and other resources.
There is a risk that a court will decide that we are infringing the third-party’s intellectual property and will order us to stop
the activities claimed by the intellectual property. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages
for having infringed their intellectual property. Moreover, there is no guarantee that any prevailing intellectual property owner would
offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in activities claimed by the intellectual property, or that such a license, if
made available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms.
28
As a result of the liquidation of Life Science
Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (LSBD) and the intellectual property rights licensed by the Company from LSBD (the Biosensor IP and intellectual
property related to SARS-CoV-2 testing) reverting back to the University of Newcastle, there is a risk of extended delays in negotiating
the terms of licensing the intellectual property with the University, or that such negotiations may result in less favorable licensing
terms for the Company, or that such negotiations may not be successful, which, in any event, would negatively impact the Company’s
ability to develop and commercialize the BPT, the Licensed Products or the COV2 Products described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We
are party to the BPT License Agreement with LSBD, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company licenses from LSBD certain products
and intellectual property related to the biosensor technology used in the Biosensor Platform, which we refer to as the Biosensor IP.
The Company also holds a 50% interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc., which has exclusive license to use, make, sell and offer to sell
products under the intellectual property rights in connection with the biosensor technology and the glucose/diabetes management field
in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
We understand that following
the appointment of a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the Biosensor IP has reverted back to the University of Newcastle. Following
our ongoing discussions with the University, it is the Company’s understanding that the University of Newcastle cannot finalize
licensing of the Biosensor IP until the liquidation of LSBD is complete. As the timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation
is unknown, the Company does not expect any updates or finalization of license terms until this occurs. As a result, further development
of the BPT has been postponed until we are able to finalize licensing arrangements related to the BPT.
Accordingly,
there is an inherent risk of extended delays in negotiating the terms of licensing the Biosensor IP with the University, or that such
negotiations may result in less favorable licensing terms for the Company, or that such negotiations may not be successful, which, in
any event, would negatively impact the Company’s ability to develop and commercialize the BPT or Licensed Products.
These same risks apply to
the Company’s licensing of intellectual property from LSBD related to the “COV2 Products” described in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, which includes a biosensor strip for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. For more information regarding our licensing agreements
with LSBD and COV2 Products, see “Item 1. Business -Technology License Agreements.”
We
may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including those licensed to us, which could impair our competitive
position.
For
our business to be viable and to compete effectively, the proprietary rights with respect to the technologies and intellectual property
used in our products must be developed and maintained. We rely primarily on patent protection and trade secrets, as well as a combination
of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and intellectual property
rights. There are significant risks associated with our ability to protect our intellectual property, including:
●pending intellectual
property applications may not be approved or may take longer than expected to result in approval in one or more of the countries in which
we operate;
●our intellectual
property rights may not provide meaningful protection;
●other companies
may challenge the validity or extent of our patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights through litigation, oppositions
and other proceedings, which proceedings can be protracted as well as unpredictable;
●other companies
may have independently developed (or may in the future independently develop) similar or alternative technologies, may duplicate our
technologies or may design their technologies around our technologies or technologies we license;
●enforcement of
intellectual property rights is complex, uncertain and expensive, and may be subject to lengthy delays;
●there is an inherent
risk of extended delays in negotiating the terms of licensing the Biosensor IP with the University, or that such negotiations may result
in less favorable licensing terms for the Company, or that such negotiations may not be successful;
●our ability to
enforce our intellectual property protection could be limited by our financial resources; and
●the other risks
described in “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
If
any of our patents or other intellectual property rights fail to protect the technologies we use, it would make it easier for our competitors
to offer similar products. Any inability on our part to adequately protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
29
We
have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect those intellectual property rights, which means that
we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions or from selling or importing products made using those inventions.
Our
intellectual property rights include intellectual property rights related to the IFP products. We have determined that filing, prosecuting
and defending intellectual property rights in all countries globally would be prohibitively expensive, and intellectual property rights
in some countries can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
intellectual property to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from
practicing our inventions or from selling or importing products made using our inventions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions
where we have not obtained intellectual property rights to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products
to territories where we have intellectual property protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. Policing
unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement
of trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to medical device products, which could make it difficult
for us to stop the infringement of our intellectual property or marketing of competing products industry of our proprietary rights generally.
An adverse determination or an insufficient damage award in any such litigation could materially impair our intellectual property rights
and may otherwise harm our business. In addition, some developing countries in the APAC Region have compulsory licensing laws under which
an intellectual property owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies
if our intellectual property is infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third-party, which could materially diminish
the value of that intellectual property.
We
rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce, which could result in third parties using
our intellectual property to compete against us.
Although
we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure
of confidential information to third parties, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the
rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we or the Licensor employ them,
the agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Although we seek to enter into these types of agreements with contractors, consultants,
advisors and research collaborators, to the extent that employees and consultants utilize or independently develop intellectual property
in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the intellectual property rights associated with our technology. If
a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third-party. In addition, enforcement of our rights can be costly
and unpredictable. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we may seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements
with employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:
●
these agreements may be breached;
●
these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the
applicable type of breach;
●
our proprietary know-how will otherwise become known; or
●
our competitors will independently develop similar technology
or proprietary information.
We
may be subject to claims challenging the invention of the intellectual property that we use.
We
may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in intellectual property as an
inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arising from conflicting obligations of consultants or others
who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging
inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property
rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse
effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and
be a distraction to management and other employees. As a result, it is unclear whether and, if so, to what extent employees of ours may
be able to claim compensation with respect to our future revenue. We may receive less revenue from future products if any of our employees
successfully claim compensation for their work in developing our intellectual property, which in turn could impact our future profitability.
Risks
Related to Our Industry
Our
products and operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad. If we fail
to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals current IFP products, or if approvals for future products and indications are delayed
or not issued, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
proprietary IFP System is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and abroad, including the European Union, our largest
market for the IFP System. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
●
Product design, development, manufacture, and release;
●
Laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;
●
Product safety and efficacy;
●
Premarketing clearance or approval;
●
Service operations;
●
Record keeping;
●
Product marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution;
●
Post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals;
●
Post-market approval studies; and
●
Product import and export.
30
If
we fail to remain in compliance with applicable European laws and directives, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE mark to
our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
The
regulatory approval process with FDA in the United States may be an expensive, lengthy and unpredictable process. We may not be able
to obtain any necessary clearances or approval or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which will negatively affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant
limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for product.
The
FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:
●
Our
inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that our products are
safe or effective for their intended uses;
●
The
disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the
interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;
●
Serious
and unexpected adverse effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;
●
The
data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;
●
Our
inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the product outweigh the risks;
●
The
manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and
●
The
potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner
rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval.
Furthermore,
the FDA and state and international authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements
could result in enforcement action by any such agency, which may include any of the following sanctions:
●
Adverse
publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
●
Repair,
replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
●
Operating
restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
●
Denial
of our requests for regulatory clearance or premarket approval of new products or services, new intended uses or modifications to
existing products or services;
●
Withdrawal
of regulatory clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; or
●
Criminal
prosecution.
31
If
any of these events were to occur, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In
addition, the medical device and other medical product industries in the APAC Region, where we plan to expand our product offering in
the near future are generally subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, encompassing the approval, registration,
manufacturing, packaging, licensing and marketing of new products. In addition, the regulatory frameworks in the APAC Region regarding
our industry are subject to change. Any such changes may result in increased compliance costs on our business or cause delays in or prevent
the successful development or launch of our product candidates in the APAC Region. The regulatory authorities in the countries and territories
constituting the APAC Region also may launch investigations of individual companies or on an industry-wide basis. The costs and time
necessary to respond to an investigation can be material. Any failure by us or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws
and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of our business activities
in certain countries and territories in the APAC Region or in the region as a whole.
Compliance
with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us
to significant liability.
Our
research, development and manufacturing operations including product assembly line at Cambridge, UK involve the use of hazardous substances,
and we are subject to a variety foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, handling, generation, manufacture,
treatment, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances. Our products may also contain hazardous substances, and they are subject laws
and regulations relating to labelling requirements and to their sale, collection, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal. Compliance
with these laws and regulations may be expensive and noncompliance could result in substantial fines and penalties. Environmental laws
and regulations also impose liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for personal injuries
resulting from exposure to hazardous substances, and they can give rise to substantial remediation costs and to third-party claims, including
for property damage and personal injury. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard
to fault or negligence, and they tend to become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increased risks and penalties
associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations, or releases of or exposure to hazardous
substances, will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past, including as a result of human error, accidents, equipment
failure or other causes. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations, and liabilities that may be imposed for violating
them, or for remediation obligations or responding to third-party claims, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
If
we or our suppliers fail to comply with The United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS), FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR)
and CE (European Conformity) Markings and other relevant regulations regulation, our manufacturing or distribution operations could be
delayed or shut down and our revenue could suffer.
Our
manufacturing and design processes for certain of our products and those of certain of our third-party suppliers are required to comply
with The United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS), FDA’s QSR and CE markings in the European Union. This covers procedures
and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labelling, packaging, storage and shipping of our IFP
System. We are also subject to ongoing International Organization for Standardization (“ISO 13485”) compliance in all operations,
including design, manufacturing, and service, to maintain our CE Mark. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting
and must make available our facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA,
state authorities, European Union Notified Bodies and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail a regulatory inspection, our
operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse
regulatory inspection could result in, among other things, a shutdown of our manufacturing or product distribution operations, significant
fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our devices, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions,
any of which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our key component suppliers
may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing
delays for our product and cause our revenue to decline.
32
We
can provide no assurance that we will continue to remain in compliance with the UKAS, QSR and European Union Notified Bodies. If the
FDA, UKAS and European Union of Notified Bodies inspect any of our facilities and discover compliance problems, we may have to cease
manufacturing and product distribution until we can take the appropriate remedial steps to correct the audit findings. Taking corrective
action may be expensive, time consuming and a distraction for management and if we experience a delay at our manufacturing facility,
we may be unable to produce our solutions, which will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If
we fail to respond quickly to technological or other developments, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete.
The
drug screening and medical testing market may experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer
requirements, changes in demand, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond to these developments,
we may lose competitive position, and our other products may become uncompetitive or obsolete, causing our business and prospects to
suffer.
In
order to compete, we need to adjust, develop, license or acquire new technology on a schedule that keeps pace with technological and
other developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of needs.
Fluctuation
in the value of foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on your investment.
A
substantial portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies, such as the British Pound, Australian Dollar
or Japanese Yen. Any significant change in value of these foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may materially affect our cash flows,
net revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our common stock in U.S. dollars. For
example, an appreciation of any such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar would make any new investments or expenditures denominated
in the foreign currency costlier to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into the foreign currency for such purposes.
Conversely, a significant depreciation of any such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar
equivalent of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our common stock. If we decide to convert any such foreign
currency into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common stock, strategic acquisitions or investments
or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currency would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar
amount available to us. We do not expect to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and, therefore, exchange
rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have
a material adverse effect on your investment.
33
We
are subject to laws and regulations governing business conduct, which will require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.
We
must comply with a wide range of laws and regulations to prevent corruption, bribery, and other unethical business practices, including
the FCPA, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other countries. The creation and implementation of international business practices
compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. Anti-bribery
laws prohibit us, our employees, and some of our agents or representatives from offering or providing any personal benefit to covered
government officials to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests other than the missions of the
public organizations in which they serve. Certain commercial bribery rules also prohibit offering or providing any personal benefit to
employees and representatives of commercial companies to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests
other than their employers. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain
accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation,
including international subsidiaries, and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the Department of Justice. The SEC is involved with enforcement of
the books and records provisions of the FCPA. Compliance with these anti-bribery laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries
in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the anti-bribery laws present particular challenges in the medical products
industries because in many countries, a majority of hospitals are state-owned or operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital
employees are considered civil servants. Furthermore, in certain countries, hospitals and clinics are permitted to sell medical devices
to their patients and are primary or significant distributors of medical devices. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical
studies, procurement of medical devices and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials that have led
to vigorous anti-bribery law enforcement actions and heavy fines in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in the United States and China.
It is not always possible to identify and deter violations, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be
effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or
lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In the medical products industries, corrupt practices
include, among others, acceptance of kickbacks, bribes or other illegal gains or benefits by the hospitals and medical practitioners
from medical device manufacturers, distributors or their third-party agents in connection with the prescription of certain medical devices
or disposables. If our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal
practices with respect to their sales or marketing of our products or other activities involving our products, we could be required to
pay damages or heavy fines by multiple jurisdictions where we operate, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations. Our potential customers also may deny access to sales representatives from medical device companies because
the potential customers want to avoid the perception of corruption, which could adversely affect our ability to promote our products.
As we expand our operations in the APAC Region, we will need to increase the scope of our compliance programs to address the risks relating
to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Our compliance programs will need to include
policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in multiple jurisdictions,
including provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and will need to include effective training
for our personnel throughout our organization. The creation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance programs is costly and such
programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. Violation of the FCPA and other anti-corruption
laws can result in significant administrative and criminal penalties for us and our employees, including substantial fines, suspension
or debarment from government contracting, prison sentences, or even the death penalty in extremely serious cases in certain countries.
The SEC also may suspend or bar us from trading securities on United States exchanges for violation of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
Even if we are not ultimately punished by government authorities, the costs of investigation and review, distraction of company personnel,
legal defense costs, and harm to our reputation could be substantial and could limit our profitability or our ability to develop or launch
our product candidates. In addition, if any of our competitors are not subject to the FCPA, they may engage in practices that will lead
to their receipt of preferential treatment from potential customers and enable them to secure business from potential customers in ways
that are unavailable to us.
Changes
in the economic, political or social conditions or government policies in our target markets could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operations.
The
economies and societies of certain countries and territories of our target markets, continue to undergo significant change. Adverse changes
in the political and economic policies in these countries and territories could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic
growth of these countries and territories, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in these countries and territories.
The governments of these countries and territories continue to adjust economic policies to promote economic growth. Some of these measures
may benefit the overall economy but may also have a negative effect on us. As the medical product industry grows and evolves in these
countries and territories, the governments may also implement measures to change the structure of foreign investment in this industry.
We are unable to predict any such policy changes, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance or conduct
our business in these countries and territories. Any failure on our part to comply with changing government regulations and policies
could result in the loss of our ability to develop and launch our product candidates in these countries and territories.

Risks
Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock
The Company may not be able to repay the
grant it received from the Australian Government on time.
In the fourth fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2025, upon the end of the project deadline for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Australia, a grant acquittal
audit was completed by an independent auditor in relation to the grant received from the Australian Government. Following the grant acquittal
audit, an amount of $2,172,108 remains payable to the Australian Government, which is disclosed under liabilities in the balance sheet
as of June 30, 2025, as “Accounts payable and accrued expenses”. The terms of repayments have not been finalized as of June
30, 2025. Should the Australian government require the payment upfront or the repayment terms are not favorable to the Company, the Company
may not be able to repay the liability on time.
If we are unable to maintain compliance
with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to trade in our securities.
Our
common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements
with respect to the market value of publicly held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder’s
equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements,
we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
We
have in the past, and we may again in the future, fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market,
which would subject our common stock to being delisted. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to
raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors
to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative
results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development
opportunities.
We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is
not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of
internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations,
which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, we identified material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
The
material weaknesses related to the fact that the Company has not yet designed and maintained an effective control environment commensurate
with its financial reporting requirements, including (a) that the Company had not yet completed the formally documented policies and
procedures with respect to the review, supervision and monitoring of the Company’s accounting and reporting functions, (b) the
lack of evidence to support the performance of controls and the adequacy of review procedures, including the completeness and accuracy
of information used in the performance of controls and (c) we currently have limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources
necessary to adequately execute the Company’s accounting processes and address its internal controls over financial reporting.
We
have implemented and are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to
remediate these material weaknesses, including the hiring of additional qualified accounting and finance personnel, enhancing our controls
to improve the preparation and review of complex accounting measurements and the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
in the United States (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”), and engaging independent experts and outside consultants.
We
cannot assure you that the measures we have taken and that we intend to take will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses
we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. While we believe that our efforts will enhance our internal control,
remediation of the material weaknesses will require further validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal
controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will
not in the future have additional, material weaknesses.
35
We
are obligated to develop and maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis
of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective,
which may harm investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
As
a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such
internal controls. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other
things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material
weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. However, our auditors will not be required
to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer
an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, if we take advantage of the exemptions available to us through the
JOBS Act. Even after we cease to be an “emerging growth company,” our auditors will not be required to formally attest to
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting unless we are an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer (as
defined under the Exchange Act). We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and process
documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate
internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control
over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning
as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. As we transition
to the requirements of reporting as a public company, we may need to add additional finance staff. We may not be able to complete our
evaluation and testing in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. We may not be
able to remediate any material weaknesses in a timely fashion. If we are unable to complete our evaluation and testing, or if we are
unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, particularly if we have been unable to remediate any
material weaknesses identified, or if or our auditors, when required to do so, are unable to express an opinion that our internal controls
are effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could harm our stock
price.
We
are an emerging growth company and currently have limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources. This can result in a
lack of necessary resources to adequately execute our accounting processes and address our internal controls over financial reporting
requirements.
The
Company is an emerging growth company. Prior to our initial public offering (“IPO”), which we completed in December 2020,
the Company was a private corporation with limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources necessary to adequately execute
its accounting processes and address its internal controls over financial reporting requirements. As a result, previously existing internal
controls are no longer sufficient, and the Company is in the process of updating these controls. The design and implementation of internal
control over financial reporting for the Company’s post-IPO has required and will continue to require significant time and resources
from management and other personnel.
Raising
additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies
or products.
Since
our inception, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our convertible preferred stock and common
stock, indebtedness and revenue from the sales of our products. We anticipate our future capital requirements will be substantial and
that we will need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operations through equity or debt financing, or some combination
thereof. We are currently exploring fundraising opportunities to meet these capital requirements. If we are unable to raise additional
funding to meet our operational needs, we will be forced to limit or cease our operations.
In
addition to our current capital needs, we regularly consider fundraising opportunities and may decide, from time to time, to raise capital
based on various factors, including market conditions and our plans of operation. We may seek funds through borrowings or through additional
rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings. Additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable
terms on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, or if the terms of potential funding sources are unfavorable,
our business and our ability to develop our technology and our products would be harmed. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity
securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.
In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to
those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, is likely to involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in
conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities
receive any distribution of our corporate assets. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or others
that may require us to relinquish rights or jointly own some aspects of our technologies or products that we would otherwise pursue on
our own.
36
The
market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile.
The
market price for our common stock may be significantly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the
following:
●
developments
prior to commercial sales relating to regulatory approval, manufacturing and distribution of our products;
●
actual
or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;
●
changes
in financial or operational estimates or projections;
●
conditions
in markets generally;
●
changes
in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and
●
general
economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.
In
particular, the market prices for securities of medical device companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors
that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:
●
any
delay in or the results of our clinical evaluations;
●
any
delay in manufacturing of our products;
●
any
delay with the approval for reimbursement for the patients from their insurance companies;
●
our
failure to comply with regulatory requirements;
●
the
announcements of clinical evaluation data, and the investment community’s perception of and reaction to those data;
●
the
results of clinical evaluations conducted by others on products that would compete with ours;
●
any
delay or failure to receive clearance or approval from regulatory agencies or bodies;
●
our
inability to commercially launch products or market and generate sales of our products,
●
failure
our products, even if approved for marketing, to achieve any level of commercial success;
●
our
failure to obtain intellectual property protection for any of our technologies and products or the issuance of third-party intellectual
property that cover our proposed technologies or products;
●
developments
or disputes concerning our product’s intellectual property rights;
●
our
or our competitors’ technological innovations;
●
general
and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our expenditures;
●
changes
in market valuations of similar companies;
37
●
announcements
by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new
technologies, or intellectual property;
●
failure
to adequately manufacture our other products through third parties;
●
future
sales of our common stock or other securities, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or otherwise issued
pursuant to certain contractual rights;
●
period-to-period
fluctuations in our financial results; and
●
low
or high trading volume of our common stock due to many factors, including the terms of our financing arrangements.
In
addition, if we fail to reach an important research, development or commercialization milestone or result by a publicly expected deadline,
even if by only a small margin, there could be a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Additionally, as we approach
the announcement of anticipated significant information and as we announce such information, we expect the price of our common stock
to be volatile and negative results would have a substantial negative impact on the price of our common stock. In some cases, following
periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities
litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention
and resources, which could significantly harm our business operations and reputation.
We
incur significantly increased costs and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company,
which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.
As
a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we will incur significant legal,
accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations
impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time
to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult
and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for
us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. Furthermore, new or changing laws, regulations and standards are
subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may
evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding
compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We cannot predict or estimate
the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs. Moreover, our executive officers have little
experience in operating a United States public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations
uncertain. Our failure to company with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to United States public companies could subject us
or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price.
38
We may have difficulties integrating acquired
businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
The
success of the acquisition of IFP will depend on, among other things, the combined Company’s ability to realize these anticipated
benefits from combining the businesses of INBS and IFP. The combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition
for a variety of reasons, including the following:
●inability to efficiently
operate new businesses or to integrate acquired products;
●failure to successfully
manage relationships with customers, distributors, and suppliers;
●failure of customers
to accept new products or to continue as customers of the combined company;
●potential incompatibility
of technologies and systems;
●failure to leverage
the increased scale of the combined company quickly and effectively;
●potential difficulties
integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;
●difficulties in
retaining key employees of the acquired business;
●failure of the
acquired business to produce the expected value; and
●failure to effectively
coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the combined company.

ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY.
There
have been an increasing number of cyberattacks on companies around the world, which have caused operational failures, compromised sensitive
corporate or customer data, and/or resulted in significant financial damages. These attacks have occurred over the internet, through
malware, viruses or attachments to e-mails, or through inside actors with access to systems within the organization.
Risk
Management and Strategy
We
have recently implemented additional security measures as part of an evolving cybersecurity posture and will continue to devote resources
to address security vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent cyberattacks and mitigate the damage that could result from such an attack.
All employees received cybersecurity training and other education regarding their use of computers, information technology, and sensitive
data including specifically how to recognize common attack strategies. As many of our applications are developed and managed by third
parties, we are dependent on these providers for many functions including disaster recovery during a disaster or cyber incident. Our
goal is to only utilize the most secure and trusted providers for our IT needs. To this end, we are currently reviewing the security
credentials and certifications of our key application providers. Our business continuity plans are evaluated against evolving security
and service level standards, which includes evaluating those cybersecurity threats associated with our use of key third party service
providers.
39
Our
current cybersecurity management strategy consists of utilizing a combination of employee education, preventative controls, detective
controls, and periodic cybersecurity testing. Our process and cybersecurity posture will continue to be refined based on the results
of periodic cybersecurity assessments conducted internally and with our IT consultants and service providers, as needed. We have recently
begun reporting on cybersecurity in reports to the Board of Directors and will continue to do so.
Governance
The
Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of cybersecurity risk. Our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer are the
members of management responsible for managing and assessing our cybersecurity practices and have commenced reporting on such practices
and risks. The plan for the future is that they will continue to report to the Board on cybersecurity at least quarterly. Should any
cybersecurity threat or incident be detected, our senior management team would timely report such threat or incident to the Board of
Directors and provide regular communications and updates throughout the incident and any subsequent investigation, in order that the
impact, materiality, and reporting requirements of such incident are appropriately identified and assessed for further necessary or appropriate
action to be taken. We believe we are appropriately staffed (as supported by IT consultants and service providers, as needed) to support
a healthy cybersecurity posture given our size and scope.
Our
Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, is directly responsible for IT functions and has extensive experience
as a chief financial officer, chief operating officer and special projects lead, with expertise in accounting, taxation, business advisory,
business risks identification and management and business systems designs across many industries, including the application of IFRS and
US GAAP for the life science industry.
To
date, there have been no risks identified from cybersecurity threats or previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. However, despite all of the above aforementioned efforts, a cyberattack, if
it occurred, could cause system operational problems, compromise important data or systems or result in an unintended release of confidential
information. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks impacting our Company.
ITEM
2. PROPERTIES.
Our
company currently operates out of three strategically located facilities, which cater to different aspects of our business:
Sydney, Australia: We rent an office/warehouse
space of approximately 2,080 sq. ft. Our office/warehouse facility serves three fundamental purposes. First, it provides a dedicated
office space for our administrative staff, who are responsible for managing and overseeing INBS operations. Second, the facility houses
our new Australian sales and marketing team, offering them both office and warehouse space. Third, the location functions as a distribution
hub for expanding sales across the Asia-Pacific market, optimizing our logistics and reach in the region.
Cambridge, England: We rent a multifunctional
facility in the UK consisting of approximately 11,500 sq. ft, which is integral to our global operations. It houses office space, a warehouse,
research and development (R&D), and manufacturing capabilities, catering to the UK market and our global supply needs. Currently,
our manufacturing facility can produce up to 90,000 cartridges per month. Our production rate stands at approximately 12,000 cartridges
per month, providing ample room for growth in the coming years.
New
York City, United States: We have a small, shared office space in New York that accommodates our two US employees, fostering closer
collaboration and communication. This location provides a focal point for our global operations and solidifies our presence and commitment
to the US market.
We
have no immediate plans to upgrade or expand our facilities, given that they are currently adequately meeting our needs. However, we
are open to establishing permanent offices for regional heads as required in the future, ensuring that we are well-positioned to adapt
and grow as our business evolves.

Information
Our
common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “INBS”.
Holders
As of August 12, 2025, there are approximately
485 holders of record of our common stock. As many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of
shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of individual shareholders represented by the record holders.
Dividends
We
have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we currently expect that, for the foreseeable future, all earnings (if any)
will be retained for the development of our business and no dividends will be declared or paid. In the future, our Board of Directors
may decide, at their discretion, whether dividends may be declared and paid, taking into consideration, among other things, our earnings
(if any), operating results, financial condition and capital requirements, general business conditions and other pertinent facts, including
restrictions imposed by foreign jurisdictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us.

herein. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. “Risk Factors”
and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We
caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made.
In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.
These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this report, and while we believe such information forms
a reasonable basis for such. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly
update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any
such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
To
supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, we present “contribution
margin” and “contribution margin %”, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Contribution margin and contribution margin
% are presented in the section titled “Contribution Margin (non-GAAP)”. We have also included reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
These
non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies,
limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of contribution and contribution margin is provided for year-over-year
comparison purposes. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial
performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business
performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.
Overview
Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. and its wholly
owned Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc., were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company’s
Australian subsidiary, Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd, was formed on August 4, 2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia
and was renamed to Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd on January 6, 2023. On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting
Limited (“IFP”), a company registered in England and Wales. The Company’s headquarters are in New York, New York.
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing and
screening solutions. The Company operates globally with the objective of providing innovative and accessible solutions that improve the
quality of life.
The
Company’s current product portfolio includes:
●
Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform: The Company’s current active product is the Intelligent Fingerprinting Platform, which consists of the proprietary portable platform that analyzes fingerprint sweat using a one-time cartridge and portable handheld reader. The flagship product from this platform, which is commercially available in certain countries outside of the United States, is the Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug Screening System (the “IFP System” or “IFP Products”), a two-part system that consists of non-invasive, fingerprint sweat-based diagnostic testing products designed to detect drugs of abuse including opiates, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone, and buprenorphine. The IFP System comprises a small, tamper-evident drug screening cartridge onto which ten fingerprint sweat samples are collected in under a minute before the portable analysis unit provides an on-screen result in under ten minutes. Samples collected with a confirmatory kit can also be sent to a third-party laboratory service provider for confirmation testing. Customers include safety-critical industries such as construction, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, engineering, drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, and judicial organizations.
42
We
plan to bring the IFP System to new markets and grow within existing markets concentrating on:
●increasing
market share across the United Kingdom and mainland Europe;
●commencing
sales and distribution throughout Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the Asia
Pacific Region (“APAC Region”), and establishing the infrastructure and satisfying
the regulatory requirements needed to do so;
●continue
to work on 510(k) pre-market notification submitted on December 2024 for expansion into United
States markets that require FDA clearance, followed by the planned initial launch of our
opiate test system for codeine and then for additional drugs following such additional FDA
clearance as may be required
●initiating
research aimed at broadening the capabilities of the IFP System to test for additional drugs
and indications, facilitating the expansion of the platform into point-of-care medical testing;
●expanding
the IFP System into new customer segments, including major sporting organizations, law enforcement,
and commercial airlines; and
●developing
a strategic network of distributors with established customer bases throughout the APAC Region,
Europe and North America to distribute the IFP Products.
●
Biosensor Platform: Under the terms of an Amended and Restated License Agreement dated September 12, 2019 (the “BPT License Agreement”), between the Company and Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or “Licensor”), the Company held an exclusive license in the Asia Pacific Region (“APAC Region”) to the Licensor’s proprietary rights to the biosensor technology (the “Biosensor IP”) used in the biosensor platform we refer to as the Biosensor Platform Technology (“BPT”), or simply the “Biosensor Platform”. This platform consists of a small, printable modified organic thin-film transistor strip designed to detect multiple biological analytes by substituting the top enzyme layer of the biosensor to suit each analyte. We refer to products that use the BPT as the “Licensed Products”. This platform technology has the potential to develop a range of Point of Care Tests. We understand that following the appointment of a liquidator to LSBD on July 21, 2023, the Biosensor IP we licensed from LSBD has reverted back to the University of Newcastle. Following our ongoing discussions with the University, it is the Company’s understanding that the University of Newcastle cannot finalize licensing of the Biosensor IP until the liquidation of LSBD is complete. As the timeline for the completion of LSBD’s liquidation is unknown, the Company does not expect any updates or finalization of any license terms until this occurs. As a result, further development of the BPT has been postponed until we are able to finalize licensing arrangements related to the BPT.

Comparison
of the Years Ended June 30, 2025, and 2024
Revenue
Sales
of goods
Revenue from sales of goods decreased by $59,249
to $3,052,532 from $3,111,781 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to same period in 2024. This decrease is mainly due to instability
in the construction sector in our primary market, the UK which has resulted in the lower number of readers being sold during the period.
Revenue
from IFP Products relates to the sale of readers, cartridges and accessories and is summarized as follows:

Cost of revenue increased by $119,518 to $1,805,673
from $1,686,155 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to same period in 2024. The increase in cost of revenue is mainly due to an
increase in direct labor cost due to annual salary revision for direct manufacturing labor during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and
direct overhead costs. The following table shows the composition of cost of revenue.

Government
support income
Government support income in the United Kingdom
and Australia geographic segments increased by $392,125 to $816,901 from $424,776 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to same period
in 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to the Company’s investment in qualifying research and development expenditures
for research and development government subsidies and unwinding of the grant income in the fourth fiscal quarter of FY 2024-25 upon the
completion of the grant acquittal audit.
The grant support income is primarily attributable
to INBS’s subsidiary companies recognizing an R&D tax refund as the Company believes there is a reasonable assurance that the
certain amount will be recovered in full through future claims (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information and disclosures relating R&D tax refund).
Operating
expenses
Selling,
general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $374,579 to $8,883,917
from $9,258,496 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in
legal, insurance, and general overhead costs offset by an increase in advertising, marketing and travel costs.
As the Company’s operating activities increase,
we expect its selling, general and administrative expenses will include additional costs in overhead contribution, consultancy, as well
as an increase in employee-related costs associated with a higher headcount. We aim to increase our cost efficiency as we streamline the
business and implement changes, delivering increased value for investors.
46
Development
and regulatory approval expenses
Development and regulatory approval expenses increased
by $722,707 to $2,396,513 from $1,673,806 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This increase is primarily
driven by the increased expenditure on R&D activities as the Company undertook multiple clinical trials and filed for FDA 510 (k)
clearance.
During the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company
partnered with CenExel Research, a third party Clinical Research Organization (CRO), and completed a method comparison clinical study
on its IFP System.
We expect development and regulatory expenses
to increase in future periods, as the Company aims to conduct future studies for additional drugs of abuse.
Depreciation
and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased by $6,601 to $1,207,875 from $1,201,274
for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to same period in 2024. This increase is mainly due to the fluctuation in the foreign exchange
rate for conversion of the account balances.
Impairment
of long-lived assets
The Impairment of long-lived assets increased
by $220,062 to $220,062 from $0 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. The increase is mainly due to the
impairment of construction in progress (CIP) assets. Refer to Note 7 of financial reports for details.
Other
income and expenses
Interest
expense
Interest expense decreased by $106,250 to $60,890 from $167,140 for the
year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. This decrease was attributable to the reduction of the interest recorded
for leased assets and notes payable as the leases are nearing its termination date.
Realized
foreign exchange loss
Realized foreign exchange loss decreased by $267 to $911 from $1,178 for
the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This decrease was largely attributable to favorable exchange rates
while settling transactions in currencies other than its functional currencies.
Fair
value gain on revaluation of financial instruments
The fair value gain decreased by $175,738 to $0 from $175,738 for the year
ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024.  This decrease is due to the revaluation gain on contingent consideration
for holdback Series C Preferred Stock resulting from the acquisition of IFP. The holdback Series C Preferred Stock shares were converted
into common stock in October 2023. There was no fair value revaluation gain or loss on financial instruments for the year ended June 30,
2025.
Interest
income
Interest income increased by $16,700 to $101,522 from $84,822 for the year
ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was attributable to funds received from capital raising activities,
which contributed to the balance on which interest was earned.
47
Income
tax (expense) benefit
There
was no income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, as the Company has established a full valuation
allowance for all its deferred tax assets.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”), signed into
law on July 4, 2025, introduces amendments to U.S. tax laws with various effective dates. Key tax-related provisions of the OBBBA include
changes to bonus depreciation, research and development expenditures, interest expense deductibility, and revisions to international tax
regimes. The Company is currently assessing the future implications of these tax law changes.
Other
comprehensive income (loss)
Foreign currency translation gain (loss)
Unrealized foreign currency translation gain increased by $521,788 to a
gain of $384,670 from a loss of $137,118 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This is due to the favorable exchange rate calculated based on the
Company’s unsettled transactions in currencies other than its functional currency and translation of assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries in reporting currency.
Net
loss attributable to INBS
Net loss attributable to INBS increased by $411,974
to $10,568,733 from $10,156,759 for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.
This increase is primarily driven by increase
in development and regulatory approval expenses as the Company ran multiple clinical trials for submission to the FDA and impairment of
the available for sale assets during the year.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
use working capital and cash measures to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations.
We define Working Capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for any standardized measure under US GAAP. This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity. Other
companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Since our inception, we have financed our operations
primarily though proceeds from public offerings and private placements of equity securities, existing trade and shareholder financing
arrangements, and the incurrence of debt. As of June 30, 2025, we had $1,019,909 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital deficit
of $1,212,419.
At the Market (ATM) Offering - On September 18, 2024, the Company entered
into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. (“Ladenburg”).
Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through Ladenburg, as sales agent and/or principal,
shares of the Company’s common stock, with an aggregate sales price of up to $3.0 million. On March 11, 2025, the Company filed
a prospectus supplement (the “2025 ATM Supplement”) to the ATM Prospectus (defined below) in connection with the offer, sale,
and issuance of additional shares. During the period between September 18, 2024, through to June 30, 2025, the Company raised approximately
$2,251,540 (net of commissions of approximately $69,637 paid to Ladenburg) through the sale and issuance of 1,434,659 shares of Company
common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. During the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company raised approximately $765,201 (net
of commissions of approximately $23,666 paid to Ladenburg) through the sale and issuance of 514,296 shares of Company common stock pursuant
to the ATM Agreement. Any sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement are made under the Company’s effective “shelf”
registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264218), which became effective on April 20, 2022, and included base prospectus, and
under the related prospectus supplement (the “ATM Prospectus”) filed with the SEC, dated September 18, 2024, as supplemented
by the 2025 ATM Supplement filed with the SEC on March 11, 2025.
February Offering - On February 20, 2025, the Company entered into an underwriting
agreement with Ladenburg, as representative (the “February Representative”) for the underwriters named in Schedule 1 thereto
(collectively, the “February Underwriters”) relating to an underwritten public offering of 1,304,348 shares of the Company’s
common stock. The public offering price for each share was $2.00 per share and the February Underwriters agreed to purchase 1,304,348
shares (the “February Offering”). The Company granted the February Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase an additional
195,652 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $2.00 per share, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On February
20, 2025, the February Representative fully exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 195,652 shares of common stock.
All of the shares were sold by the Company. The February Offering closed on February 21, 2025. As a result of the over-allotment option
being exercised in full, the Company raised approximately $2,645,000 (net of underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $355,000).
The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents
as of June 30, 2025, may be insufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve months
from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. Accordingly,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds during the next 12 months.  For more information regarding the repayment of a grant the Company received from the Australian Government,
see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The Company may not be able to repay the grant it received from the Australian Government on time.”
However, there can be no assurances that we will
be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital through
debt or equity financing, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements, could have
a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business plan. Our failure
to obtain such funding when needed could create a negative impact on our stock price or could potentially lead to a reduction in our operations
or the failure of our Company. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern unless it can successfully raise additional capital.
48
Extended
Transition Period for “Emerging Growth Companies”
We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of
the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance
or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
As
of June 30, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period
in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the
revision affects both current and future periods.
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and
incorporated herein by reference, describes the Company’s accounting policies. The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with Note 3, as it presents uncertainties involved in applying the accounting policies and provides insight into the quality of management’s
estimates and variability in the amounts recorded for these critical accounting estimates. While all accounting policies impact the consolidated
financial statements, certain policies may be viewed to be critical. Management believes that the accounting policies which involve more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include research and development
tax refunds.
We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
Revenue
recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies its performance obligations
by delivering the promised goods or service deliverables to the customers. A good or service deliverable is transferred to a customer
when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service deliverable.
Grant
income
Accounting
for the grant income does not fall under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as the Australian Government will not
benefit directly from our manufacturing facility. As there is no authoritative guidance under US GAAP on accounting for grants to for-profit
business entities, we applied International Accounting Standards 20 (“IAS 20”), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure
of Government Assistance by analogy when accounting for the Australian Government grant to the Company.
49
The
Australian Government grant proceeds, which will be used to reimburse construction costs incurred, meet the definition of grants related
to assets as the primary purpose for the payments is to fund the construction of a capital asset. Under IAS 20, government grants related
to assets are presented in the statement of financial position either by setting up the grant as deferred income that is recognized in
the statement of operation on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying
amount of the asset. Either of these two methods of presentation of grants related to assets in financial statements are regarded as
acceptable alternatives under IAS 20. The Company has elected to record the grants received initially as deferred income and deducting
the grant proceeds received from the gross costs of the assets or construction in progress (“CIP”) and the deferred grant
income liability.
In the fourth fiscal quarter
of 2025, upon the end of the project deadline for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Australia, a grant acquittal audit was
completed by an independent auditor in relation to the grant received from the Australian Government. The amounted owed to the Australian
Government was determined as $2,172,108, which is disclosed under liabilities in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, as “Accounts
payable and accrued expenses”.
A total of $271,780 and $0
deferred grant income was recognized within other income during the year ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 respectively.
Inventories,
net
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, other costs that have
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. General market conditions, as
well as the Company’s research activities, can cause certain of its products to become obsolete. The Company writes down excess
and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected demand. The determination
of projected demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected sales for each product. These write downs can
influence results from operations.
Impairment
of Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets. Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future
cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of impairment is calculated as the difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the asset.
In the fourth fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2025, upon the completion of the project deadline for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Australia, the construction
in progress assets acquired specifically for the manufacturing facilities were evaluated for alternative uses. It was determined that
these assets had no alternative use to the Company. Consequently, management concluded this event to be an indicator of impairment and
initiated an assessment for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. As part of this assessment, management
decided to dispose these assets and obtained offers from interested third parties. The Company determined the fair value of the construction
in progress using the market approach and concluded that the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value. Therefore, the Company
recognized an impairment loss of $220,062 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. There was no impairment loss recognized during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
50
R&D
Tax Refund
The Company measures the research
and development grant income and receivable by calculating the time spent by employees and costs incurred to external service providers
on eligible research and development activities. The research and development tax refund receivable is recognized as the Company believes
that there is a reasonable assurance the amount will be recovered in full through future claims.
Intellectual
property acquired for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses (in other research and development
projects or otherwise) are expensed in research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred.
In
certain circumstances, the Company may be required to make advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in
the future for use in R&D activities. In such circumstances, the non-refundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even
when there is no alternative future use for the R&D, until the related goods or services are provided. In circumstances where amounts
have been paid in excess of costs incurred, the Company records a prepaid expense.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of June 30, 2025. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.
Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to the material weakness in internal control
over financial reporting discussed below.
Notwithstanding this conclusion, we believe that
our consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material
respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
52
Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a
-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including
the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate
misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate
for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial
reporting.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2025, due to the material weaknesses
described below.
Material
Weakness
In
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, management identified material
weaknesses in control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring. Specifically, the
material weaknesses identified relate to the fact that the Company has not yet designed and maintained an effective control environment
commensurate with its financial reporting requirements, including (a) has not yet completed formally documenting policies and procedures
with respect to review, supervision and monitoring of the Company’s accounting and reporting functions, (b) lack of evidence to
support the performance of controls and the adequacy of review procedures, including the completeness and accuracy of information used
in the performance of controls and (c) we have limited accounting personnel and other supervisory resources necessary to adequately execute
the Company’s accounting processes and address its internal controls over financial reporting.
Ongoing
Remediation Plan
Management
is committed to continuing the steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the above material weaknesses.
We made the following enhancements and continue to make progress to enhance our control environment:
●
We added accounting and finance personnel to provide additional individuals to allow for segregation of duties in the preparation and
review of schedules, calculations and journal entries that support financial reporting, to provide oversight, structure and reporting
lines to provide additional review over our disclosures. We have also commenced the implementation of the new accounting system which
aids in reducing these control deficiencies;
●
We enhanced our controls to improve the preparation and review of complex accounting measurements, the application of US GAAP to significant
accounts and transactions and our financial statement disclosures;
●
We engage independent experts when complex transactions are entered into;
●
We have recruited and plan to recruit additional financial reporting and accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of US GAAP and
SEC rules;
●
We are in the process of engaging outside consultants to assist us in our evaluation of the design, implementation and documentation
of internal controls that address the relevant risks, to provide appropriate evidence of performance of our internal controls (including
completeness and accuracy procedures); and
●
We completed the implementation of new accounting system for Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. and Intelligent Bio Solutions APAC that will
enhance our internal controls by improving efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in financial reporting and data management. Additionally,
we have also commenced implementing new accounting system for our subsidiary Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited and have planned to complete
it by the third quarter of fiscal 2026.
Under the direction of the Audit Committee of our board of directors, management will continue
to take measures to remediate the material weaknesses. As such, we will continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls
and structures to ensure that there is an appropriate assignment of authority, responsibility and accountability to enable remediation
of our material weakness.
As
we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional
measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the ongoing remediation effort, described above, there have been no changes
to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
Inherent
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company
have been detected.

Endocrinology at Westmead Hospital, from February 1990 to December 1999. During this time, Dr. Boyages’ major achievements were

government relations and regulatory affairs.

Corporate
Governance
Overview
We set high standards for
the Company’s employees, officers, and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. We
regularly monitor developments in the area of corporate governance and review our processes, policies and procedures in light of such
developments. Key information regarding our corporate governance initiatives can be found on the Governance section of our website, www.ibs.inc,
including our Code of Ethics (“Code of Ethics”) and the charters for our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committees. We believe that our corporate governance policies and practices, including the majority of independent directors
on our Board, empower our independent directors to effectively oversee our management—including the performance of our Chief Executive
Officer—and provide an effective and appropriately balanced board governance structure and provide an effective and appropriately
balanced board governance structure. The information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference in,
or considered part of this report.
Independence
of the Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors has
determined that each of our directors is an independent director (as currently defined in Rule 5605(a) of the Nasdaq listing rules).
In determining the independence
of our directors, the Board considered all transactions in which the Company and any director had any interest, including those discussed
under “Related Party Transactions” below. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence.”
All
our directors are independent. The independent directors meet as often as necessary to fulfil their responsibilities and will have regularly
scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Our
Board of Directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as
to provide effective oversight of management. Our Bylaws provide our Board with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of chairperson
of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.
The
Board believes that our optimal leadership framework at this time is to have Harry Simeonidis serve as President and Chief Executive
Officer, and to have the Board composed of a majority of independent directors. As a company in the highly regulated medical device and
product industries, we and our shareholders benefit from a chief executive officer with deep experience and leadership in, and knowledge
of, the medical device industry. In his role of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Simeonidis is responsible for handling
the day-to-day management direction of the Company, serving as a leader to the management team, and formulating corporate strategy.
Although
management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face, our Board of Directors and its committees take an active
role in overseeing management of our risks and has the ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management, including with regard
to cybersecurity. The Board of Directors regularly reviews information regarding our operational, financial, legal and strategic risks.
Specifically, senior management attends periodic meetings of the Board of Directors, provides presentations on operations including significant
risks, and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by our Board of Directors.
In
addition, we expect that committees will assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding risk. The
Audit Committee will coordinate the Board of Directors’ oversight of our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure
controls and procedures, related party transactions and code of conduct and corporate governance guidelines. Management will regularly
report to the Audit Committee on these areas. The Compensation Committee will assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities
with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs. When any of the committees receives a report
related to material risk oversight, the chairperson of the relevant committee will report on the discussion to the full Board of Directors.

by reference in, or considered part of this report.
Audit
Committee
We
have established an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3(a)58(A) of the Exchange Act, which consists
of Ms. Fraser, Mr. Boyages and Mr. Hurd, each of whom is an independent director under the Nasdaq listing standards applicable to audit
committees. Nicola Fraser qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in the rules and regulations established
by the SEC. Our Audit Committee oversees our corporate accounting, financial reporting practices and the audits of financial statements.
The Audit Committee’s duties, which are specified in the Audit Committee Charter, include, but not be limited to:
●
reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor
the annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the Board of Directors whether the audited financial statements should be
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K;
●
discussing
with management and the independent auditor significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation
of our financial statements;
●
discussing
with management major risk assessment and risk management policies;

verifying

57
●
pre-approving
all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditor, including the fees and terms of the

●
appointing
or replacing the independent auditor;
●
determining
the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and
the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; and
●
establishing
procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies.
Compensation
Committee
We have established a Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors that consists of Mr. Hurd, Mr. Isenberg and Mr. Boyages, each of whom is an independent director under
the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards applicable to compensation committees. The Compensation Committee’s duties, which are
specified in our Compensation Committee charter, include, but are not limited to:
●
reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our principal executive officer’s compensation,
evaluating our principal executive officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving
the remuneration (if any) of our principal executive officer based on such evaluation;
●
reviewing
and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;
●
reviewing
our executive compensation policies and plans;
●
implementing
and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;
●
assisting
management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;
●
approving
all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers
and employees;
●
if
required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and
●
reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.
The Compensation Committee
Charter also provides that the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
Compensation Committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the Nasdaq Stock Market
and the SEC. The Compensation Committee may delegate any or all of its responsibilities to a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee,
but only to the extent consistent with the Company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other applicable law and Nasdaq Stock
Market rules.
58
Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee
We have established a Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors that consists of Mr. Boyages, Mr. Hurd and Mr. Isenberg each of whom is an
independent director under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards applicable to nominating and corporate governance committees. The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Company’s
Board of Directors and accordingly recommends director nominees for the annual meeting of stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee also recommends and implements policies and procedures intended to assist the Board operations and all obligations to the Company
and its stockholders.
Guidelines
for Selecting Director Nominees:
The
guidelines for selecting nominees, generally provide that person to be nominated:
●
should
have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service;
●
should
possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the Board of Directors and bring
a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and
●
should
have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the stockholders.
The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience,
background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for membership on the Board of Directors. The Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific
board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and
diverse mix of board members. Though the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have specific guidelines on diversity,
it is one of many criteria considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when evaluating candidates. The Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by stockholders and other persons.
The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees for the Board recommended by stockholders in accordance with the
Company’s Bylaws. Stockholders wishing to propose Director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee may do so by writing, by deadlines specified in the Bylaws, to the Secretary of the Company and providing information concerning
the nominee and his or her proponent(s) required by the Bylaws. The Bylaws set forth further requirements for stockholders wishing to
nominate Director candidates for consideration by stockholders including, among other things, that a stockholder must give timely written
notice of an intent to make such a nomination to the Secretary of the Company.
59
Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Company has adopted
a written Code Ethics that applies to all officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. The Code Ethics is available on the Investors
- Governance section of our website at www.ibs.inc. If the Company makes any substantive amendments to the Code Ethics or grants any waiver
from a provision of the Code Ethics to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver
on our website. The information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference in, or considered part
of this report.
Insider
Trading Policy
We
have adopted an Insider Trading Policy that provides guidance to employees (including officers) and directors with respect to transactions
in the Company’s securities. The Insider Trading Policy is designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and
regulations and any listing standards applicable to the Company. The policy also prohibits directors, officers and other employees from
purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise
engaging in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of our equity securities
without our prior approval.
A copy of the Intelligent Bio Solutions, Inc. Insider Trading Policy is
filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this Annual Report on form 10-K.
Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports
Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered
class of the Company’s equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership
of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required
by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To the Company’s knowledge, based on a review of the copies of such

applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied.

●On June 30, 2025, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee of the Board, approved certain amendments (collectively, the “Amendments”) to the Employment Agreements, each dated
June 27, 2022, between Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, and each of Harry Simeondis, the Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Simeondis Employment Agreement”), and Spiro Sakiris, the Company’s Chief

Amendment”) and the amendment to the Sakiris Employment Agreement (the “Sakiris Amendment”) were each executed and became
effective as of June 30, 2025.
●The
Amendments modified the terms of each Employment Agreement to, among other things: (i) revise
the restricted period applicable to post-employment non-compete obligations, providing for
a tiered structure ranging from twenty-four (24) months down to one (1) month depending on
enforceability; (ii) expand the scope of non-compete restrictions to prohibit direct or indirect
involvement with any competing entity during the restricted period and within the restricted
area; and (iii) enhance severance benefits to provide that in the event of a termination
of employment by the Company without cause, the affected employee will be entitled to (a)
a cash payment equal to 100% of the potential bonus, irrespective of individual or Company
performance, payable at the same time as bonuses to similarly situated employees, and (b)
immediate full vesting of all outstanding equity awards, including unvested restricted stock,
as of the termination date, subject to applicable tax withholdings. If such a termination
occurs in connection with or following a Change in Control (as defined below) and without
cause, the employee will also receive (i) a cash payment equal to two times the employee’s
annual base salary, and (ii) an additional cash payment equal to 100% of the potential bonus,
both subject to applicable tax withholdings. A “Change in Control” is defined
to include: (i) the acquisition of more than 20% of the Company’s voting stock by a
person or group; (ii) certain mergers or consolidations resulting in a change in voting power;
(iii) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;
or (iv) changes in the majority composition of the Board, subject to specified exceptions.
An increase in stock ownership resulting from the Company’s purchasing of its own stock
is excluded from the definition of Change in Control.
●On June 30, 2025, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, also increased Mr. Simeondis’s annual base salary from USD$366,800 to USD$379,900, and increased Mr. Sakiris’s
annual base salary from USD$268,550 to USD$281,650 (based on the Spot Rate).
In addition, Mr. Sakiris and Mr.
Simeonidis are each eligible to receive an annual bonus of up to 20% of their respective gross base salaries, of which 50% will be based
on meeting company objectives and the remainder will be based on meeting mutually agreed employee objectives or as otherwise determined
by the Company.
We also make certain contributions
that are mandatory in Australia to a retirement fund for each of Mr. Sakiris and Mr. Simeonidis, known in Australia as a superannuation
fund, currently at the rate of 12% (was 11.5% during fiscal year ended June 30, 2025). We also provide an annual car allowance of $15,720
and $13,100 to Mr. Simeonidis and Mr. Sakiris respectively (based on the Spot Rate).
Each
of Mr. Sakiris and Mr. Simeonidis employment agreements is terminable on six months’ notice either by our subsidiary or by the
executive. However, we may terminate either executive without notice if he engages in serious or willful misconduct, is seriously negligent
in the performance of his duties, commits a serious or persistent breach of his employment agreement, brings our company into disrepute,
or is convicted of a criminal offense.
Each
of the above-described employment agreements contain provisions protecting the Company’s confidential information and intellectual
property. Each employment agreement also contains provisions restricting each executive’s ability to compete with the Company during
his employment and for a period of up to six months thereafter in a specified geographic region. The non-compete provisions will generally
impose restrictions on inducing the Company’s employees to leave the Company’s employment or soliciting clients of the Company.
Pursuant to each employment agreement, each executive must devote all of his time, attention and skill to the performance of his duties,
and neither executive may engage in any other business outside the Company without the Company’s prior written consent.
63
Superannuation
Fund
As required by Australian law, we contribute to standard defined contribution
superannuation funds on behalf of all our Australian employees at an amount required by law, which is currently 12% (was 11.5% during
fiscal year ended June 30, 2025) of each such employee’s salary. Superannuation is a compulsory savings program whereby employers
are required to pay a portion of an employee’s remuneration to an approved superannuation fund that the employee is typically not
able to access until they are retired. We permit employees to choose an approved and registered superannuation fund into which the contributions
are paid.
2019
Long Term Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan” or the “Plan”)
The
2019 Plan was adopted by the Board and approved by the Company’s stockholders on June 18, 2019. The purpose of the 2019 Plan is
to enable us to offer our employees, officers, directors and consultants whose past, present and/or potential future contributions to
us have been,
or will be important to our success, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in us. The various types of
incentive awards that may be provided under the 2019 Plan are intended to enable us to respond to changes in compensation practices,
tax laws, accounting regulations and the size and diversity of our business.
On February 8, 2023, the stockholders
of the Company approved an amendment 2019 Plan increasing the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan from
2,084 to 6,250 shares. On May 8, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment 2019 Plan increasing the aggregate number
of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan from 6,250 to 10,417 shares. On December 13, 2023, the stockholders of the Company
approved an amendment 2019 Plan increasing the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan from 10,417 to 133,334.
On May 8, 2025, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment 2019
Plan increasing the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan from 133,334 to 1,300,000 shares and increased
the limit on the maximum number of shares underlying awards to any non-employee director in any year to 50,000 shares in any year.
Administration
The
2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Subject to the provisions of the plan, the Compensation Committee determines,
among other things, the persons to whom from time to time awards may be granted, the specific type of awards to be granted, the number
of shares subject to each award, share prices, any restrictions or limitations on the awards, and any vesting, exchange, surrender, cancellation,
acceleration, termination, exercise or forfeiture provisions related to the awards.
Stock
Subject to the 2019 Plan
An aggregate of 1,300,000 shares of our common stock are available for
issuance under the 2019 Plan. Shares of stock subject to other awards that are forfeited or terminated will be available for future award
grants under the 2019 Plan. If a holder pays the exercise price of a stock option by surrendering any previously owned shares of common
stock or arranges to have the appropriate number of shares otherwise issuable upon exercise withheld to cover the exercise price or tax
withholding liability associated with the stock option exercise, the shares surrendered by the holder or withheld by us will not be available
for future award grants under the plan.
64
Under
the 2019 Plan, in the event of a change in the number of shares of our common stock as a result of a dividend on shares of common stock
payable in shares of common stock, common stock forward split or reverse split or other extraordinary or unusual event that results in
a change in the shares of common stock as a whole, the committee will determine whether such change equitably requires an adjustment
in the terms of any award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits available under the plan or the aggregate number
of shares reserved for issuance under the plan.
Eligibility
We may grant awards under the 2019 Plan to employees, officers, directors,
and consultants of the Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates who are deemed to have rendered, or to be able to render significant
services to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates and who are deemed to have contributed, or to have the potential to contribute, to our
success. An incentive stock option may be granted under the plan only to a person who, at the time of the grant, is an employee of ours
or our subsidiaries. Based on the current number of employees and consultants to the Company and on the current size of our Board of Directors,
we estimate that as of June 30, 2025, approximately 50 individuals are eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan.
Types
of Awards
Options. The 2019 Plan
provides both for “incentive” stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
the “Code,” and for options not qualifying as incentive options, both of which may be granted with any other stock-based award
under the plan. The committee determines the exercise price per share of common stock purchasable under an incentive or non-qualified
stock option, which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the day of the grant or, if greater, the par value of a share
of common stock. However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a person possessing more than 10% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of our stock may not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. The aggregate fair market
value of all shares of common stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable by a participant for the first time
during any calendar year (under all of our plans), measured at the date of the grant, may not exceed $100,000.
An
incentive stock option may only be granted within 10 years from the effective date of the 2019 Plan. An incentive stock option may only
be exercised within ten years from the date of the grant, or within five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a
person who, at the time of the grant, owns common stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
our stock.
Subject
to any limitations or conditions the committee may impose, stock options may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time during the
term of the stock option by giving written notice of exercise to us specifying the number of shares of common stock to be purchased.
The notice must be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, either in cash or, if provided in the agreement, in our securities
or in a combination of the two.
Generally,
stock options granted under the plan may not be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and all stock
options are exercisable, during the holder’s lifetime, only by the holder, or in the event of legal incapacity or incompetency,
the holder’s guardian or legal representative. However, a holder, with the approval of the committee, may transfer a non-qualified
stock option by gift to a family member of the holder or by domestic relations order to a family member of the holder or may transfer
a non-qualified stock option to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are owned by family members of the holder or
the holder.
Generally,
if the holder is an employee, no stock options granted under the plan may be exercised by the holder unless he or she is employed by
us or one of our subsidiaries or affiliates at the time of the exercise and has been so employed continuously from the time the stock
options were granted. However, in the event the holder’s employment is terminated due to disability or normal retirement, the holder
may still exercise his or her vested stock options for a period of 12 months, or such other greater or lesser period as the committee
may determine, from the date of termination or until the expiration of the stated term of the stock option, whichever period is shorter.
Similarly, should a holder die while employed by us or one of our subsidiaries or affiliates, his or her legal representative or legatee
under his or her will may exercise the decedent holder’s vested stock options for a period of 12 months from the date of his or
her death, or such other greater or lesser period as the Board or committee may determine, or until the expiration of the stated term
of the stock option, whichever period is shorter. If the holder’s employment is terminated for any reason other than death, disability
or normal retirement, the stock option will automatically terminate, except that if the holder’s employment is terminated by us
without cause, then the portion of any stock option that is vested on the date of termination may be exercised for the lesser of three
months after termination of employment, or such other greater or lesser period as the committee may determine but not beyond the balance
of the stock option’s term.
65
Stock
Appreciation Rights. Under the 2019 Plan, we may grant stock appreciation rights to participants who have been, or are being, granted
stock options under the plan as a means of allowing the participants to exercise their stock options without the need to pay the exercise
price in cash, or we may grant them alone and unrelated to an option. In conjunction with non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of the non-qualified stock options. In conjunction with incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights may be granted only at the time of the grant of the incentive stock options. A stock appreciation
right entitles the holder to receive a number of shares of common stock having a fair market value equal to the excess fair market value
of one share of common stock over the exercise price of the related stock option, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the stock
appreciation rights. The granting of a stock appreciation right in tandem with a stock option will not affect the number of shares of
common stock available for awards under the plan. In such event, the number of shares available for awards under the plan will, however,
be reduced by the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon exercise of the stock option to which the stock appreciation right
relates.
Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Units. Under the 2019 Plan, we may award shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are the
right to receive at a future date shares of common stock, or an amount in cash or other consideration determined by the committee to be
of equal value as of such settlement date, in accordance with the terms of such grant. The committee determines the persons to whom grants
of restricted stock or restricted stock units are made, the number of shares to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid for the restricted
stock or restricted stock units by the person receiving the stock from us, the time or times within which awards of restricted stock or
restricted stock units may be subject to forfeiture, the vesting schedule and rights to acceleration thereof, and all other terms and
conditions of the awards. Restrictions or conditions could also include, but are not limited to, the attainment of performance goals.
A holder of restricted stock units will have no rights of a stockholder with respect to shares subject to any restricted stock unit award
unless and until the shares are delivered in settlement of the award, except to the extent the committee provides for the right to receive
dividend equivalents.
Other
Stock-Based Awards. Under the 2019 Plan, we may grant other stock-based awards, subject to limitations under applicable law that
are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, shares of common stock,
as deemed consistent with the purposes of the plan. These other stock-based awards may be in the form of purchase rights, shares of common
stock awarded that are not subject to any restrictions or conditions, convertible or exchangeable debentures or other rights convertible
into shares of common stock and awards valued by reference to the value of securities of, or the performance of, one of us or one of
our subsidiaries. These other stock-based awards may include performance shares or options, whose award is tied to specific performance
criteria. These other stock-based awards may be awarded either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with any other awards under the 2019
Plan or any of our other plans.
Accelerated
Vesting and Exercisability
If
any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires the ownership of our stock that, together with the stock held by
such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or combined voting power of our stock, and the Board of
Directors does not authorize or otherwise approve such acquisition, then the vesting periods of any and all stock options and other awards
granted and outstanding under the 2019 Plan shall be accelerated and all such stock options and awards will immediately and entirely
vest, and the respective holders thereof will have the immediate right to purchase and/or receive any and all common stock subject to
such stock options and awards on the terms set forth in the plan and the respective agreements respecting such stock options and awards,
and all performance goals will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels. An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person,
or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which we acquire our stock in exchange for property is not treated as an
acquisition of stock.
66
In
the event of an acquisition by any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, together with acquisitions during the 12-month
period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons, of assets from us that have a total gross fair market
value equal to or more than 50% of the total gross fair market value of all of our assets immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions,
or if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires the ownership of our stock that, together with the stock held
by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or combined voting power of our stock, which has been
approved by the Board of Directors, the committee may (i) accelerate the vesting of any and all stock options and other awards granted
and outstanding under the 2019 Plan, (ii) require a holder of any award granted under the plan to relinquish such award to us upon the
tender by us to the holder of cash in an amount equal to the repurchase value of such award, and/or (iii) terminate all incomplete performance
periods in respect of awards in effect on the date the acquisition occurs, determine the extent to which performance goals have been
met based upon such information then available as it deems relevant and cause to be paid all or the applicable portion of the award based
upon the committee’s determination. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of our assets, or the value of the
assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
Terms
and Amendments
Unless
terminated by the Board, the 2019 Plan will continue to remain effective until no further awards may be granted, and all awards granted
under the plan are no longer outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, grants of incentive stock options may be made only until ten
years from the initial effective date of the plan. The Board may at any time, and from time to time, amend the plan or any award agreement,
but no amendment will be made that would impair the rights of a holder under any agreement entered into pursuant to the plan without
the holder’s consent.

Recoupment
Policy
We
adopted the Intelligent Bio Solutions, Inc. Dodd-Frank Restatement Recoupment Policy effective as of October 2, 2023. In the event that
we are required to prepare a financial restatement, the Compensation Committee will recoup all erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation
calculated on a pre-tax basis received after October 2, 2023, by a person (i) after beginning service as an executive officer, (ii) who
served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation, and (iii) during the
three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a restatement, and any transition
period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those
three completed fiscal years. “Clawback” or recoupment policy in our executive compensation program contributes to creating
and maintaining a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and reinforces the performance-based principles underlying our
executive compensation program.
Granting
of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of Material Nonpublic Information
We do not grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, or option-like instruments (collectively, “Option-Like Awards”) in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information and we do not time the public release of such information based on the grant dates of Option-Like Awards. During the last completed fiscal year, we have not awarded Option-Like Awards to any named executive officer during the period beginning four business days before and ending one business day after the filing of a period report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form 8-K, and we have not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS
The
following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our common stock as of August 12, 2025 by: (i) each director
and nominee for director; (ii) each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table; (iii) all executive officers and
directors of the Company as a group; and (iv) all those known by us to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of our common stock.
This
table is based upon information supplied by officers and directors as well as Schedules 13D or 13G filed with the SEC by beneficial owners
of more than five percent of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property
laws, where applicable, we believe that each of the stockholders named in this table has sole voting and investment power with respect
to the shares indicated as beneficially owned.
68
Applicable percentages are
based on 8,979,152 shares of our common stock outstanding on August 12, 2025. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the
rules of the SEC, which generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment
power with respect to those securities and includes shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options, warrants,
or other securities that are immediately exercisable or convertible or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of August 12, 2025. Unless
otherwise indicated, the people or entities identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
shown as beneficially owned by them. Except as otherwise set forth below, the address of the beneficial owner is c/o Intelligent Bio Solutions
Inc., 135 West, 41ST Street, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036.

and other information provided by the 13G Filers to the Company, including with regard to Alyeska Master Fund, LP (“Alyeska Fund,”
and together with the13G Filers, the “Reporting Persons”) or otherwise known to the Company. The reported amount consists
of 673,492 shares held by Reporting Persons and 248,333 shares underlying
warrants held by the Reporting Persons that are exercisable within 60 days of August 12, 2025, and fall within a 9.99% beneficial ownership
limitation.  The amount does not include (i) 793,697 shares underlying additional warrants held by the Reporting Persons that are exercisable
within 60 days of August 12, 2025, but are subject to a 9.99% beneficial ownership limitation, and (ii) 879,120 shares underlying additional warrants held by the Reporting Persons that are not currently exercisable. The 9.99% beneficial ownership limitation
restricts the Reporting Persons from exercising that portion of such warrants that would result in the Reporting Persons and their affiliates
from owning, after exercise, a number of shares of common stock in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation. Alyeska Group, the investment
manager of Alyeska Fund, has voting and investment control of the shares held by Alyeska Fund. Anand Parekh is the Chief Executive Officer
of Alyeska Group and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of such shares. Mr. Parekh, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership
of the shares held by Alyeska Fund.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Independence
of the Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors
has determined that each of our directors is an independent director (as currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing rules).
In determining the independence of our directors, the Board of Directors considered all transactions in which the Company and any director
had any interest, including those discussed under “Certain Related-Person Transactions” below.
Our
independent directors together constitute a majority of our full Board of Directors. The independent directors meet as often as necessary
to fulfil their responsibilities and will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Related-Person
Transactions
Our
Code of Ethics requires that we avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts
of interests, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Related party transactions are defined under SEC rules as transactions
in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed the lesser of  $120,000 or one percent of the average
of our total assets for the last two completed fiscal years, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive
officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock, or (c) immediate
family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than
solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity) (collectively, “Related Party Transactions”).
A conflict-of-interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his or her position.
Policies
and Procedures for Related Party Transactions
All
future and ongoing related party transactions (as defined under SEC rules) require prior review and approval by the Audit Committee,
which will have access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction without
the approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related
party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an
unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction.
No
director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide
the other members of the board with all material information concerning the transaction. Additionally, we require each of our directors
and executive officers to complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that elicits information about related party
transactions.
These
procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a
conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee, or officer.
Certain
Transactions with or Involving Related Persons
There were no Related
Party Transactions since the beginning of our last fiscal year, and there are no currently proposed transactions, to which we were or
are to be a participant.

Audit-related fees relate to professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements.
(3)
Tax fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to tax returns and tax audits, as well as for tax consulting and planning services.
(4)
All other fees relate to professional services not included in the categories above, including services related to other regulatory reporting requirements.
The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of services other
than audit services UHY is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant’s independence.
Pre-Approval
Policies and Procedures
The
Audit Committee has procedures in place for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services,
audit-related services, and tax services. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committee’s approval of the scope
of the engagement of the independent auditor or on an individual, explicit, case-by-case basis before the independent auditor is engaged
to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Audit Committee’s members, but the
decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

REPORT

To

Intelligent
Bio Solutions, Inc.
Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intelligent Bio Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) as of June 30,
2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
Substantial
Doubt About the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been through funding from financing
activities. The Company has reported operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. These factors raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Business
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. and its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc., were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws
of the state of Delaware. The Company’s Australian subsidiary, Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd, was formed on August 4,
2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia and was renamed to Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd on January 6, 2023. On
October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited (“IFP”), a company registered in England and Wales. The Company’s headquarters are in New York, New York.
Unless context requires or indicates otherwise, the
terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company,” or “INBS” refer to Intelligent Bio Solutions
Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing and
screening solutions. The Company operates globally with the objective of providing innovative and accessible solutions that improve the
quality of life.
NOTE
2. LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN
Through June 30, 2025, Company has financed its operations primarily
though proceeds from public offerings and private placements of equity securities, existing trade and shareholder financing arrangements,
and the incurrence of debt. The Company incurred net losses of $10,568,733 and
$10,156,759 (after losses attributable to non-controlling interest) for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of
June 30, 2025, the Company has shareholders’ equity of $2,813,824,
working capital deficit of $1,212,419,
and an accumulated deficit of $62,533,065.
The Company anticipates operating losses for the
foreseeable future. The Company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and may continue to incur operating
losses until it sufficiently delivers on its objectives which include completion of the regulatory approval process in the United States
of America (USA) and other markets where such approval may be required, expansion of its revenue base into target markets, and the continued
development of its products. The ability to achieve these objectives is subject to inherent risks and no assurance can be provided that
these objectives will be fully achieved within the next 12 months.
The
Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise a substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as going concern within one year after the date of release of these consolidated financial statements.
Management believes there is a material risk that the Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, of approximately
$1.02 million, will be insufficient to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company will be required to raise additional funds during the
next 12 months. However, there can be no assurance that when the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available
on terms which are favorable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital
needs in the future, it will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations. In
addition, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Accordingly,
these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern unless it can successfully meet
the stated objectives and/or raise additional capital.
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”)
and the rules and regulations of the “SEC”.
The consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto give retrospective effect to the stock splits for all periods presented.
Principles
of consolidation
These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries in which the
Company has a controlling voting interest and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company has a controlling financial
interest and is the primary beneficiary. Investments in entities where the Company does not exert a controlling financial interest are
not consolidated.
All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use
of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management continually evaluates the estimates and judgments it uses. These estimates
and judgments have been applied in a manner consistent with prior periods and there are no known trends, commitments, events or uncertainties
that management believes will materially affect the methodology or assumptions utilized in making these estimates and judgments in these
consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
including the useful lives and impairments of long-lived assets, realizability of inventory, the allocation of transaction price among
various performance obligations, fair value of warrants, realization of deferred tax assets and related uncertain tax positions, valuation
of stock-based compensation awards and the allowance for credit losses. Actual results could materially differ from these judgments and
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Segment
Reporting
ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC
280”), defines operating segments as components of an enterprise where discrete financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer performs the function that allocates resources and assesses performance, and thus serves as
the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews the assets, operating results, and financial metrics for four geographic segments:
●Americas
consists of North America and South America
●United
Kingdom consists of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales
●Asia
Pacific (“APAC”) consists of South East Asia and Oceania
●Rest
of the World consists of all other countries
The
CODM decides how to allocate resources based on a review of financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated
information about revenue by product types, other income and long-lived assets for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating
financial performance for each geographic region. Accordingly, management has determined that there are four reportable segments.
Accounts
Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to
customers. The allowance for credit losses is an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries in accounts receivable
using the incurred loss methodology. After considering current economic conditions and financial stability of its customers, an allowance
for credit losses is maintained at a level which management believes is sufficient to cover all probable future credit losses as of the
balance sheet date based on specific reserves and an expectation of future economic conditions that might impact collectability. Accounts
receivable are carried net of allowances for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. Account balances are charged off against the
allowance when all reasonable attempts to collect have failed. Actual write-offs may be in excess of the Company’s estimated allowance.
The allowance for credit losses was $546 and $6,772 as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
F-8
Cash
and cash equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying values of cash
and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there
were no cash equivalents.
Concentration
of credit risk
The
Company places its cash and cash equivalents, which may at times be in excess of the Australia Financial Claims Scheme, Financial Services
Compensation Scheme or the United States’ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits, with high credit quality financial
institutions and attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The amounts over these insured limits as of
June 30, 2025 and 2024 were $541,074 and $5,781,130, respectively. No losses have been incurred to date on any deposits.
Major Customer - One customer
accounted for 8.9%
and 11.5%
of revenues for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Major Supplier - The Company’s
largest suppliers accounted for 19.4%
and 30.7%
of purchases for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company relies on various suppliers for its operations.
For the purpose of supplier concentration analysis, “purchases” include only invoiced costs directly attributable to
direct material costs.
Fair
value measurements
The
accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major
asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.
Level
3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.
Assets and liabilities fair value measurement level
within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation
techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are
based on one or more of the following techniques:
Market approach: Prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
Cost approach: Amount that would
be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).
Income approach: Techniques to convert
future amounts to a single present value amount based upon market expectations (including present value techniques, option pricing, and
excess earnings models).
The Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate
and consistent with other market participants, however the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, prepaid
and other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term
nature of those instruments.
Inventories,
net
Inventory cost is determined using the
weighted-average method and valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
other costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Company periodically reviews
its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged.
The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value.
Equity
offering costs
The
Company complies with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 340, Other Assets and Deferred
Costs, with regards to offering costs. Prior to the completion of an offering of its equity securities, offering costs are capitalized as deferred
offering costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred offering costs will be charged to shareholders’ equity upon
the completion of the related offering.
F-9
Property
and Equipment, net
In accordance with the ASC 360, Property, Plant,
and Equipment, the Company’s property, plant and equipment (“PPE”), is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses, if any. Additions and significant improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Expenditures that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Costs incurred to acquire, construct, or install
PPE, before the assets are ready for use, are capitalized as construction in progress (“CIP”). The carrying amount of assets
purchased or constructed using the grant funds are presented net of grant proceeds. CIP is not depreciated until such a time when the
asset is substantially completed and ready for its intended use. Expenditure on maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the
period in which the expense is incurred. Construction in progress represents costs attributed to the construction of a manufacturing facility
in Australia.
The Company capitalizes direct costs of materials
and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software. The Company also capitalizes payroll and related costs for employees
who are directly associated with the development of software products for internal use, to the extent of the time spent directly on the
development of software. Capitalization of costs begins during the application development stage and ends when the software is available
for general use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are
expensed as incurred.
Property and equipment carrying values are reviewed
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the asset group to which the property and equipment belong might be impaired.
Depreciation
is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms:
●
Other
equipment – 3 years
●
Software
– 5 years
●
Production
equipment – 2-4 years
●
Leasehold
improvements – shorter of asset’s estimated useful life and the remaining term of the lease
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of,
the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements
of operations in the period realized.
Leases
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Lease arrangements are comprised primarily of real estate for which
the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are presented separately on the consolidated balance
sheet.
ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated
present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain
that the option will be exercised. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components
as a single lease component. Therefore, minimum lease payments used to measure the lease liability include all of the fixed consideration
in the contract.
The
Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments considering the term of the
lease, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, considering publicly available data for instruments
with similar characteristics.
Leases with an initial term
of 12 months or less are considered short-term leases and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes
lease expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease
payments, which is generally within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).
Intangible
assets
Intangible
assets are considered long-lived assets and are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The definite-lived
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed any contractual periods.
Certain of our intangible
assets have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these trade names and trademarks will contribute cash flows
to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether
the indefinite useful life is appropriate. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible
assets acquired from a foreign operation are translated from the foreign entity’s functional currency to the presentational currency
based on the exchange rate at the reporting date.
Long-lived assets
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets
and intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to
their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of impairment is calculated
as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
Assets held for sale
Long-lived assets (including disposal groups)
are classified as “Assets held for sale” when all of the applicable criteria are met in accordance with ASC 360-10-45-9:
·Management commits to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group,
·The disposal group is available to sell in its present condition,
·There is an active program to locate a buyer,
·The disposal group is being actively marketed at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value,
·Significant changes to the plan to sell are unlikely, and
·The sale of the disposal group is generally probable of being completed within one year.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are presented
separately within the consolidated balance sheets with any adjustments necessary to measure the disposal group at the lower of its carrying
value or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation of property and equipment is not recorded while these assets are classified as assets
held for sale. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as
held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the
carrying value of the disposal group recorded in other expense, net in consolidated statements of operations. We measured assets held
for sale at fair value based on level 1 inputs. See note 7—Assets held for sale for further information.
In June 2025, the Company determined that assets purchased for a manufacturing
facility that was under development would not be used in the facility and there was no alternative use thus management commenced the sale
of the equipment, which met the criteria to be held for sale. The assets were reclassified as assets held for sale in our consolidated
balance sheets as of June 30, 2025. As a result, we evaluated the assets to ensure they were recorded at the lower of their carrying value
or fair value less costs to sell. The quantitative impairment test included a comparison of estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell
to the carrying value of the assets. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a loss of $220,062, which is reflected as an impairment
loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended June 30, 2025.

Revenue
recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligations as evidenced by transfer of control of
promised goods to customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the
benefits from the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer
acceptance. Control generally transfers to the customer upon shipment to, or upon receipt by, the customer depending on the terms of sale
with the customer. In certain arrangements the Company receives payment before the customer receives the promised good. These payments
are initially recorded as deferred revenue, a contract liability, and will be recognized as revenue in the period when control is transferred
to the customer.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not have any contracts assets
or contract liabilities.

a)
Grant income
On
June 30, 2021, the Company executed a definitive grant agreement with the Australian Government to assist with building a manufacturing
facility. The grant had a total value of up to $4.7 million upon the achievement of certain milestones until March 28, 2024 (extended
to March 28, 2025 on April 16, 2024). Proceeds from the grant were used primarily to reimburse the Company for costs incurred in the
construction of the manufacturing facility.
Accounting
for the grant does not fall under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as the Australian Government will not benefit
directly from our manufacturing facility. As there is no authoritative guidance under US GAAP on accounting for grants to for-profit
business entities, we applied International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure
of Government Assistance, by analogy when accounting for the Australian Government grant to the Company. Furthermore, disclosures
made below are in accordance with the disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10, Government
Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.
F-11
The
Australian Government grant proceeds, which will be used to reimburse construction costs incurred, meet the definition of grants
related to assets as the primary purpose for the payments is to fund the construction of a capital asset. Pursuant to IAS 20, the
Company elected to record the grants received initially as deferred income and deduct the grant proceeds received from the gross
costs of the assets or construction in progress (“CIP”) and the deferred grant income liability.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, upon the end of the project deadline
for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Australia, a grant acquittal audit was completed by an independent auditor in relation
to the grant received from the Australian Government. As a result of the grant acquittal audit, the Company determined the amount owed
to the Australian Government was $2,172,108 as of June 30,2025, which is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in “Accounts
payable and accrued expenses”. The Company decided to dispose of the corresponding CIP assets as they had no alternative use to
the Company (also refer to Note 7, Assets held for sale). The CIP assets were reclassified to “Assets held for sale” on the
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025. A total of $0 and $543,410 was recognized as CIP asset on the consolidated balance sheets as of June
30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Under
IAS 20, government grants are initially recognized when there is reasonable assurance the conditions of the grant will be met and the
grant will be received. As of June 30, 2021, management concluded that there was reasonable assurance the grant conditions will be met
and all milestone payments received. The total grant value of $4.7
million was recognized as both a grant receivable and deferred
grant income on the grant effective date. The project was delayed due to global shortages of semiconductors that are used in manufacturing
equipment and global supply chain disruption due to the coronavirus pandemic in the preceding year. The Company had only completed 4
of the 8 milestones in the grant agreement as of June 30, 2024. On April 16, 2024, the Company had entered into a Deed of Variation with
Australian Government, Department of Industry, Science and Resources, extending the project completion date to March 28, 2025. The deed
of variation also made certain modifications to the project costs. The overall budget of the project was reduced by $1.65
million to account for the changes in scope of the project.
After
initial recognition, under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis in a manner that mirrors the manner
in which the Company recognizes the underlying costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Pursuant to IAS 20, the Company has
elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income for operating expenditures. Similarly, for capital expenditures,
the carrying amount of assets purchased or constructed out of the grant funds are presented net by deducting the grant proceeds received
from the gross costs of the assets or CIP and deferred grant income liability. There was $271,780
and $0 was recognized as deferred grant income during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
b)
R&D tax refund
The
Company incurs R&D expenditures in Australia and the United Kingdom that offers tax credits of 43.5% and 14.5% respectively, which
are fully refundable. The Company measures the R&D tax refund by considering the time spent by employees on eligible R&D activities
and R&D costs incurred to external service providers. A total of $545,121
and $424,776
of R&D tax refund income was recognized in other income during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The R&D tax refund receivable is recognized when there is a reasonable
assurance that the amount will be recovered in full through future claims. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the R&D tax incentive receivable was $734,408 and $525,332,
respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
(SG&A)
Selling, general and administrative expenses represent
indirect operating costs incurred in connection with product sales and corporate administration. SG&A costs include:
·Salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and severance for administrative
and sales support staff
·Marketing, advertising, promotional expenses
·Investor relationship (IR) costs
·Occupancy costs
·Professional services related to legal, audit and other services
·Insurance costs
·Travel, utilities and other general expenses
SG&A does not include costs related to manufacturing
or R&D. Costs that are directly attributable to production are classified as cost of revenue, while expenses related to product development
are recorded as development and regulatory approval expenses.
Development
and regulatory approval costs
Development
and regulatory approval costs include external expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties; salaries and personnel-related
costs; license fees to acquire in-process technology; R&D related costs; intellectual property acquired for a particular research
and development project and that have no alternative future uses (in other research and development projects or otherwise) and other
expenses. The Company recognizes the benefit of refundable R&D tax refunds as a R&D tax refund income when there is reasonable
assurance that the amount claimed will be recovered though the future claims.
Warrants
The Company evaluates the appropriate balance
sheet classification of warrants that are issued as either equity or as a derivative liability. The Company classifies a warrant as equity
if it is “indexed to the Company’s equity” and meets several specific conditions for equity classification. A warrant
is not considered “indexed to the Company’s equity,” in general, when it contains certain types of exercise contingencies
or potential adjustments to its exercise price. If a warrant is not indexed to the Company’s equity or it has net cash settlement
provisions that result in the warrants being accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC
480”) or ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), it is classified as a derivative liability and carried
on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with any changes in its fair value recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss). At June 30, 2025 and 2024, all of the Company’s outstanding warrants were classified as equity.
Equity-Based
Compensation
Equity-based compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, if any, based on the terms of the awards. The fair value of the stock-based payments to employees and non-employees that are fully
vested and non-forfeitable at the grant date is measured at their grant date fair value, unless there is a contractual term for services
in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.
Employee
benefits
The
costs of short-term employee benefits are recognized as a liability and an expense unless those costs are required to be recognized as
part of the cost of inventories or non-current assets. The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognized in the period in which
the employee’s services are received. Termination benefits are recognized immediately as an expense when the Company is demonstrably
committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
The Company has recognized
the obligation for unpaid salaries, director fees, holiday leaves, retirement benefits and long service leave entitlements as employee
benefits. Employee benefit obligations are classified as either current or non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets based on the timing of expected settlement.
F-12
Advertising
expenses
Advertising
expenses are expensed as they are incurred. For the years ended June 30, 2025, and 2024, $1,554,773
and $725,422
of advertising expenses, respectively, were incurred and classified
within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss).
Foreign
currency
The
Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar (“USD”). The functional currency for each foreign subsidiary included
in these consolidated financial statements is the applicable local currency of each entity.
For each entity whose functional currency is not
the USD, assets and liabilities are translated into USD using the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses
are translated into USD using the average rate in effect for year. Translation gains and losses are recorded as a foreign currency translation
adjustment as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Cash
flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods; therefore, amounts reported on the consolidated statements of
cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains
and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are
included in the results of operations as incurred.
Comprehensive
income (loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) includes net
loss as well as other changes in shareholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with shareholders.
For the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, these changes related to foreign currency translation gains and losses. There were no reclassifications
out of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.
Income
taxes
The
Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of preparing the consolidated
financial statements. This involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences, together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits,
are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates, for the appropriate tax jurisdiction, which are expected to be in effect when these
differences are anticipated to reverse.
A
judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance
may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the event the Company determines
that it may not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future or that new estimates indicate that a previously
recorded valuation allowance is no longer required, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to income in the period
of such determination.
The Company recognizes tax positions that meet
a “more likely than not” (greater than 50 percent likelihood) minimum recognition threshold. If necessary, the Company recognizes
interest and penalties associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision when incurred and would include accrued interest
and penalties with the related tax liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no uncertain tax positions or related
interest or penalties requiring accrual at June 30, 2025 and 2024.
Net
loss per share
The
Company calculates earnings per share attributable to common shareholders in accordance with ASC 260, Earning Per Share. Basic
net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net
loss attributable to common shareholders by weighted average common stock outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common
stock, such as share warrants.
Potentially
dilutive common stock are calculated in accordance with the treasury share method, which assumes that proceeds from the exercise of all
warrants are used to repurchase common stock at market value. The number of shares remaining after the proceeds are exhausted represents
the potentially dilutive effect of the securities.
As
the Company has incurred net losses in all periods, certain potentially dilutive securities, including convertible preferred stock, warrants
to acquire common stock, and convertible notes payable have been excluded in the computation of diluted loss per share as the effects
are antidilutive.
The
following outstanding warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because their
effect would have been anti-dilutive:

have been reclassified to conform to current period presentations. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, loss per share,
cash flows, assets, liabilities, or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.
Recent
accounting pronouncements
As
the Company is an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.
Adopted:
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) – Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU -08 requires that an acquirer recognizes, and measure
contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, as if it had originated the
contracts. Prior to this ASU, an acquirer generally recognized contract assets acquired, and contract liabilities assumed that arose
from contracts with customers at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective
date of the amendment. The Company has adopted ASU 2021-08. Adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not impact our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2023-07, Segment
Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses
that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and included within each reported measure of segment profit
or loss. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,
on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective June 30, 2025, for the annual period
beginning July 1, 2024. While the adoption has no impact on our consolidated financial statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures
within the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 4, Segment Reporting for the inclusion of
the new required disclosures.
Pending
adoption:
In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU requires
greater disaggregation of information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income
taxes paid. The ASU applies to all entities subject to income taxes and is intended to help investors better understand an entity’s
exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts and
capital allocation decisions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
The ASU should be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
of this standard on our disclosures.
On
November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
(Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which is intended to enhance transparency of the nature and function
of expenses, primarily through additional disclosures of certain cost and expenses. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for our annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with
early adoption permitted, and is required to be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. We expect the adoption
of this ASU will have no impact on our financial position or our results of operations but will result in additional disclosures.
F-13
NOTE
4. SEGMENT REPORTING
ASC
280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for the manner in which companies report financial information about operating segments,
products, services, geographic areas and major customers.
Our
Segments
During the year ended June 30, 2025,
the revised our reportable segments to a region-focused structure, aligning with changes in our business and organizational
structure. This transition was driven by several key developments, including the end of project for the construction of a
manufacturing facility in Australia during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2025 and the reversion of intellectual property
rights to the University of Newcastle following the liquidation of LSBD, the former licensor. These events prompted a reassessment
of the Company’s operating model and strategic priorities, resulting in the adoption of a region-based segment reporting
structure that better aligns with the geographic focus of the business and how management evaluates performance and allocates
resources.
The
following tables set forth the Company’s revenue, government support income, net loss and long-lived assets and inventories by
operating and reportable segments.

In June 2025,
the Company determined that assets purchased for a manufacturing facility that was under development would not be used in the facility
and the Company had no alternative use. Therefore, management committed to a plan to sell the assets (the “Disposal Group”).
The Disposal Group was reclassified to Assets Held for Sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025. Depreciation
of the Disposal Group will not be recorded while these assets are classified as held for sale. The Company performance an assessment
of the Disposal Group and determined the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. As a result,
the Company recorded an impairment loss of $220,062, which is included as impairment of long-lived assets in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended June 30, 2025.

17. INCOME TAX
The
Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under
the asset and liability method, we determine deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measure them using currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company provides a
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are more likely than not to be realized. Realization of
our net operating loss carryforward was not reasonably assured as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the Company has recorded a valuation allowance
of $12,698,469 and $10,421,568, respectively against deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities.
