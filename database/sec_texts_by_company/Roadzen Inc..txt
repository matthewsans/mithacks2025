BASIS
OF PRESENTATION
Roadzen
Inc. (“Roadzen”) (formerly known as Vahanna Tech Edge Acquisition I Corp. or “Vahanna”) was a blank check company
originally incorporated on April 22, 2021 as a British Virgin Islands business company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On November
12, 2021, the registration statement relating to an initial public offering (“IPO”) was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). On November 26, 2021, Vahanna consummated the IPO of 20,010,000 units at $10.00 per
unit and the sale of 8,638,500 warrants at a price of $1.00 per private warrant in a private placement to Vahanna LLC (the “Sponsor”)
that closed simultaneously with the closing of the IPO. The units were listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”). On
February 10, 2023, Vahanna entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Initial Merger Agreement”) with Vahanna
Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Vahanna (“Merger Sub”), and Roadzen, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Roadzen (DE)”).
On
September 20, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Roadzen (DE), Vahanna, and Merger Sub consummated the business combination pursuant
to the Initial Merger Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2023 (the “Merger
Agreement Amendment”, and the Initial Merger Agreement as amended by the Merger Agreement Amendment, the “Merger Agreement”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Roadzen (DE), with Roadzen (DE) surviving the merger as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Vahanna (the “Merger,” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and the other agreements contemplated thereby, the “Business Combination”). In connection with the consummation of the Business
Combination (the “Closing”), Vahanna changed its name to “Roadzen Inc.”
In
connection with the Closing, and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement: (i) each outstanding share of Roadzen (DE) common stock,
including common stock issued upon conversion of each outstanding share of Roadzen (DE)’s preferred stock, was cancelled and converted
into the right to receive 27.21 ordinary shares of Roadzen (the “Ordinary Shares”), (ii) each restricted stock unit of Roadzen
(DE) (“Roadzen (DE) RSU”) was assumed and converted into the right to receive 27.21 restricted stock units of Roadzen (each,
a “Roadzen RSU”) and were assumed as Substitute Awards under the Roadzen Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, (iii) each equity
security of Roadzen (DE) other than Roadzen (DE) common stock and Roadzen (DE) RSUs (each, a “Roadzen (DE) Additional Security”)
was assumed and converted into the right to receive equity interests that may vest, settle, convert or be exercised into 27.21 Ordinary
Shares, (iv) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing was cancelled, retired
and ceased to exist and (v) each ordinary share of Vahanna (each, a “Vahanna ordinary share”) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing and not redeemed in connection with the redemption remained outstanding and is now an Ordinary Share.
On
September 21, 2023, our Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and warrants to purchase the Ordinary Shares (the “Warrants”)
began trading under the symbols, “RDZN” and “RDZNW,” respectively.
The
Business Combination was accounted for as a common control transaction, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance
with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Vahanna was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes.
Under the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations
for transactions between entities under common control, the assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interests of Roadzen (DE) and Vahanna
are recognized at their carrying amounts on the date of the Business Combination. Roadzen (DE) has been determined to be the predecessor
to the combined entity. Accordingly, our financial statements reflect (i) the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior to the
Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Vahanna and Roadzen (DE) following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii)
the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.
Unless
otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company,” “Roadzen,” “we,”
“us,” or “our” refer to the business of Roadzen (DE) and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business
Combination and became the business of Roadzen Inc. and its subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination.
References
to a year refers to our fiscal year ended on March 31 of the specified year.
Certain
monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included herein have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown
as totals in certain tables and charts may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed
as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages
that precede them.

MARKET
AND INDUSTRY DATA
This
Annual Report includes estimates regarding market and industry data and forecasts, which are based on our own estimates utilizing our
management’s knowledge of and experience in, as well as information obtained from our subscribers, trade and business organizations,
and other contacts in the market sectors in which we compete, and from statistical information obtained from publicly available information,
industry publications and surveys, reports from government agencies, and reports by market research firms. We confirm that, where such
information is reproduced herein, such information has been accurately reproduced and that, so far as we are aware and are able to ascertain
from information published by publicly available sources and other publications, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced
information inaccurate or misleading. Industry publications, reports, and other published data generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but we cannot assure you that the information contained in these reports,
and therefore the information contained in this Annual Report that is derived therefrom, is accurate or complete. Our estimates of our
market position may prove to be inaccurate because of the method by which we obtain some of the data for our estimates or because this
information cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to the limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the
voluntary nature of the data gathering process, and other limitations and uncertainties. As a result, although we believe our sources
are reliable, we have not independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness.

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Annual
Report are forward-looking statements. This includes, without limitation, statements regarding our vision and business strategy, including
the plans and objectives of management for our future operations; our market opportunities, our future revenue opportunities, performance
of our partnerships, and our future performance and financial condition. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Annual Report, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expected to,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “strive,” “would,” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but
the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections,
and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks
and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual
Report, including, but not limited to:
●our
limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;
●we
may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain our competitive position and high-level
customer satisfaction if we fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources,
particularly if we continue to grow rapidly;
●a
significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers;
●our
business depends on our use of proprietary technology relying heavily on laws to protect;
●our
management team has limited experience managing a public company;
●U.S.
shareholders may not be able to obtain judgments or enforce civil liabilities against us
or our executive officers or our Board of Directors (our “Board”);
●we
will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and
our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives;
and
●other
factors detailed under the section “Summary of Risk Factors” and Part I. Item
1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
These
forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Annual Report and current expectations, forecasts,
and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks, and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied
upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise,
except as may be required under applicable securities laws. We intend the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report
to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or the “Securities Act”, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange
Act”.
As
a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from
those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
iv
SUMMARY
RISK FACTORS
Our
business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section entitled “Risk Factors”
in this Annual Report, that represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and the
growth of our business. In particular, the following considerations, among others, may offset our competitive strengths, or have a negative
effect on our business strategy, which could cause a decline in the price of shares of our Ordinary Shares or Warrants and result in
a loss of all or a portion of your investment:
●We
have a history of losses and we anticipate increased expenses in the future.
●A
substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of clients ranging
from insurers, OEMs and automotive fleets, and the loss of any of these clients, or a significant
revenue reduction from any of these clients, could materially impact our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
●Recent
U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) regulations and guidelines may continue
to have an adverse impact on our business and operations in the U.K.
●International
trade policies, including tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers may adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
●Our
larger clients have negotiating leverage, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions
that result in increased cost of sales, decreased revenue, lower average selling prices and
gross margins, and increased contractual liability risks, all of which could harm our results
of operations.
●If
we are unable to attract new customers, our future revenue and results of operations will
be harmed.
●Our
rapid growth makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and increases the risk that
we will not continue to grow at or near historical rates.
●We
may not be able to ensure the accuracy and completeness of product information and the effectiveness
of our recommendation of insurance products on our platform.
●Increases
in technology costs that are used in providing services to our clients would adversely affect
our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
●Our
business depends on our brand, and if we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand
and reputation cost-effectively, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.
●Our
revenue growth rate in part depends on existing customers renewing and upgrading their contracts.
●A
decline in our customer renewals and expansions could adversely impact our future results
of operations.
●We
rely heavily on direct sales to sell automobile insurance brokerage services.
●Our
growth strategy depends on continued investment in and around the delivery of innovative
AI solutions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering the above-mentioned AI solutions, it could
adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
●A
downturn in the automotive sector, auto insurance industry, claims volumes, or supporting
economy, which are outside of our control, could adversely impact our results of operations.
●Changes
in the automotive insurance industry, including the adoption of new technologies, such as
autonomous vehicles, may significantly impact our results of operations.
●Our
customers may defer or forego purchases of automobiles in the event of weakened global economic
conditions or political transitions, which in turn will affect purchases of our products
or services.
●We
face competition in our market, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations,
and financial condition and cause our market share to decline.
●If
we are unable to develop, introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our services
and products, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage and our operating results could
be adversely affected.
●The
federal government or independent standards organizations may implement significant regulations
or standards that could adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products.
v
●We
are and in the future may become a party to litigation, which could result in damage to our reputation
and harm our future results of operations.
●Failure
to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines
and penalties and could also cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business.
●Our
failure to comply with the requirements of applicable environmental legislation and regulation
could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
●We
are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations
related to privacy, data protection, and data security. Any actual or perceived failure to
comply with such obligations could harm our business.
●Failure

Item
1. Business.
Overview
Roadzen
Inc. is a leading Insurtech company on a mission to transform global auto insurance powered by advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”).
At the heart of our mission is our commitment to create transparency, efficiency, and a seamless experience for the millions of end customers
who use our products through our insurer, OEM, and fleet (such as trucking, delivery, and commercial fleets) partners. We seek to accomplish
this by combining computer vision, telematics and AI with continually updated data sources to provide a more efficient, effective and
informed way of building auto insurance products, assessing damages, processing claims and improving driver safety. Insurers and other
partners of Roadzen across the world use Roadzen’s technology to launch new auto insurance products, manage risk better and resolve
claims faster. These products are built with dynamic underwriting capabilities, Application Programming Interface, or API-led distribution
and real-time claims processing.
Roadzen
has built a pioneering technology platform that uses telematics, computer vision and data science to spearhead innovation across the
insurance value chain, namely underwriting, distribution, claims and road safety. We call it the Roadzen “Insurance as a Service”
(“IaaS”) platform. Our business generates commission-based revenue as an insurance broker focused on embedded and B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Customer)
insurance distribution, and fee-based revenue as a provider of innovative cloud, telematics, and AI-based applications for the auto insurance
ecosystem.
Roadzen
has four major client types:
●Insurance
— including insurance companies, reinsurers, agents, brokers;
●Automotive
— including carmakers, dealerships, online-to-offline car sales platforms;
●Fleets
— including small and medium fleets, taxi fleets, ridesharing platforms, commercial
and corporate fleets; and
●Other
distribution channels such as financial services companies providing auto loans, and telematics
companies.
Our
operations are global, serving a diverse and expanding client base that includes market-leading insurance companies, fleets, and automotive
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as AXA, SCOR, Arch, Société Générale, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi,
Mercedes, Volvo, and several others. We deliver specialized insurance and mobility solutions across key geographies, including India,
the U.S., U.K. and Europe, through a network of regulated entities and licensed platforms.
In
the U.K. and Europe, we operate through a specialist Managing General Agent (“MGA”) based in Coventry, England, which provides
auto insurance, extended warranties, and claims management services to insurers, automotive dealers, manufacturers, and fleet operators.
This MGA leverages its regulatory license to underwrite and service policies locally while utilizing third-party licenses to deliver
solutions globally. It acts as a delegated authority on behalf of insurers, managing policy sales and claims adjudication via its brokerage
platform. Revenue is generated through commissions and administrative fees tied to Gross Written Premium (“GWP”), with specialty
contracts typically structured over five-year terms.
In
the U.S., we operate a licensed auto club based in Burlingame, California that specializes in commercial roadside assistance (“RSA”)
and claims management. With a robust network of over 75,000 service providers nationwide, it offers towing, transportation and first
notice of loss (“FNOL”) services to government fleets, enterprises, insurers and auto manufacturers. These capabilities support
our comprehensive suite of mobility and insurance infrastructure services across North America.
In
India, we operate as a licensed insurance broker providing distribution and servicing of motor insurance products, while also providing
RSA, vehicle inspection, and claims management services. Our India operations also serve as the Company’s global technology headquarters,
where our product, engineering, and AI teams develop and scale the core platforms that power our insurance and mobility services worldwide.
Together, these operations form a seamless platform that combines insurance, technology, and mobility services across our global footprint.
Our
mission is to build the leading company at the intersection of AI, insurance and mobility. To further our mission, we have built a pioneering
lab focused on fundamental and applied AI research. We work on core research areas in computer vision, generative AI, and traditional
machine learning to develop product experiences that improve the safety, convenience, and protection of millions of drivers across the
world. Roadzen is a founding member of the AI Alliance fostering safe, responsible, and open-source development alongside industry leaders
such as Meta, IBM, Hugging Face, Stability AI, AMD, Service Now, and others. Our approach to building precision AI models in insurance
and mobility has won several industry accolades. In October 2021, Forbes Magazine ranked Roadzen among the Top 10 AI companies. In 2022,
Financial Express named Roadzen AI Startup of the Year. Additionally, the company won two awards at the prestigious Global Artificial
Intelligence Summit & Awards: “Best Use of AI in Mobility” and “Best Use of AI in Insurance,” both presented
by the All India Council for Robotics & Automation (AICRA). Roadzen achieved significant industry recognition for its advancements
in AI and technology during Fiscal Year 2025. Honors included ‘Best AI in Deep Tech’ at the AI Awards Summit 2025 by Entrepreneur
India and secured a spot on the Fintech40 Index by L’Observatoire de la Fintech. It was named the ‘World’s Top InsurTech’
by CNBC in 2024, ‘Most Innovative Use of AI’ by Financial Express at the FE Futech Awards 2024 and won the Gold Stevie Award
for its xClaim insurance solution at the International Business Awards 2024. Additional recognitions included ‘Excellence in InsurTech’
by the India FinTech Forum (IFTA 2024), ‘Best Use of AI in Insurance’ at the Global AI Summit & Awards (GAISA 2024),
and ‘Best Product and Business Team’ at the World Auto Forum 2024. Roadzen also won ‘Best Use of Technology’
at the Entrepreneur Awards 2024 and ‘Most Innovative Company’ at the World Finance Innovation Awards 2024.
1
Our
Opportunity
We
recognize four broad areas of opportunity for the future of auto insurance that our technology is poised to address.
Product
and Pricing
The
way auto insurance is underwritten and priced is expected to undergo a fundamental shift. With increasing connectivity, “pay how
you drive” and usage-based insurance (“UBI”) will emerge as natural complements to traditional auto insurance. Mobile
apps, aftermarket devices, and the actuarial challenges of underwriting insights after selection are likely to become outdated. Instead,
the insurance industry is likely to experience a change due to a proliferation of connected data from the vehicle which, when added to
demographic data and loss-causing information such as braking, acceleration, cornering and driving speed, will create better risk pools.
Such enhanced and connected data will improve the accuracy and convenience of assessing and pricing risk in real-time, giving advantage
to those that have access to this data.
Similarly,
within products such as extended warranty it has now become easier to gather data about a vehicle’s performance and usage, including
information about how the vehicle is being driven, its maintenance history, and potential mechanical issues. This information can be
used to identify potential problems early on, before they become major issues that require costly repairs. As our technology advances,
it is likely that extended warranties will become more customized and data-driven. For example, instead of offering a blanket coverage
plan, extended warranties may be tailored to individual drivers based on their driving habits and usage patterns.
Claims
Today’s
claims processes are fragmented, complex and manual. Processing claims requires significant input from customers, insurers, repair-shop
networks and rental providers, and it often relies on incomplete data from the parties involved.
In
the new future of mobility, insurers will be able to simplify, streamline and automate the claims process through telematics and video
streaming to provide accurate data on a real time basis. AI will interpret the data gathered, allowing for seamless claims handling and
enabling the insurer to choose how and when to introduce human intervention. Small claims can be automated to be fully touchless and
processed within minutes from first notification of loss, or FNOL, to payments.
The
vehicle repair and rental segments could also undergo their own shift (opening opportunities for OEMs) because traditional repair shops
do not have much experience with repairing vehicles with highly sophisticated embedded technology.
Distribution
As
the number of connected vehicles grows, so too will in-vehicle services and products, including insurance. OEMs have historically participated
in insurance distribution by acting as a lead-referral partner to a range of insurance providers. However, the growth of both connected
vehicles and digital direct-to-consumer distribution of electric vehicles provides promising prospects for a new channel through which
consumers can directly buy insurance from the OEM in an embedded purchase. The OEMs will require partners who can provide a white-labeled
technology platform through which the OEMs can price policies, process claims and offer other products such as extended warranty coverage.
2
Auto
Insurance Market
Insurance
is a $5.5 trillion industry that accounts for approximately 7% of global gross domestic product (“GDP”). Advances in smartphone
penetration, data ubiquity, and AI have created a significant opportunity to shape the digital insurance economy.
The
automotive insurance market is an industry led by legacy players. The global automotive insurance market was approximately $630 billion
in 2021 and is projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2030. There are approximately 1.4 billion vehicles on the road, including cars, vans
and trucks (excluding motorcycles). The premiums paid for automobile insurance was close to 15% of the total insurance premiums paid
worldwide in 2022. Over the span of the next ten years, auto insurance premiums are likely to surpass 20% of total insurance premiums,
representing high traction for the segment.
The
continued development of autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, connected vehicles (vehicles that can communicate bidirectionally with
other systems outside of the car) and Mobility as a Service (“MaaS”) platforms can shift the emphasis from providing individual
insurance to providing insurance to fleet owners, and embedded insurance at the point-of-sale to car companies. This changing trend signals
a shift from direct insurance (which is insurance sold ad-hoc to a consumer and separate from the purchase of the vehicle) to embedded
insurance solutions (which is a form of digital bundling that enables companies to offer insurance policies as an add-on) with enhanced
focus on road safety, accident prevention, usage-based insurance, warranties, and distribution platforms with technologies to provide
ongoing support capabilities on policies.
Roadzen
is uniquely positioned with the technology, global scale, and strategic relationships to emerge as a key player at the forefront of this
massive change.
Our
Business
Roadzen
has two principal models for generating revenue: 1) platform sales of our IaaS platform, and 2) brokerage commissions and fees. We follow
a capital-light business model, meaning that we do not underwrite any risk ourselves or carry any insurance risk on our balance sheet
for either source of revenue.
1.IaaS
Platform:
Roadzen
provides an IaaS technology platform addressed towards insurance for mobility. The IaaS platform has a suite of products that work cohesively
to address the auto insurance value chain. Roadzen sells its IaaS platform to insurers, car manufacturers, and fleet companies to deliver
services for their respective insured customers. Our deep understanding of the insurance industry has enabled us to develop a unified
suite of modules and products that is tailored to address the key challenges faced in auto insurance. Our proprietary solution suite
includes several products that support the insurance lifecycle, such as:
●Via:
enables fleets, carmakers and insurers to inspect a vehicle using computer vision;
●Global
Distribution Network (GDN): enables the configuration, customer quote, payment (in any
currency), and administration of any insurance policy with any insurance carrier as the underwriter:
●xClaim:
enables digital, touchless and real-time resolution of claims from FNOL through payment,
using telematics and computer vision;
●StrandD:
enables digital, real-time dispatch and tracking for RSA and FNOL during accident claims;
●Good
Driving: enables insurers and fleets to recognize their best drivers, train poor drivers
and build usage-based insurance, or UBI programs; and
●DrivebuddyAI:
enables any vehicle to get advanced driver-assistance capabilities utilizing cameras
and neural networks to deliver better safety on the road.
●MixtapeAI:
a platform designed to power AI agents and transform customer interactions in the insurance
and mobility sectors.
Our
technology revolutionizes the customer experience by helping customers obtain a policy within seconds and process a claim estimate within
minutes in comparison with existing processes that can take weeks. Roadzen’s revenue derived from platform sales is usage-based,
meaning we get paid on a per-vehicle or per-use basis.
3
Roadzen’s IaaS income accounted for approximately 47% of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025.
2.Brokerage Solutions:
Roadzen
acts as an insurance broker utilizing its technology to sell insurance through our embedded and B2B2C distribution model. The policies
are sold by insurance intermediaries such as agents and through captive distributors such as dealerships, fleets and used car platforms.
Our B2B2C channel partners choose us for a variety of reasons — for the ease of integrating our technology through APIs into their
ecosystem, for a seamless, fully digital customer experience from obtaining a policy to submitting a claim, and for integrations with
a large number of insurance companies who sell their policies through our platform to give users multiple policy options. Lastly, we
can provide a superior customer experience by bundling telematics for road safety, roadside assistance (“RSA”) and claims
management to the customer — a customer experience that we believe is unrivaled by other traditional brokers. Roadzen’s revenues
from brokerage services are based on commissions and other fees that are paid by our insurance carriers as a percentage of the Gross
Written Premium for each policy.
Roadzen’s
brokerage solutions accounted for approximately 53% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Our
Strengths
1.Data.
We have collected extensive data and consumer insights over the years. These data insights
help our insurer customers with more accurate risk assessment and pricing of their policies.
By providing insurers with tailored data insights and analytics to make profitable risk selections,
we enable them to generate advanced pricing simulation and underwriting models.
2.Technology
Architecture. Our open API architecture is conducive to technology integrations with
insurers on one side and distribution channels on the other for our brokerage business. Our
platform enables real-time data sharing and pricing simulations. We continuously automate
the processes across policy purchase and issuance, servicing and renewals, thereby streamlining
processes for insurers who utilize our platform to offer insurance to their customers. We
also work with insurers to create dedicated and customized technology-based solutions for
various process flows, such as offering computer vision-based inspections, digital KYC and
easy payment processing.
3.Deep
domain expertise. We have assembled a global team with decades of experience and knowledge
in insurance, automotive and technology. This cross-functional expertise is necessary to
address the complexity in the automotive insurance sector.
4.Proven
R&D engine. We invest heavily in R&D efforts and are committed to delivering
market-leading technology for the auto insurance economy. We believe AI will have a transformative
impact on the insurance economy and have focused our efforts on deep learning technology,
and we have released several new solutions incorporating real world AI at enterprise scale.
We are building a high-tech computer vision lab where our goal is to make machines “see.”
This has a significant impact at the intersection of insurance and mobility. We have developed
over 150 AI models in computer vision as well as natural language processing such as car
inspection, driver scoring, vehicle, part and damage detection, driver distraction, insurance
GPT (policy summary of any insurance policy), claims invoice automation, road object detection
and driver facial landmark detection. Roadzen AI is built on our proprietary Canvas platform
that allows ground truth generation, automated model selection, and continuous training and
deployment of AI models. We believe our focus on machine learning operations allows us to
build and deploy models faster, iterate quicker and produce impactful real-world AI is a
significant competitive advantage over our traditional and Insurtech peers.
5.Deep,
collaborative ecosystem relationships. Since founding, we have developed strong and strategic
relationships with leading insurers, reinsurers, on-ground repair networks, dealership groups,
fleets and automotive manufacturers, among others. We are a trusted partner to our clients,
which allows us to collaborate and adapt our business based on customer feedback and changing
expectations to stay ahead of our competition.
Our
Business Strategy
1.Acquire
New Customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer
base across the auto insurance industry. We have 112 major customers in the insurance and
automotive industry and approximately 3,800 customers made up of smaller agents and fleets,
which represents a very small portion of carriers, automakers and fleets  globally.
We are investing in our sales and marketing, specifically targeting key accounts, expanding
small business sales, and leveraging current customers as references.
4
2.Cross-sell
and Upsell to Existing Customers. A central part of our strategy is expanding solution
adoption across our existing customer base. We have developed long-term relationships with
our customers and have a proven track record of successfully cross-selling product offerings.
Our customers are increasingly looking to Roadzen as a trusted partner to address complexity
and solve their challenges. We have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling
additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full solution suite
from our platform. As we innovate and bring new technology and solutions to the market, we also
have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling new products to our existing
customer base. Our customers include leading insurers and car companies that have a global
presence and are keen on digitizing their auto insurance offerings. We believe that successful
integration in one geography can open up opportunities within other geographies.
3.Broaden
our partner ecosystem. We view our customers as partners, as our product offerings act
as an extension of their business. We intend to extend our network of partners to enhance
our value proposition and create new market opportunities. We have a large network of insurance
providers and reinsurance providers that use our platform and that are either interdependent
on each other or, at the very least, would benefit from fostering mutually beneficial relationships
with one another. As an example, if a reinsurer is looking to expand into a new market, they
will need an insurer that can support them on the front end of the insurance process. Roadzen’s
network of insurers is a great resource and Roadzen can help facilitate a marriage of reinsurer
with insurer, providing a potential business expansion solution for its customers and, in
turn, creating more business conducted through Roadzen. The more customers Roadzen acquires,
the likelier it becomes that one customer will find a partner in another customer.
4.Broaden
our geographical presence. We believe there is significant need for our solutions on
a global basis and, accordingly, an opportunity to grow our business through international
expansion. The global nature of several of our clients provides an excellent anchor relationship
to launch us into new markets.
Our
Offerings
Our
main offerings are underwriting solutions for cars, drivers and fleets, road safety using app-based and computer vision-based telematics
(including accident prevention, distraction alerts, and driver coaching), and claims management (including accident scene management,
FNOL, touchless video loss adjustment and RSA).
Roadzen
markets these solutions through one of two channels — (i) as an IaaS provider or (ii) as a broker. Roadzen builds and tests its
solutions in high-frequency and low margin Indian auto-insurance markets before deploying the services to higher-margin markets in the
U.K, E.U., and U.S.
1.Insurance
as a Service (IaaS) Platform
Roadzen’s
unified IaaS platform powered by computer vision and telematics helps insurers improve their underwriting capabilities, and process real-time
claims using touchless, remote protocols. Using our technology, our clients can launch products quickly and provide a great end-customer
experience to motorists. Supported by a vertically integrated AI stack with labeling, training, and neural network design capabilities,
Roadzen gives insurers personalized underwriting capabilities, and instant claims processing abilities. Our IaaS platform-enabled products
include underwriting and claims processing, which are managed on a fully-integrated, real-time platform.
Underwriting
Roadzen’s
underwriting platform, powered by AI-trained models, helps customers make better, data-driven decisions, which results in accurate and
precise policy underwriting. We provide a pricing engine that allows the underwriting of insurance policies based on asset value, usage-based
insurance, driver scoring using telematics, and other auto products such as extended warranty. Our rating engine empowers insurers to
underwrite risk using in-house data sources, delivering dynamic risk-assessed pricing for each policy insured. As more data accumulates,
recursive patterns emerge, creating precise assessment of risk. Our offerings are extremely valuable to our customers, as most traditional
insurers typically lack the expertise to build AI-powered underwriting technologies in-house. Additionally, our technology requires a
large amount of data to create and train predictive models with accuracy. Roadzen, through its partnerships with insurers, has continuous
access to large volumes of data. As Roadzen’s technology is built in-house and not influenced by any specific customer, the underwriting
algorithms are unbiased and allow Roadzen to serve as an industry benchmark. Roadzen offers underwriting platforms for asset-based underwriting
and usage-based underwriting and is working towards providing underwriting platforms for behavior-based underwriting.
5
Claims
Processing
For
insurers, it is challenging to manage the customer experience during the claims process. Furthermore, Insurtech innovations over the
last two decades have been highly focused on distribution, with less of an emphasis on seamless, efficient claims processing for the
end customer. Roadzen has built an ecosystem that helps insurers provide an improved customer experience.
Roadzen’s
claims platform is powered by telematics, computer vision algorithms, and real-time video streaming modules to conduct live surveys of
vehicle accidents. Within seconds, AI and computer-vision algorithms can identify the damaged parts, the extent of the damage, repair
or replacement decisions, and the estimated cost of repair. Traditionally, this multi-step process takes anywhere between two (2) and
seven (7) days, depending on the insurer. Additionally, total costs can be inflated by the interplay among multiple service providers
that have traditionally been involved in repairing a damaged vehicle (such as repairers, surveyors and others). As Roadzen’s technology
is unbiased, Roadzen eliminates the threat of cost inflation, providing savings to both the insurance company and its end customer. Roadzen’s
digital claims management platform, xClaim, is built for a user-driven approach and has transformed opaque claims processing into proactive
engagement with customers.
xClaim
initiates a claim using telematics, conducts remote surveys of accidents using photos and videos, and processes the claim by providing
an estimate of costs needed to repair or replace the damaged part purely using computer vision. Applying photography, video-streaming
and computer vision, Roadzen can inspect a vehicle instantly to assess risk profile, damages, and repair value. We believe that Roadzen
delivers a best-in-class customer experience with improved outcomes for insurers, customers and repair shops alike. Whether parametric,
assisted, or self-service, our engine handles all claims using algorithmic triage protocols, video, and deep learning for faster and
more accurate resolution. Our deep ecosystem for claims processing includes loss adjusters, repairers, roadside assistance, and payments
for a one-stop solution to simplify and transform the claims journey.
Roadside
Assistance (“RSA”)
We
believe RSA is key to offering a better claims experience for customers, including our fleet and OEM customers, and a powerful tool to
limit fraud and leakage for insurers. End customers who sustain an accident need proactive service by insurers to start the claim and
FNOL processes. Roadzen’s assistance platform can capture the “moment of truth” for insurers by obtaining near real-time
information about the accident with video and photographic evidence. In a matter of minutes, Roadzen’s solution provides the insurer
with clarity on all relevant questions after an incident occurs, including details on the parties involved, extent of the damage, and
the time, location, and stated cause of the incident. Roadzen’s white-labelled RSA product, StrandD, provides accident management,
emergency call, vehicle-breakdown call, network management, and digital dispatch capabilities to get customers back on the road quickly.
As a digitally enabled and integrated network, StrandD provides for 24/7 customer service. Roadzen is working with industry-leading
automotive companies, insurers, aggregators, and fleets to power their assistance needs.
Telematics
We
have built a telematics data exchange that enables the ingestion of mobility data from a multitude of sources, including connected cars,
on-board diagnostics devices, software development kits (mobile apps), and dashcam video. It is a next-generation telematics platform
that adds real-time driving context to significantly improve risk measurement, and more importantly, guide drivers to avoid predictable
risks and make driving safer. Roadzen’s telematics improves upon first-generation telematics solutions by fusing real-time traffic,
video context, and weather information with driver behavior data. Additionally, we add driver distractions and fatigue to the evaluation
matrix, and we measure accident hot spots to create the most comprehensive and rich driving evaluation possible. Roadzen’s telematics
offerings are bundled into its underwriting, claims and brokerage products.
Our
platform generates a driver score for each driver and a fleet safety index to help insurers make more informed underwriting decisions
and offer better products to their customers. Fleet owners can better track driving behavior and provide this feedback to their drivers,
all leading to improved and safer fleet operations. The potential benefits of this approach include safer drivers, fewer accidents, fewer
delays and shorter repair times, leading to greater efficiency, lower costs, and greater profits. Roadzen has three telematics layers
operating on the same core technology.
Roadzen
telematics for insurance consists of a comprehensive telematics stack for driver behavior including:
●Software-based:
The insured end customer’s mobile phone generates driving behavior data through a software
development kit (“SDK”) which is integrated into a mobile application. This software
is primarily utilized by insurers to embed in the end customer applications, generating the
insured’s driver score for future policy underwriting.
●Connected
vehicles: As vehicles become increasingly connected over time, more and more will have
a telematics control unit built into the vehicle, and Roadzen’s APIs can integrate
with the vehicle software to fetch data for our exchange.
6
●Video
telematics: Roadzen’s subsidiary DrivebuddyAI is a V2X (“vehicle-to-everything”)
dashcam that brings ADAMATICS (ADAS + Telematics) capabilities to any vehicle using purely
computer vision. The system continuously monitors the road ahead and utilizes artificial
intelligence to analyze potential hazards. The driver-facing camera performs landmark detection
on the driver’s face to recognize distractions, pose, and yaw. The system alerts the
driver in real-time to avoid collisions — a major benefit for fleets, insurers and
automotive OEMs. Reduced distractions and collision avoidance leads to better underwriting
outcomes and loss control for insurers and commercial fleets. The DrivebuddyAI system is
not just safer for fleets, but is also used for more accurate driver logging, fleet utilization,
and visual mapping. We believe that our ADAMATICS solution has an opportunity to become a
fundamental part of the commercial auto insurance market.
2.Brokerage
Solutions
We
have built a distribution platform that allows Roadzen to sell insurance policies from any insurer and offer these products through multiple
distribution channels using simple APIs. The result is a comprehensive, integrated user experience from quote to policy to claim. Our
underwriting and claims are done using our AI platform, and the financial risk is assumed by leading insurers and reinsurers. We do not
hold any balance sheet risk.
Currently,
the digital brokerage competitive environment is focused on selling the available insurance products without innovating the insurance
product itself. Roadzen’s IaaS platform, with its unique capabilities, gives its distribution business a competitive edge. The
platform’s capabilities include:
●Product
creation and underwriting: Our technology can be used by insurers to make underwriting decisions
for their customers, the platform has ingested years of data to train and improve its algorithms’
policy pricing capabilities. We have built and launched traditional auto, UBI and driver
score-based insurance policies with our partners.
●Re-insurer
backing: Roadzen has cultivated partnerships with global reinsurers, which provides Roadzen
with the ability to co-create products using our technology and in turn provide them to our
customers.
●API
Exchange: Roadzen’s insurance marketplace is agnostic as to the insurer, geography
and product, enabling Roadzen to launch new products, enter new markets, and serve any vehicle
category. Our API benefits end-customers with access to a single window of real-time quote
information from all participating insurers and a seamless claims management experience.
Our
Revenue Model
Roadzen’s
business is centered around the B2B2C model, using the Roadzen technology and ecosystem to provide better underwriting capabilities,
a more efficient claims management process, RSA, and a digitized policy pricing engine to fleet, insurance, and car company customers.
Our vision is to be the lowest cost of distribution brokerage business in the market. Retail customer acquisition costs are very high
for insurers, but Roadzen does not spend on acquiring retail customers directly. Roadzen incurs costs on the B2B front, including sales
and marketing costs, to onboard the channel partners, which consist of dealers, fleet companies, agents, car companies, and strategic
tie-ups. This enables Roadzen to bundle its ecosystem offerings to its customers. This approach has resulted in consistent revenue streams.
7
Roadzen
deploys its solutions to insurers as a technology provider. It serves as a SaaS provider to auto insurers that embed our offerings with
their end customers. Insurers benefit from more efficient underwriting processes and reduced claims processing costs; in turn, their
customers secure a simplified online experience in claims reporting, risk evaluations, payments, and RSA. Insurers pay Roadzen a percentage
of premiums charged where Roadzen’s solutions are used for underwriting. Fixed fees per usage of Roadzen solutions is utilized
in damage assessments, claims management, and RSA. Through Roadzen’s proprietary specialty brokerage platforms in India and Europe,
where it targets OEMs, auto dealerships and commercial fleets, Roadzen operates on a B2B2C model. Roadzen secures a percentage of brokerage
commissions paid by insurers to brokers for distribution of their offerings. By embedding its solutions suite in brokerage offerings,
Roadzen secures two revenue streams: (i) brokerage commissions; and (ii) insurer payments for claims management and RSA. Both of Roadzen’s
sales channels, SaaS for insurers (indirect) and brokerage distribution (direct), target a unified customer base of car companies, fleets,
dealerships, and agents. Roadzen’s direct sales channels do not compete with insurers that use the SaaS solutions. Rather, Roadzen’s
MGA/brokerage service becomes a platform for the marketing and distribution of policies in which Roadzen’s solutions are embedded.
Our
Competition
We
believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the policy add-on
features we offer through bundling, the quality of our services, our technology, the diversity of products we offer, and the overall
costs to our customers.
Roadzen
believes that it is uniquely placed because of its technology that spans the entire insurance value chain. However, there is a threat
of competition to each individual product or service that we may provide.
Insurers
that choose to build similar offerings and technological expertise in-house present competition to the Company. Competition also exists
from other Insurtech companies that may be specifically focused on one part of the value chain. There are several telematics players
that are capable of building similar products to Roadzen, but very few have the breadth of comprehensive software, hardware and video
telematics capabilities that Roadzen possesses.
The
insurance brokerage business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets.
Competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation, knowledge, terms and condition of coverage, quality of service
and price. Our brokerage operations compete with both global firms and local firms that are focused on a particular region.
A
number of insurance carriers who choose to directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals, do not have to pay commissions to third-party
agents and brokers and can instead allocate those funds to their advertising and customer acquisition efforts. Roadzen believes that
by using its B2B2C strategy, rather than going directly to customer, it can have a lower cost of customer acquisition and insurance distribution.
Research
and Development
As
of March 31, 2025, Roadzen had 72 engineers, computer vision researchers and data scientists focused on building software to address
the challenges and complexity in auto insurance. Our product and engineering team focuses on enhancing our solutions to meet the complex
requirements of our customers with a focus on capabilities, operational efficiency, security, and privacy of our platform. We also invest
significantly in developing our products and customizing them for the specific market in which the customer operates, including the relevant
regulations, language, currency and payment methods.
We
believe AI will have a transformative impact on the insurance economy and have focused our efforts on deep learning technology. We have
released several new solutions incorporating real world AI at enterprise scale. Our team has developed over 150 AI models in computer
vision as well as natural language processing such as video inspection, driver scoring, vehicle, part and damage detection, driver distraction,
insurance GPT (policy summary and FAQ of any insurance policy), claims invoice automation, as well as road object detection and driver
facial landmark detection. We invest significantly into developing our internal tooling for AI through our proprietary Canvas platform
that allows ground truth generation, automated model selection, and continuous training and deployment of AI models.

Sales
and Marketing
Our
sales and marketing efforts are a key component of our growth strategy. Our investments in this area have enabled us to build and sustain
our customer base while creating long-term customer relationships.
Our
sales efforts are materially dependent on our three different channels: (1) strategic and contractual sales to insurers and car companies;
(2) sales to small-and-medium fleet owners; and (3) brokerage sales driven by agents, captive distribution channels and reinsurance partnerships.
We plan to continue investing in each of these channels of growth including hiring sales personnel, producing marketing content and event
marketing. We are investing heavily in content production and marketing focused on delivering rich, industry specific content on all
platforms that our clients use. This helps position Roadzen as a thought leader in the insurance and mobility space and adds to the lead
funnel for our business. We directly engage with decision-makers and industry leaders across the industry. Our top of the funnel digital
marketing efforts provide us with a platform to execute highly targeted outreach to important decision makers in our client matrix.
Our
sales teams are structured to address the different needs of our markets. For our small business sales efforts, we employ a geographically
dispersed account team structure to facilitate in-person demos and direct sales, along with an in-house sales team. For larger insurance
and automotive clients, we have an enterprise sales team. Roadzen has a large direct sales force spread across India, Europe, Southeast
Asia, the U.K. and the U.S. that focus on sales, on-boarding and customer management activities.
Fleets:
Fleet vehicles are groups of motor vehicles owned or leased by a business, government agency, or other organization rather than by an
individual or family. This set of customers is targeted directly by Roadzen’s sales team. Fleets are adversely affected when accidents
are followed by a slow and manual claims process, incurring a loss of revenue from the delay caused by the accident and the time needed
to repair the vehicle. This is a problem that Roadzen solves with its distinctive ecosystem. Roadzen has regional sales teams across
India, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and Southeast Asia. As fleets are usually on a local scale, our local sales teams are frequently within
reach of our potential fleet customers and faster to close a sale.
Insurance
& Car Companies: Sales to insurance companies and car companies are generally conducted either via a request for proposal (“RFP”)
or bid-driven process that requires demos, technical qualification criteria and financial pricing evaluation. These processes are highly
customized and require both in-house sales and solution architecture teams to close.
We
employ two primary sales activities for our brokerage business:
1.Motor
Insurance: As motor insurance contracts are generally of annual duration, the customers
give a “Broker on Record” mandate to Roadzen that authorizes Roadzen to advise
the customers to select the best insurance policy. As Roadzen operates a B2B brokerage business,
sometimes other value-added services offered by Roadzen are more valuable to customers than
the lowest premium offered by the competitors, such as faster claims processing, software
telematics and fleet management software. Hence Roadzen’s platform and ecosystem offers
Roadzen a competitive advantage.
2.Specialty
Insurance: These are long duration policies, generally starting with a 5-year duration,
where the risk underwriting is done at a portfolio level. Roadzen has partnered with re-insurers
to back the long-term risks associated with these long-tenure contracts. These contracts
are RFP-driven and may require additional negotiations with reinsurers. The RFP process for
our brokerage business is the same as our IaaS RFP process.
Our
People and Culture
We
have assembled a proven, global team with excellence and experience spanning technology, AI, insurance and mobility. As of March 31,
2025, we had 294 full-time employees and 14 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe we
have good relationships with our employees and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.

Our

problem solvers, collaborators and builders can thrive. Our people have a global mindset, a passion for innovation and play well with
others.

Our
Operating Principles
Take
Ownership
We
thrive on excellence, responsibility, and adaptability to change. In our largely non-hierarchical structure, we stress the need for our
personnel to hold themselves and each other accountable and to high standards. It also means striving for constant improvement to raise
our bar as a company. Ownership is about taking initiative and making decisions to deliver the highest quality outcome.
Be
meritocratic
As
no playbook exists for many of the problems we are solving, we look at the best ideas that we can bring to the table through rigorous
thought, debate and action. This is fostered by a culture of respect and kindness where everyone has a voice. We believe that backing
the best ideas with committed action is the key to building world class products.
Play
with purpose
We
have fun, indulge our curiosities, build for the long term, and do things differently. This is not just a job, it is a place to be authentic,
express yourself fully and bring purpose to what we at Roadzen are building.
Challenge
the status quo
To
us, innovation is the default mindset, a hardwired desire to improve things. The better we collaborate the more effective we are. Strong
teams are built when we embrace both.
Move
fast
Quick
and iterative feedback loops are critical to innovation in both software and AI products. This means we must move with urgency yet keep
a deliberate focus on the details to make sure our clients can rely on us to make fundamental business decisions.
Our
Customers
We
have strong customer relationships in the auto insurance market. These relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term
nature of our contracts and the interconnectedness of our network. As of March 31, 2025, we had customer agreements with 34 insurers
(including carriers, self-insurers and other entities processing insurance claims), 78 automotive clients, and approximately 3,800 agent
and fleet customers. As of March 31, 2025, our insurer clients made up less than 1% of the total number of clients, but approximately
30% of the enterprise client base (i.e., 34 of the 112 total insurers and automotive clients).
Key
customer ecosystems are as follows:
●Insurance
— including insurance companies, reinsurers, agents, brokers.
●Automotive
— including carmakers (OEMs), dealerships, online-to-offline car sales platforms.
●Fleets
— including small and medium fleets, taxicab companies, ridesharing platforms and commercial
and corporate fleets.
●Other
distribution channels such as financial services companies providing auto loans and telematics
companies.
And
key customer benefits from working with us can include:
●For
Insurers — faster, efficient and cheaper claims processing, lower combined operating
ratios, lower distribution costs and better underwriting models.
●For
Automotive — embedded or white-labeled products with better visibility on the insurance
distribution process for both new and renewal policies, extended warranty programs, faster
and more transparent claims settlements.
10
●For
Fleets — advanced road safety using telematics, lower premiums and faster claims processing.
Our
revenue is dependent on clients in the automotive insurance industry, OEMs and automotive fleets, and historically a relatively small
number of clients have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended March 31, 2025, we had three customers that
individually represented approximately 14%, 13% and 10% of our total revenue. During this same period, revenues from 10 customers collectively
accounted for approximately 67% of our total revenue.
Regulatory
Landscape
Our
insurance brokerage business is subject to various laws and regulations and our inability to comply with them may adversely affect our
business, results of operations and reputation.
Our
subsidiary in India received a certificate of registration to act as a direct insurance broker (life and general) under the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Insurance Brokers) Regulations, 2018 (“Insurance Brokers Regulations”). Accordingly,
we are subject to certain laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Insurance brokers are required to comply with various regulatory
requirements such as the following: (i) the principal officer and broker qualified persons of an insurance broker should have undergone
training and passed the relevant examination specified by the IRDAI, (ii) the principal officer, directors, promoters, partners, key
management personnel and persons having effective control of the insurance broker should fulfill the ‘fit and proper’ criteria
specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations, (iii) insurance brokers may not undertake multi-level marketing for solicitation and
procuring of insurance products, (iv) insurance brokers may not offer any rebate or any other inducement to a client, (v) insurance brokers
must conduct their business in compliance with the code of conduct specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations, and (vi) ensure
that not more than 50% of their remuneration emanates from one client in a financial year. The IRDAI may undertake inspection of the
premises of the insurance broker to ascertain how activities are carried on and inspect their books of accounts, records and documents.
The Insurance Brokers Regulations specify certain approval and reporting requirements to be adhered to by the insurance brokers from
time to time, as applicable. We would be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the Insurance Brokers Regulations.
We derive revenues primarily from commissions and other fees paid to us by the insurance carriers who sell their policies through our
platform.
The
commissions that we can charge to insurers are based on charges set forth under the IRDAI Commissions Regulations. The Minimum Information
Regulations, effective from May 23, 2021, are applicable to all insurers and insurance intermediaries in relation to purposes of investigation
and inspection by the IRDAI.
Inter-related
companies within the group are subject to a stringent regulatory framework that affects the flexibility of our operations and increases
compliance costs, and any regulatory action against us and our employees may result in penalties and/or sanctions that could have an
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
In
the United Kingdom, the FCA conducted a comprehensive review of the Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) product,
a key contributor to our operations in the U.K., resulting in a directive for all insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily
cease selling the GAP product in February 2024. The regulator has mandated that insurers make a resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining
the product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product can be resumed. The temporary suspension of GAP sales had a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall
profitability.

Item
1A. Risk Factors.
You
should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual
Report. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.
In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe
are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business or results of operations. For a summary of these
Risk Factors, see “Summary Risk Factors.”
Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry
We
have a history of losses and we anticipate increased expenses in the future.
We
have incurred net losses of $72.9 million and $99.7 million for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As a
result, we had an accumulated deficit of $224.3 million and $151.6 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We
anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to scale operations,
broaden our customer base, expand our sales and marketing activities, including expanding our sales team, hire additional employees,
and continue to develop our technology. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant
additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as we transition to being a public company. These efforts may prove more expensive
than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these higher
expenses. Revenue growth may slow, or revenue may decline, for several possible reasons, including slowing demand for our services
or increasing competition. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses
could prevent us from achieving or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis.
A
substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of clients ranging from insurers, OEMs and automotive fleets,
and the loss of any of these clients, or a significant revenue reduction from any of these clients, could materially impact our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
As
of March 31, 2025, we had 34 insurance customer agreements (including carriers, self-insureds and other entities processing insurance
claims), compared to 33 in the prior year; 78 automotive customer agreements in fiscal 2025 compared to 68 in the prior year; and approximately
3,800 agents and fleet customer agreements in fiscal 2025 compared to approximately 3,200 in the prior year. Roadzen’s insurer
clients made up less than 1% of Roadzen’s total number of clients, but approximately 30% of Roadzen’s enterprise client base
(i.e., 34 of the 112 total insurers and automotive clients).
Our
revenue is dependent on clients in the automotive insurance industry, OEMs and automotive fleets, and historically a relatively small
number of clients have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended March 31, 2025, we had three customers that
individually represented approximately 14%, 13% and 10% of our total revenue. During this same period, revenues from 10 customers collectively
accounted for approximately 67% of our total revenue.
We
expect that Roadzen will continue to depend upon a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable
future. As a result, if we fail to successfully renew our contracts with one or more of these customers, or if any of these customers
reduce or cancel services or defer purchases, or otherwise terminate their relationship with us, our business, results of operations
and financial condition would be adversely impacted. Some of our IaaS arrangements with our customers can be canceled or not renewed
by our customers after the expiration of the engagement term, as applicable, on relatively short notice. Additionally, we may be involved
in disputes with our customers in the future and such disputes may impact our relationship with these customers. The loss of business
from any of our significant customers, including from cancellations or due to disputes, could materially impact our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
Recent
FCA regulations and guidelines may have an adverse impact on our business and operations.
The
FCA has the authority to suspend the sale of any insurance product sold within the U.K. and for which it has oversight if it does
not believe a firm or a product is protecting the interests of U.K. consumers. Effective February 2024, the FCA paused all sales of
the Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) product, a key contributor to our operations in the U.K., directing all
insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product. The regulator mandated insurers to make a
resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP
product could be resumed. Although our insurance partner, which is obligated to adhere to FCA guidelines, received approval to sell
GAP products, the resubmission and approval process had a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall
profitability.
Any new FCA-mandated suspension may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition,
including reputational damage, and potential loss of clients and customer confidence. The FCA may request submission of certain documents including any formal confirmation of financial support. Any adverse
findings, delays in responding, or inability to meet the FCA’s expectations could impact our regulatory standing in the U.K., affect
the ability to operate in that jurisdiction, or result in reputational harm. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
12
International
trade policies, including tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.
Although
our current business model is not directly reliant on the import or export of physical goods, recent trade policies and uncertainty related
thereto, including with respect to tariffs and other restrictions, have created a dynamic and unpredictable trade landscape, which may
indirectly adversely impact our business and operations. For example, many of our customers operate businesses that may be impacted by
trade policies, which may result in decreased demand for our services or extended sales cycles as customers assess the impact of evolving
trade policies on their operations and face increased costs or decreased revenue due to tariffs and trade restrictions.
Trade
disputes, trade restrictions, tariffs, and other political tensions between the U.S. and other countries may also exacerbate unfavorable
macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressures, foreign exchange volatility, financial market instability, and economic recessions
or downturns, which may also negatively impact customer demand for our services, delay renewals or limit expansion opportunities with
existing customers, limit our access to capital, or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. Ongoing tariff and macroeconomic
uncertainty may have and continue to contribute to volatility in the price of our Ordinary Shares.
While
we continue to monitor trade developments, the ultimate impact of these risks remains uncertain and any prolonged economic downturn,
escalation in trade tensions, or deterioration in international perception of U.S.-based companies could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, tariffs and other trade developments have and may
continue to heighten the risks related to the other risk factors described elsewhere in this report.
Our
larger clients have negotiating leverage, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales,
decreased revenue, lower average commissions earned and gross margins, and increased contractual liability risks, all of which could
harm our results of operations.
Some
of our clients include large OEMs, automotive fleets, and insurance companies globally. These customers have significant bargaining power
when negotiating new licenses, subscriptions or renewals of existing agreements and have the ability to buy similar products from other
vendors or develop such systems internally. These customers have sought and may continue to seek advantageous pricing and other commercial
and performance terms that may require us to develop additional features in the products we sell to them or add complexity to our client
agreements. Historically, we have had to reduce fees or commissions only on a few rare occasions involving volume-based discounts on
large contracts. However, we may in the future be required to reduce the average fixed fees and/or commissions charged for our products,
or otherwise agree to materially less favorable terms in response to these pressures. If we are unable to avoid reducing our fixed fees
and/or commissions or renegotiate our contracts on commercially reasonable terms, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
If
we are unable to attract new customers, our future revenue and results of operations will be harmed.
Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to underwrite insurance policies, distribute motor insurance, extended warranty and other
insurance policies, and manage insurance claims using our AI-based technology platform. Our ability to attract new customers will depend
on the perceived benefits and pricing of our services and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Other factors, many of
which are out of our control, may now or in the future impact our ability to attract new customers, including:
●potential
customers’ inexperience with or reluctance to adopt software-based and/or AI solutions
for their existing operations;
●potential
customers’ commitments to or preferences for their existing vendors;
●actual
or perceived switching costs;
●the
adoption of new, or the amendment of existing, laws, rules, or regulations that negatively
impact the utility of, or that require difficult-to-implement changes to, our services, including
deregulation that reduces the need for compliance functionality;
13
●our
failure to expand, retain, and motivate our sales and engineering personnel;
●our
failure to expand into new markets;
●our
failure to develop or expand relationships with existing partners or to attract new partners;
●our
failure to develop our application ecosystem and integrate with new applications and devices
used by potential customers;
●our
failure to help potential customers successfully deploy and use our solution; and
●general
macroeconomic conditions.
If
our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.
Our
rapid growth makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and increases the risk that we will not continue to grow at or near
historical rates.
We
have been growing rapidly over the last several years, with revenue of approximately $44.3 million and $46.7 million for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively As a result, our ability
to forecast our future results of operations is subject to several uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model
future growth. Many factors may contribute to declines in our revenue growth rate, including increased competition, slowing demand for
our IaaS solutions from existing and new customers, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, terminations of
contracts by our existing customers, and the maturation of our business, among others. Our recent and historical growth should not be
considered indicative of our future performance. Even if our revenue continues to increase over the long term, we expect that our revenue
growth rate may decline in the future because of a variety of factors, including the maturation of our business. We have encountered
in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks, and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing
industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect
or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations,
our growth rates may slow and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
We
may not be able to ensure the accuracy and completeness of product information and the effectiveness of our recommendation of insurance
products on our platform.
Our
end consumers rely on the insurance product information we provide to our clients. While we believe that such information is generally
accurate, complete and reliable, there can be no assurance that the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information can be maintained
in the future. If we provide any inaccurate or incomplete information on our platform due to either our own fault or that of our insurer
and reinsurer partners, or if we fail to present accurate or complete information of any insurance products which could lead to our customers’
failure to get adequate protection or us being warned or penalized by regulatory authorities or us being sued by our customers, our reputation
could be harmed and we could experience reduced user traffic on our platform, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.
Our
business depends on our brand, and if we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand and reputation cost-effectively, our business
and financial condition may be adversely affected.
We
believe that the brand identity we have developed and acquired has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also
believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing awareness and integrity of our brand and reputation are critical to achieving widespread
acceptance of our solutions and expanding adoption of our solutions to new customers in both existing and new markets. Maintaining and
enhancing our brand requires us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful or cost-efficient. We believe
that the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion
of our brand depends on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a reliable, useful, and valuable collection
of solutions at competitive prices. These factors are essential to our ability to differentiate our offerings from competing products.
In addition, our brand and reputation could be impacted if our end users or insured parties have negative experiences in the claims process,
which ultimately largely depends on the quality of service from our business customers, but also may depend on the insured’s perceived
value of its vehicle.
14
Maintaining
and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology innovator, to continue to provide high quality solutions
and protect and defend our brand names and trademarks, which we may not do successfully. We have not engaged in extensive direct brand
promotion activities, and we may not successfully implement brand enhancement efforts in the future. Our products and services generally
are branded and are likely associated with the overall experiences of a participant in the insurance economy, which is largely outside
of our control. Any brand promotion activities we undertake may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, the increased revenue
may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brand and reputation. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand
successfully or to maintain loyalty among our customers, we may fail to attract new customers and partners or retain our existing customers
and partners and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any negative publicity relating to our employees, partners,
or others associated with these parties, may also tarnish our own reputation simply by association and may reduce the value of our brand.
Damage to our brand and reputation may result in reduced demand for our solutions and increased risk of losing market share to competitors.
Any efforts to restore the value of our brand and rebuild our reputation may be costly and may not be successful.
Our
revenue growth rate in part depends on existing customers renewing and upgrading their contracts. A decline in our customer renewals
and expansions could adversely impact our future results of operations.
Our
customers have no obligation to renew their contracts for our solutions after the expiration of their contract periods, which may also
be terminable on demand or on short notice, and our customers may choose not to renew contracts for a similar mix of solutions. Our customers’
renewal rates may fluctuate or decline based on a number of factors, including dissatisfaction, changes in clients’ spending levels,
increased competition, changes in tax or data privacy laws or rules, prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors,
spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors, deteriorating general economic conditions, or legislative and
regulatory changes. If our customers terminate or do not renew their contracts or reduce the solutions purchased under their contracts,
our revenue could decline, and our business may be adversely impacted.
Our
future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional services to existing customers. If our efforts to sell our additional
solutions to our customers are not successful, our revenue growth could decrease and our business, results of operations, and financial
condition could be adversely impacted.
We
face risks associated with the growth of our business in new use cases.
Historically,
most of our revenue has been derived from sales relating to our offering of motor insurance brokerage services for use in connection
with AI, and solutions around vehicle inspection and claims through the use of AI. In recent periods, we have increased our focus on
AI for use in connection with customers’ vehicles and equipment. We plan to expand the use cases of our AI solutions, including
those where we may have limited operating experience, and may be subject to increased business, technology, and economic risks that could
affect our financial results. Entering new use cases and expanding in the use cases in which we are already operating with new AI will
continue to require significant resources, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful or beneficial to us. Historically,
sales to a new customer have often led to additional sales to the same client or similarly situated clients. To the extent we expand
into and within new use cases that are heavily regulated, we will likely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from
the governments and agencies which regulate those markets and industries. While our strategy of building AI for use in connection with
brokerage services and other use cases has proven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same penetration and organic
growth with respect to AI solutions for client vehicles and equipment or any other use cases that we pursue. Any failure to do so may
harm our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We
rely heavily on direct sales to sell automobile insurance brokerage services.
We
market and sell automobile insurance through a direct sales B2B2C model and we must expand our sales organization to increase our sales
to new and existing customers. As of March 31, 2025, our sales and business development team consisted of 124 members. We expect to continue
expanding our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, particularly our direct sales organization focused on sales
to large organizations. We also expect to dedicate significant resources to sales programs that are focused on these large organizations.
Once a new customer begins using our services, our sales team will need to continue to focus on expanding use of our services by that
customer, including increasing the number of AI solutions used by that customer across other use cases. All of these efforts will require
us to invest significant financial and other resources. If we are unable to expand and successfully onboard our sales force at sufficiently
high levels, our ability to attract new customers may be harmed, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to
hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve
desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales programs are not effective. We have experienced turnover
in our sales team members, which results in costly training and operational inefficiency. In order to increase our revenue, we expect
we will need to further build our direct sales capacity. Additionally, our entry into any new markets and use cases will require us to
develop appropriate internal sales capacity and to train our sales teams to effectively address these markets. If we are unsuccessful
in these efforts, our ability to grow our business will be limited, and our business, results of operations, prospects, and financial
condition will be adversely affected.
15
Our
current system of direct sales may not prove effective in maximizing sales of our services and solutions. Our solutions are complex and
certain sales can require substantial effort and outlay of cost and resources. It is possible that our sales team members will be unable
or unwilling to dedicate appropriate resources to support those sales. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive
programs for our internal sales team members, we may not be able to incentivize these parties to sell our solutions to customers and,
in particular, to large organizations. The loss of one or more of our sales team members in a given geographic area could harm our results
of operations within that area, as sales team members typically require extensive training and take several months to achieve acceptable
productivity.
Our
growth strategy depends on continued investment in and around the delivery of innovative AI solutions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering
the above mentioned AI solutions, it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
To
address demand trends across the automotive insurance economy, we have focused on and plan to continue focusing on the growth and expansion
of our AI solutions in the automotive insurance sector. This growth strategy has required and will continue to require a considerable
investment of technical, financial and sales resources. These investments may not result in an increase in revenues and we may not be
able to scale such investments efficiently, or at all, to meet customer demand and expectations. Our focus on our AI business may increase
our costs in any given period and may be difficult to predict over time.
Our
AI service arrangements also contain service level agreement clauses which may include penalties for matters such as failing to meet
stipulated service levels. The consequences in such circumstances could include monetary credits for current or future service engagements,
reduced fees for additional product sales, cancellations of planned purchases and a customer’s refusal to pay their contractually-obligated
fees. Should these penalties be triggered, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, any factor adversely affecting
sales of our solutions, including market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition
and economic and market conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Additionally, the entry into new markets or the introduction of new features, functionality or applications beyond our current markets
and functionality may not be successful. If we invest in the development of new products, we may not recover the “up-front”
costs of developing and marketing those products, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management, technical and financial resources
away from other development efforts. If we are unable to successfully grow our AI business and navigate our growth strategy in light
of the foregoing uncertainties, our reputation could suffer and our results of operations may be impacted, which may cause our stock
price to decline.
Changes
in the automotive insurance industry, including the adoption of new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, may significantly impact
our results of operations.
Aspects
of our business, and our customers’ businesses, which our products and services support, can be impacted by events in automotive
insurance which are beyond our control. Certain trends in the automotive industry, including the continued adoption of semi-autonomous
or autonomous vehicles and the advent of improved automotive safety features, may potentially impact the future market for, and operations
of, the automotive insurance industry. While the impacts and timing of these changes are currently unknown, if this has an adverse impact
on the automotive insurance industry, it could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations.
Our
customers may defer or forgo purchases of automobiles in the event of weakened global economic conditions or political transitions, which
in turn will affect purchases of our products or services.
Our
financial performance depends, in part, on the state of the economy. Declining levels of economic activity may lead to declines in spending
in the industries we serve, which may result in decreased revenue for us. Concerns about the strength of the economy may slow the rate
at which businesses are willing to enter into new contractual arrangements, potentially including those for our solutions. If our customers
and potential customers experience financial hardship as a result of a weakened economy, industry consolidation, or other factors, the
overall demand for our solutions could decrease. If economic conditions worsen, our business, results of operations, and financial condition
could be adversely impacted.
Global
events such as the imposition of various trade tariffs by the U.S. and China, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas
conflicts have created and may continue to create economic uncertainty, including inflationary pressures, in regions in which we have
significant operations. These conditions may make it difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities
accurately, and they could cause our customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our products, which could delay and lengthen
our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Moreover, during challenging economic times, our customers may be unable
to timely access sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may not
receive amounts owed to us and may be required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our financial
results. A substantial downturn in the insurance industry may cause firms to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital
expenditures, reducing their spending on information technology, delaying, or canceling information technology projects, or seeking to
lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. Negative or worsening conditions in the general economy in the U.S., the U.K., E.U.
and India, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations, could decrease corporate spending on enterprise
software in general, and in the insurance industry specifically, and negatively affect the rate of growth of our business.
16
Macroeconomic
factors impacting the principal industries we serve could adversely affect our product adoption, usage, or average selling prices.
We
expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from brokerage services and AI services we provide to the automotive industry, automotive
insurance industry and supporting economy, including the automotive collision and OEM industries. Given the concentration of our business
activities in this industry, we will be particularly exposed to certain economic downturns affecting the automotive and insurance industries.
Global market and economic conditions, as well as those in the U.S., the U.K., E.U. and India, have been, and continue to be, disrupted
and volatile. General business and economic conditions that could affect us and our customers include fluctuations in economic growth,
debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of credit, investor and consumer
confidence, and the strength of the economies in which our customers operate. A poor economic environment could result in significant
decreases in demand for our solutions, including the delay or cancellation of current or anticipated projects, or could present difficulties
in collecting accounts receivable from our customers due to their deteriorating financial condition. Our existing customers may be acquired
by or merged into other entities that use our competitors’ products, or they may decide to terminate their relationships with us
for other reasons. As a result, our sales could decline if an existing customer is merged with or acquired by another company that has
a poor economic outlook or is closed.
We
face competition in our market, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and cause
our market share to decline.
The
market for our solutions is competitive. The competitors we face in any sale opportunity may change depending on, among other things,
the line of business purchasing the service, the service being sold, the geography in which the customer is operating, and the size of
the customer to which we are selling. These competitors may compete on the basis of price, the time and cost required for implementation,
custom development, or unique product features or functions. Outside of our key markets, we are more likely to compete against vendors
that may differentiate themselves based on local advantages in language, market knowledge, and content applicable to that jurisdiction.
As
we expand our product portfolio, we may begin to compete with software and technology providers that we have not competed against previously
and whose technology and applications may, in time, become more competitive with our offerings.
We
expect the intensity of competition to remain high in the future, as the amount of capital invested in current and potential competitors,
including insurance technology companies, has increased significantly in recent years. As a result, our competitors or potential competitors
may develop improved product or sales capabilities, or even a technology breakthrough that disrupts our market. Continuing intense competition
could result in increased pricing pressure, increased sales and marketing expenses, or greater investments in research and development,
each of which could negatively impact our profitability. Current and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to,
or take greater risks in connection with, the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can devote to ours, which could
allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs, thus leading to their wider market
acceptance. We may not be able to compete effectively, and competitive pressures may prevent us from acquiring and maintaining the customer
base necessary for us to increase our revenue and profitability.
In
addition, the insurance industry is evolving rapidly, and we anticipate the market for edge-based and cloud-based AI solutions will become
increasingly competitive. If our current and potential customers move a greater proportion of their data and computational needs to the
cloud, new competitors may emerge that offer services either comparable to or better suited than ours to address the demand for such
cloud-based AI solutions, which could reduce demand for our offerings. To compete effectively we will likely be required to increase
our investment in research and development, as well as the personnel and third-party services required to improve reliability and lower
the cost of delivery of our cloud-based solutions. This may increase our costs more than we anticipate and may adversely impact our results
of operations.
Our
current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to further enhance
their resources and offerings. Current or potential competitors may be acquired by other vendors or third parties with greater available
resources. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies
and customer needs, to devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, to initiate or withstand substantial
price competition, or to take advantage of emerging opportunities by developing and expanding their product and service offerings more
quickly than we can. Additionally, they may hold larger portfolios of patents and other intellectual property rights as a result of such
relationships or acquisitions. If we are unable to compete effectively with these evolving competitors for market share, our business,
results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
17
If
we are unable to develop, introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our services and products, we may be put at a competitive
disadvantage and our operating results could be adversely affected.
As
technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, both within the automotive insurance economy and more broadly across the insurance ecosystem,
the possibility of the development of technological advancements made by other firms will increase. If we are unable to internally develop
or acquire suitable alternatives to such developments or otherwise deploy competitive offerings our business and growth opportunities
may be challenged. Additionally, certain automotive insurance ecosystem customers may seek to develop internal solutions which could
potentially compete with our related offerings. Technologies such as enhanced modeling, AI and machine learning technology may offer
certain firms, including insurance carriers, the opportunity to make rapid advancements in the development of tools which may impact
the industry broadly.
New
products utilize and will continue to be based on AI technologies in the future. As such, the market acceptance of AI-based solutions
is critical to our continued success. In order for cloud-based AI solutions to be widely accepted, organizations must overcome any concerns
with placing sensitive information on a cloud-based platform. Furthermore, our ability to effectively market and sell AI-based solutions
to customers is partly dependent upon the pace at which enterprises undergo digital transformation. Additionally, as technologies continue
to become more integrated with AI technologies generally, governments may implement data privacy and AI regulations with which we will
need to comply, and which may result in the incurrence of additional costs and expenses.
We
expect that the needs of our customers will continue to rapidly change and increase in complexity and we will need to improve the functionality
and performance of our platform continually to meet these demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve
more widespread market acceptance of enterprise AI solutions in general or on our platform in particular, our business operations, financial
results, and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
Our
sales and implementation cycles can be lengthy and variable, depend upon factors outside our control, and could cause us to expend significant
time and resources prior to generating revenue.
Sales
cycles for some of our solutions are complex and can be lengthy and unpredictable, requiring pre-purchase evaluation by a significant
number of employees in our customers’ organizations, and can involve a significant operational decision by our customers. Our sales
efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our solutions, including in the technical capabilities and the
potential cost savings achievable by organizations using our solutions. For larger business opportunities, such as converting a new automotive
insurance customer, customers undertake a rigorous pre-purchase decision-making and evaluation process which typically involves due diligence
and reference checks. We invest a substantial amount of time and resources in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts
will produce sales. Even if we succeed at completing a sale, we may be unable to predict the size or term of an initial AI-based arrangement
until very late in the sales cycle. In addition, we sometimes commit to include custom functions in our base product offering at the
request of a customer or group of customers. Providing this additional functionality may be time consuming and may involve factors that
are outside of our control. Customers may also insist that we commit to certain time frames in which systems built around our solutions
will be operational, or that once implemented our solutions will be able to meet certain operational requirements. Our ability to meet
such time frames and requirements may involve factors that are outside of our control, and failure to meet such time frames and requirements
could result in us incurring penalties, costs and/or additional resource commitments, which could adversely affect our business and results
of operations.
Unexpected
delays and difficulties can occur as customers implement and test our solutions. Solutions can involve integration with our customers’
and third-party’s systems as well as the addition of customer and third-party data to our platform. This process can be complex,
time-consuming, and expensive for our customers and can result in delays in the implementation of our solutions, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Time-consuming efforts such as client setups, training and transition
of systems may also increase the amount of services personnel we must allocate to each customer, thereby increasing our costs for these
services. These types of changes can also result in a shift in the timing of the recognition of revenue which could adversely affect
results of operations and financial condition. The timing of when we sign a large contract can materially impact our results of operations
for the period and can be difficult to predict.
18
Developing
significant revenue streams derived from our current research and development efforts may take several months or years, or may not be
achieved at all.
Developing
AI solutions is time consuming and costly, and investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. Our future plans include
significant investments to develop, improve and expand the functionality of our solutions, which we believe is necessary to maintain
our competitive position. However, we may not recognize significant revenue from these investments for several months or years, or the
investments may not yield any additional revenue.
There
are limited key underwriting carrier partners in our insurance markets, and we may not be able to find suitable replacements for our
existing carriers in the event such replacements become necessary.
Roadzen
works with a limited number of carriers in the U.S., India, the U.K. and E.U. for its automobile insurance products, and there is a risk
that if one or more of the carriers becomes impaired or terminates its relationship with Roadzen that Roadzen’s revenues and profitability
may be adversely affected. If a carrier partner relationship terminates or there is loss of strategic support or alignment, we may be
unable to transition to a new relationship without disruption, increased cost, lost profits, or lost market share, or a combination of
the foregoing.
We
derive a large portion of our revenue from commissions on the sale of automotive insurance products in India, the U.K. and E.U. If a
carrier were to experience liquidity problems or other financial (such as rating agency downgrades) or operational difficulties, we could
encounter business disruptions as a result, and our results of operations may suffer.
Sales
to customers or operations outside the U.S., India and the U.K./E.U. may expose us to risks inherent in international sales.
Historically,
transactions occurring outside of the three core markets, the U.S., India, and the U.K./E.U., have represented a small portion of our
overall processed transactions. However, we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. Operating in international
markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that
are different from those in these three core markets. Because of our limited experience operating outside these three markets, our international
expansion efforts outside of these three core markets may not be successful. We may rely heavily on third parties outside of the three
core markets, and as a result we may be adversely impacted if we invest time and resources into such business relationships but do not
see significant sales from such efforts. Potential risks and challenges associated with sales to customers and operations outside of
our core markets include, but are not limited to:
●compliance
with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment,
tax, money transmission, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;
●increased
travel, real estate, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs associated with international
operations;
●laws
and business practices favoring local competitors;
●new
and different sources of competition;
●new
integrations for international technology platforms;
●localization
of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages, obtaining and maintaining
local content, and customer care in such languages;
●treatment
of revenue from international sources and changes to tax rules, including being subject to
foreign tax laws and liability for paying withholding or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;
●fluctuation
of foreign currency exchange rates;
●greater
difficulty collecting accounts receivable, longer sales and payment cycles, and different
pricing environments;
●challenges
inherent in efficiently managing, and increased costs associated with, an increased number
of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate
systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;
●restrictions
on the transfer of funds;
●inconsistent
or irregular availability of reliable Internet connectivity in areas targeted for expansion;
●limited
or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining,
protecting, or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks and patents,
or obtaining necessary intellectual property licenses from third parties;
19
●natural
disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, or security breaches;
●import
and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;
●compliance
with sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury;
●compliance
with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (“FCPA”) and the UK Bribery Act (“UKBA”); and
●regional
or national economic and political conditions.
As
we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage
these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, results
of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.
We
may experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely impact our results of operations.
Our
business has a substantial international focus, and our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies. These non-U.S. revenues
could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast
with reliable accuracy. We typically collect revenue and incur costs in the currency of the location in which we provide our solutions
and services, but our long-term contracts with customers make it difficult for us to predict if our operating activities will provide
a natural hedge in the future or as we expand internationally. We currently do not have any foreign currency hedging agreements or arrangements.
Our results of operations may also be impacted by transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and liability
balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Moreover,
significant, and unforeseen changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to fail to achieve our stated projections for revenue
and operating income, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. As we expand internationally, we will continue to experience
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which, if material, may harm our revenue or results of operations.
If
we do not continuously develop AI that is compatible with third-party hardware, software, and infrastructure, including the many evolving
insurance industry standards, our ability to introduce and sell new services could be adversely affected.
In
order to support customers’ adoption of our services, we develop AI that is compatible with a wide variety of hardware, software
and other technology infrastructure. Not only must we ensure our AI is compatible with applications and technologies developed by our
partners and vendors, but we must also ensure that our AI can interface with third-party hardware, software, or other technology infrastructure
that our customers may choose to adopt. To the extent that a third party were to develop AI applications that compete with ours, that
provider may choose not to support our solution. In particular, our ability to accurately anticipate evolving insurance standards and
ensure that our AI application comply with these standards in all relevant respects is critical to the functionality of our services.
Any failure of our AI to be compatible or comply with the hardware, software, or infrastructure — including insurance standards
— utilized by our customers could prevent or delay their implementation of our AI and require costly and time-consuming engineering
changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of reinsurers or subscribers adopt the standards to which we design our AI, our ability
to introduce and sell subscriptions to our customers could be harmed.
The
competitive position of our AI depends in part on its ability to operate with a wide variety of data sources and infrastructure, and
if we are not successful in maintaining and expanding the compatibility of our solutions with such data sources and infrastructure, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
The
competitive position of our AI depends in part on its ability to operate with a wide array of physical sensors and devices — including
devices manufactured by third parties, other software and database technologies, and communications, networking, computing, and other
infrastructure. As such, we must continuously modify and enhance our AI to be compatible with evolving hardware, software, and infrastructure
that are used by our current and potential partners, vendors, and customers. In the future, one or more technology companies may choose
not to support the interoperation of their hardware, software, or infrastructure with solutions such as ours, or our solutions may not
otherwise support the capabilities needed to operate with such hardware, software, or infrastructure. We intend to facilitate the compatibility
of our AI with a wide variety of hardware, software, and infrastructure by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships.
If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
20
We
rely on data, technology, and intellectual property of third parties and our solutions rely on information generated by third parties.
Any interruption of our access to such information, technology, and intellectual property could materially harm our operating results.
We
use data, technology, and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our products, and we may license
additional third-party data, technology, and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party data, technology,
and intellectual property could result in errors that could adversely impact our brand and business. In addition, licensed data, technology,
and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to license
and distribute this third-party data, technology, and intellectual property could limit the functionality of our products and might require
us to redesign our products. Our success depends significantly on our ability to provide our customers access to data from many different
sources, including, for example, parts-related data for purposes of repair estimation. We obtain much of our data about vehicle parts
and components and collision repair labor and costs through license agreements with third parties who may be sole-source suppliers of
that data.
If
one or more of our licenses are terminated, if our licenses are subject to material price increases, or if we are unable to renew one
or more of these licenses on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to access necessary information without incurring additional
costs or, for instance in the case of information licensed from sole-service suppliers, unable to access alternative data sources that
would provide comparable information. While we do not believe that our access to many of the individual sources of data is material to
our operations, prolonged industry-wide price increases or reductions in data availability could make receiving certain data more difficult
and could result in significant cost increases, which could materially harm our operating results.
Our
solutions or products or our third-party cloud providers have experienced in the past, and could experience in the future, data security
breaches, which could adversely impact our reputation, business, and ongoing operations.
As
a software business, we face risks of cyber-attacks, including ransomware and phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, computer
break-ins, theft, fraud, misappropriation, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, and other improper activity that could jeopardize the performance
of our platform and solutions and expose us to financial and reputational impact and legal liability, especially with regards to regulators
such as the FTC, which has become increasingly aggressive in prosecuting alleged failure to secure personal data as unfair and deceptive
acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act the (“FTC Act”). In addition, each of Global Insurance Management
Limited and National Automobile Club may be subject to additional cyber-security risks, borne of existing systems-wide vulnerabilities,
that could jeopardize the performance of their platforms and expose us to similar financial and reputational impact and legal liability,
especially with regards to regulators such as the FTC.
Furthermore,
such adverse impact could be in the form of theft of our or our customers’ confidential information, the inability of our customers
to access our systems, or the improper re-routing of customer funds through fraudulent transactions or other frauds perpetrated to obtain
inappropriate payments and may result from accidental events (such as human error) or deliberate attacks. To protect the information
we collect and our systems, we have implemented and maintain commercially reasonable security measures and information security policies
and procedures informed by requirements under applicable law and recommended practices, in each case, as applicable to the data collected,
but we cannot be sure that such security measures will be sufficient. In some cases, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by third
parties to protect against security threats. These third parties, including vendors that provide products and services for our operations,
could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Our network
of business application providers could also be a source of vulnerability to the extent their business applications interface with ours,
whether unintentionally or through a malicious backdoor. We cannot, in all instances, review the software code included in third-party
integrations. Although we vet and oversee such vendors, we cannot be sure such vetting and oversight will be sufficient. We also exercise
limited control over these vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions
or delays experienced in connection with these vendor technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact
our relationships with partners and adversely affect our business and could expose us to liabilities. Because the techniques used to
obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, generally are not recognized until launched against a target,
and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we or these third parties may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to
implement adequate preventative measures. With the increasing frequency of cyber-related fraud to obtain inappropriate payments, we need
to ensure our internal controls related to authorizing the transfer of funds are adequate. We may also be required to expend resources
to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cybersecurity. Any of these occurrences could create liability
for us, put our reputation in jeopardy, and adversely impact our business.
21
Our
customers provide us with information that our solutions store, some of which is sensitive and/or confidential information about them
or their financial transactions. In addition, we store personal information about our employees and, to a lesser extent, those who purchase
products or services from our customers. We have security systems and information technology infrastructure designed to protect against
unauthorized access to and disclosure of such information. The security systems and infrastructure we maintain may not be successful
in protecting against all security breaches and cyber-attacks, including ransomware and phishing attacks, social-engineering attacks,
computer break-ins, theft, fraud, misappropriation, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, and other improper activity. Threats to our information
technology security can take various forms, including viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attempt to attack our
solutions or platform or to gain access to the data of our customers or their customers. Non-technical means, for example, actions or
omissions by an employee or trespasser, can also result in a security breach. Any significant violations of data privacy could result
in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory fines or investigations, loss of customers, and penalties that could damage our reputation
and adversely affect the growth of our business. It is possible, however, that claims could be denied or exceed the amount of our applicable
insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even
if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and
could divert management’s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may negatively
impact our customer relationships, market acceptance of our solutions, including unrelated solutions, or our reputation and business.
We
may not be able to prevent or address the misappropriation of Roadzen-owned data.
From
time to time, third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, bots, or other means and aggregate this data on their
websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites or mobile apps may misappropriate data and attempt to imitate
our brand or the functionality of our website or our mobile app. If we become aware of such websites or mobile apps, we intend to employ
technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites or mobile
apps in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations.
In
some cases, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the effect of the operation of such websites or mobile apps.
Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites or mobile apps, any measures that
we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations,
or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and
business could be harmed.
Real
or perceived failures in our solutions, an inability to meet contractual service levels, or unsatisfactory performance of our services,
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Because
we offer solutions that operate in complex environments, undetected or other errors or failures may exist or occur, which may lead to
unsatisfactory performance of our services resulting in termination of our contracts, especially when solutions are first introduced
or when new versions are released, implemented, or integrated into other systems. Our solutions are often used in environments with different
operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our
solutions or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our solutions. Despite testing by us, we may not identify all errors,
failures or bugs in new solutions or releases until after commencement of commercial sales or installation. In the past, we have discovered
errors, failures, and bugs in some of our solutions after their introduction. We may not be able to fix errors, failures, and bugs without
incurring significant costs or an adverse impact to our business. The occurrence of errors in our solutions or the detection of bugs
by our customers may damage our reputation in the market and our relationships with our existing customers, and as a result, we may be
unable to attract or retain customers. We believe that our reputation and name recognition are critical factors in our ability to compete
and generate additional sales. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective
solutions and services. The failure to do so may result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our solutions and services,
which could adversely impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The
license and support of our software creates the risk of significant liability claims against us. Our IaaS arrangements and licenses with
our customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims. It is possible, however, that the limitation
of liability provisions contained in such agreements may not be enforced as a result of international, federal, state and local laws
or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. Breach of warranty or damage liability, or injunctive relief resulting from such claims,
could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Any
disruption of our Internet connections, including to any third-party cloud providers that host any of our websites or web-based services,
could affect the success of our IaaS solutions.
Any
system failure, including network, software, or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in our network or a decrease in the responsiveness
of our website or our IaaS solutions could result in reduced user traffic, reduced revenue and potential breaches of our IaaS arrangements.
Continued growth in Internet usage could cause a decrease in the quality of Internet connection services. Websites have experienced service
interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the worldwide Internet network infrastructure. In addition,
there have been several incidents in which individuals have intentionally caused service disruptions of major websites. If these outages,
delays, or service disruptions occur frequently in the future, usage of our web-based services could grow more slowly than anticipated
or decline and we may lose customers and revenue.
22
If
the third-party cloud providers that host any of our websites or web-based services were to experience a system failure, the performance
of our websites and web-based services, including our IaaS solutions, could be adversely impacted. Currently, we utilize third-party
cloud providers to host our websites and web-based services. Any disruption of, or interference with, our use of these third-party cloud
providers could impair our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation,
loss of customers and adverse impact to our operations and our business. In general, third-party cloud providers are vulnerable to damage
from fire, floods, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, war or political upheaval, power loss, telecommunications failures, electronic intrusion
attempts from both external and internal sources, and similar events. If we decided to switch cloud providers or consolidate cloud providers
for any reason, it may require significant resources to execute the resulting migrations.
The
controls implemented by our current or future third-party cloud providers may not prevent or timely detect system failures and we do
not control the operation of third-party cloud providers that we use. Any changes in service levels by our current or future third-party
cloud providers could result in loss or damage to our customers’ stored information and any service interruptions at these third-party
cloud providers could hurt our reputation, cause us to lose customers, adversely impact our ability to attract new customers or subject
us to potential liability. Our current or future third-party cloud providers could decide to close their facilities without adequate
notice. In addition, financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by our current or future third-party cloud providers, or any of
the service providers with whom we or they contract, may have negative effects on our business. If our current or future third-party
cloud providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity or any spikes in customer demand, it could have an adverse
effect on our business. Our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully compensate us for losses
that may occur. Additionally, systems redundancies and disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not be sufficient to overcome
the failures of third-party providers hosting our IaaS solutions.
In
addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to our website.
These providers could experience outages, delays, and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any of these
events could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We
may acquire or invest in companies, or pursue business partnerships, which may divert our management’s attention or result in dilution
to our shareholders, and we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits
of such acquisitions, investments, or partnerships.
We
expect to continue to grow, in part, by making targeted acquisitions in addition to our organic growth strategy. Our business strategy
includes the potential acquisition of shares or assets of companies with businesses complementary to ours, both domestically and globally.
Our strategy also includes alliances with such companies. Acquisitions and alliances may result in unforeseen operating difficulties
and expenditures and may not result in the benefits anticipated by such corporate activity.
In
particular, we may fail to assimilate or integrate the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel or operations of the acquired
companies, retain key personnel necessary to favorably execute the combined companies’ business plans, or retain existing customers
or sell acquired products to new customers. Acquisitions and alliances may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources, and
require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business. In addition,
we may be required to make additional capital investments or undertake remediation efforts to ensure the success of our acquisitions,
which may reduce the benefits of such acquisitions. We also may be required to use a substantial amount of our cash or to issue debt
or equity securities to complete an acquisition or realize the potential of an alliance, which could deplete our cash reserves and/or
dilute our existing stockholders and newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.
23
Additionally,
the assumptions we use to evaluate acquisition opportunities may not prove to be accurate, and intended benefits may not be realized.
Our due diligence investigations may fail to identify all the problems, liabilities or other challenges associated with an acquired business
which could result in increased risk of unanticipated or unknown issues or liabilities, including with respect to environmental, competition
and other regulatory matters, and our mitigation strategies for such risks that are identified may not be effective. As a result, we
may not achieve some or any of the benefits, including anticipated synergies or accretion to earnings, that we expect to achieve in connection
with our acquisitions, we may not accurately anticipate the fixed and other costs associated with such acquisitions, or the business
may not achieve the performance we anticipate, any of which may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows, as well as our stock price. Further, if we fail to achieve the expected synergies from our acquisitions
and alliances, we may experience impairment charges with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, or other items, particularly if business
performance declines or expected growth is not realized. Any future impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given regarding the accuracy or reasonability
of such projections and assumptions. No assurance can be given that we may be able to achieve some or all such benefits, economies of
scale or synergies that we expect to achieve in connection with these acquisitions, including achieving accretion to earnings, achieving
fixed and other costs associated with such acquisitions, or achieving the anticipated performance. Any failure to achieve such benefits,
economies of scale or synergies or unanticipated challenges we may face in such integration would adversely affect our business, prospects,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our stock price. Further, such failure would result in impairment
charges with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, or other items, particularly if business performance declines or expected growth
is not realized.
Further,
following an acquisition or the establishment of an alliance offering new solutions, we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue
that we receive from the sale of solutions that we acquired or that result from the alliance, or from the sale of a bundle of solutions
that includes such new solutions. In addition, our ability to maintain favorable pricing of new solutions may be challenging if we bundle
such solutions with sales of existing solutions. A delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of acquired or alliance solutions,
or reduced pricing due to bundled sales, may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results, may adversely affect our operating
margins, and may reduce the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.
Additionally,
competition within the insurance industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets has been, and is expected to continue
to be, intense. Acquisitions could become the target of regulatory reviews, which could lead to increased legal costs, or could potentially
jeopardize the consummation of the acquisition. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to pursue,
the target may be acquired by another strategic buyer or financial buyer such as a private equity firm, or we may otherwise not be able
to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
If
we are unable to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to support our operations and fulfill our obligations, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We
actively monitor and manage our cash and cash equivalents so that sufficient liquidity is available to fund our operations and other
corporate purposes. In the future, increased levels of liquidity may be required to adequately support our operations and initiatives
and to mitigate the effects of business challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to achieve and sustain such increased
levels of liquidity, we may suffer adverse consequences, including reduced investment in our platform development, difficulties in executing
our business plan and fulfilling our obligations, and other operational challenges. Any of these developments could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We
are subject to key person risk because we rely on the expertise of our CEO, senior management team, and other key employees. If we are
unable to attract, retain, or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, our business may be severely impacted.
Our
success depends on the ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Our CEO is
an integral part of the Roadzen brand and his departure would likely create difficulty with respect to both the perception and execution
of our business. Additionally, the loss of a member of our senior management team, specialized experts or key personnel might significantly
delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic business objectives and could harm our business. We rely on a small number of highly
specialized experts, the loss of any one of whom could have a disproportionate impact on our business. Our compensation arrangements,
such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing
employees. Moreover, if and when our stock options or other equity awards are substantially vested, employees under such equity arrangements
may be more likely to leave, particularly when the underlying shares have seen a value appreciation.
Our
inability to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of management and personnel with the necessary skills and experience could
impede our ability to deliver growth objectives and execute our operational strategy. As we continue to expand and grow, we will need
to promote or hire additional staff, and it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals in a timely manner and without incurring
significant additional costs. Furthermore, several members of our management team were hired recently. If we are not able to integrate
these new team members or if they do not perform adequately, our business may be harmed.
24
If
we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business and competitive position may be harmed.
We
believe that our success to date has been driven in large part by our company’s cultural principles of focusing on customer success,
building for the long term, adopting a growth mindset, being inclusive and winning as a team. As the Company grows and develops the infrastructure
of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture
could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and
pursue our corporate objectives. As a result, if we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be
harmed.
We
typically provide service-level commitments under our subscription agreements. Failure to meet these contractual commitments could lower
our revenue and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our
subscription agreements typically contain service-level commitments, and our agreements with larger customers may carry higher service-level
commitments than those provided to customers generally. If we are unable to meet the stated service-level commitments, including failure
to meet the service requirements under our subscription agreements, we may face subscription terminations and a reduction in renewals,
which could significantly affect both our current and future revenue. We offer multiple tiers of subscriptions to our products and, as
such, our service-level commitments will increase if more customers choose higher tier subscriptions. Any service-level failures could
also damage our reputation, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Roadzen
is exposed to interest rate risk through the course of our normal operations. Rising interest rates could have a negative impact on our
cash flows as interest expense would likely increase on any debt undertaken.
Our
consolidated balance sheets include assets and liabilities with estimated fair values that are subject to the interest rate, which impacts
the fair value of our liabilities as well as interest rate risks associated with any investments made in fixed income securities.
We
may need to raise additional funding to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms,
or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.
Since
our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our core technology and product platforms.
We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we build and enhance our capabilities
and commercialize our products. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, as well as
marketing and selling existing and new products. These expenditures are expected to include working capital, costs of acquiring and building
out new facilities, and the cost of attracting and retaining a skilled labor force. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.
As
of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.8 million. During the period ended March 31, 2025, the Company
incurred a net loss of approximately $72.8 million and had cash flows used in operating activities of approximately $18.1 million.
Our
business prospects are subject to risks, expenses, and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of commercial
operations. To date, we have been funded primarily by equity and debt financings, including the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred
stock.
Based
on our history of losses, we do not expect that we will be able to fund our longer-term capital and liquidity needs to execute our business
plan and pursue our strategic goals through our cash balances and operating cash flows alone. To fund our longer-term capital and liquidity
needs, we expect we will need to secure additional capital. However, our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending
on, among other things:
●the
number and characteristics of any additional products we develop or acquire to serve new
or existing markets;
●the
scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements
to existing products;
●the
expenses associated with our sales and marketing initiatives;
●our
investment to expand our service offerings;
25
●the
costs required to fund domestic and international growth;
●any
lawsuits, arbitration, or other legal proceedings related to our products or commenced against
us;
●the
expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;
●the
costs associated with being a public company;
●the
costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing intellectual
property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and
●the
timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if
any.
We
may obtain future additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations.
Such financings may result in dilution to shareholders, issuance of securities with priority as to liquidation and dividend and other
rights more favorable than ordinary shares, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely
affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even
if we believe that we have sufficient funds for current or future operating plans. There can be no assurance that financing will be available
to us on favorable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain financing when needed may make it more difficult for us to operate our business
or implement our growth plans and we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development
activities, growth and expansion plans, establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary or
desirable to generate revenue and achieve profitability.
Our
management has limited experience in operating a public company.
Our
executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or
effectively manage a public company such as Roadzen that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations
under U.S. securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could
be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will
result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of our company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate
level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required
of public companies in the U.S. In addition, each of Global Insurance Management Limited and National Automobile Club may also have inadequate
internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the U.S. The development and implementation of the standards
and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the U.S. may require costs
greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our
operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.
We
will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance
initiatives.
As
a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses
may increase even more after we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. As a public
company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley
Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), as well as rules adopted,
and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these
compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance
costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs may increase our net loss. For example, we expect
these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for it to obtain director and officer liability insurance and
we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot
predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements
could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees,
or as executive officers.
26
The
current conflicts between Ukraine and Russia and between Israel and Hamas have exacerbated market instability and disrupted the global
economy.
The
current conflicts between Ukraine and Russia and between Israel and Hamas have caused uncertainty about economic and political stability,
increasing volatility in the credit and financial markets, and disrupting the global economy. The U.S., the E.U., and several other countries
are imposing far-reaching sanctions and export control restrictions on Russian entities and individuals. These sanctions and export controls
may also contribute to higher oil and gas prices and inflation, which could reduce demand in the global automotive sector and therefore
reduce demand for our solutions. There is also a risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action to sanctions, may launch cyberattacks against
the U.S., the E.U., or other countries or their infrastructures and businesses. Additional consequences of the conflict may include diminished
liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, and various shortages and supply chain
disruptions. While we do not currently directly rely on goods or services sourced in Russia or Ukraine and thus have not experienced
any direct disruptions, we may experience indirect disruptions in our supply chain. Any of the foregoing factors, including developments
or effects that we cannot yet predict, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Risks
Relating to Regulatory and Legal Matters
We
are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased
both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.
We
are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection
of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable
law, including the laws of the BVI. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely
to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating
activities to compliance activities.
Moreover,
because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time
as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations
and any subsequent changes, it may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.
As
a managing general agency/underwriter in the U.K./E.U. market, and an insurance broker in India, we operate in a highly regulated environment
for our insurance product distribution and face risks associated with compliance requirements, some of which cause us to make judgment
calls that could have an adverse effect on us.
The
insurance broking industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to regulation and supervision both
federally and in each applicable local state or provincial jurisdiction as per the particular geography. In general, these regulations
are designed to protect members, policyholders, and insureds and to protect the integrity of the financial markets, rather than to protect
shareholders or creditors. Our ability to conduct business in these jurisdictions depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by federal and state or provincial regulatory bodies and other regulatory authorities. Maintaining compliance with rules
and regulations is often complex and challenging, and it sometimes requires us to make a judgment call regarding the level of risk associated
with a requirement, which could have an adverse effect on us.
There
can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt effectively and timely to any changes in law. A failure to comply with regulatory requirements,
or changes in regulatory requirements or interpretations, can result in actions by regulators, potentially leading to penalties and enforcement
actions, and in extreme cases, revocation of an authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. This could result in adverse publicity
and potential damage to our brand and reputation in the marketplace. In addition, we could face lawsuits by members, insureds, and other
parties for alleged violations of these laws and regulations.
State
insurance laws grant supervisory agencies, including state insurance departments, broad administrative authority. In India, the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority (“IRDAI”), the FCA, and, in the U.S., state insurance regulators and the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners continually review existing laws and regulations, some of which affect our business. These supervisory agencies
regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and other insurance intermediaries;
the handling of third-party funds held in a fiduciary capacity; and trade practices, such as marketing, advertising, and compensation
arrangements entered into by insurance brokers and agents. Individuals who engage in the solicitation, negotiation, or sale of insurance,
or provide certain other insurance services, generally are required to be licensed individually. Insurance laws and regulations govern
whether licensees may share commissions with unlicensed entities and individuals. We believe that generally any payments we make to third
parties are in compliance with applicable laws. However, should any regulatory agency take a contrary position and prevail, we will be
required to change the manner in which we pay fees to individuals and entities for placing insurance policies through us.
27
In
India, insurance brokers are required to comply with various regulatory requirements as prescribed under the Insurance Act, 1938, the
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 and the relevant rules and regulations thereunder, each as amended from time
to time (collectively, “Indian Insurance Broker Laws”). Because of the complexities of the Indian Insurance Broker Laws,
we have had prior experiences with lapses in filings or disclosures in compliance with the Indian Insurance Broker Laws. While past lapses
could be attributed to technical lapses and human errors, we are setting up a system to track and monitor compliance with the regulatory
requirements under applicable laws. Currently, although there are no notices or penalty imposed by IRDAI in respect of such lapses, such
lapses could result in actions by IRDAI, potentially leading to penalties and enforcement actions, which in extreme cases, among things,
could lead to revocation of license to operate as a licensed insurance broker. In determining the penalties, the discretion of the regulatory
agencies in imposing penalties is generally guided by facts and circumstances of a specific case, particularly, the gravity of the violation
and the bona fide of the parties involved. There can be no assurance that the penalties imposed by the regulator while regularizing such
past lapses will not adversely affect our business or financial conditions.
We
may be subject to periodic inspections by IRDAI for our insurance broker in India. In the event that we are unable to comply with the
observations made by the IRDAI or comply with IRDAI’s directions at any time in the future, we could be subject to penalties and
restrictions which may be imposed by the IRDAI. Imposition of any penalty or adverse finding by the IRDAI during any future inspection
may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We
cannot assure you that we will not be subject to any adverse regulatory actions by regulators in the future. The costs of compliance
may be high, which may affect our profitability. If we are unable to comply with any such regulatory requirements, our business and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Regulatory
review or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations may result in the enactment of new laws and regulations that
could adversely affect our operations or our ability to conduct business profitably. It is difficult to predict whether, and to what
degree, changes resulting from new laws and regulations will affect the industry or our business.
The
U.S. federal government or independent standards organizations may implement significant regulations or standards that could adversely
affect our ability to produce or market our products.
Our
products transmit radio frequency waves, the transmission of which is governed by the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission (“FCC”), as well as other federal and state agencies. Further, to the extent our AI requires the use of electronic
logging devices (“ELDs”), they are subject to regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”)
and may be subject to similar regulations in other countries in which they are used. Among other challenges, compliance with ELD regulations
often requires reading and interpreting diagnostic information from commercial motor vehicle engines, which can prove challenging given
the diversity of commercial motor vehicles in our customers’ fleets, the continuous release of vehicles of new makes, models, and
years with potentially different diagnostic communication protocols, and the lack of standardization of diagnostic communication protocols
across OEMs. Our ability to design, develop and sell our products will continue to be subject to these rules and regulations, as well
as many other federal, state, local and foreign rules, and regulations, for the foreseeable future.
The
implementation of unfavorable regulations or industry standards, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or
regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected products to become impractical,
or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our solution. The adoption of new industry standards applicable to our
products may require us to engage in rapid product development efforts that would cause us to incur higher expenses than we anticipated.
In some circumstances, we may not be able to comply with such standards, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate
revenues through the sale of our products.
We are currently and
may in the future become a party to litigation, which could result in damage to our reputation and harm our future results of operations.
From
time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Meteora, as described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) in
this Annual Report (collectively, the “Meteora Litigation”). While we are seeking significant damages against Meteora, we
may not prevail in the Meteora Litigation, and may have to pay damages to Meteora. In addition, litigation, including the Meteora Litigation,
might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which might harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. While we believe that we can partially mitigate the risk and severity of exposure from these lawsuits
through contractual provisions in certain of our agreements with insurance carriers, and carrying our own insurance that we believe is
adequate to cover adverse claims arising from these lawsuits or similar lawsuits that may be brought against us, we may not have adequate
contractual protection in all of our contracts and defending these and similar litigation is costly, diverts management from day-to-day
operations, and could harm our brand and reputation. As a result, we may ultimately be subject to a damages judgment, which could be
significant and exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from coverage.
Regardless
of the outcome of any future litigation, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion
of management resources, harm to our reputation, and other factors. See “Business — Legal Proceedings.”
28
Failure
to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose
customers or otherwise harm our business.
Our
business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible
for monitoring and enforcing compliance with various legal obligations, covering topics including privacy and data protection, telecommunications,
intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, the environment, consumer protection, governmental trade sanctions, import
and export controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, securities, and tax. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may
be more stringent than in the U.S. These laws and regulations impose added costs on our business. Noncompliance with applicable regulations
or requirements could subject us to:
●investigations,
enforcement actions, and sanctions;
●mandatory
changes to our solutions and services;
●disgorgement
of profits, fines, and damages;
●civil
and criminal penalties or injunctions;
●claims
for damages by our customers or channel partners;
●termination
of contracts;
●loss
of intellectual property rights; and
●temporary
or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations.
If
any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant
diversion of our management’s attention and resources and an increase in fees to professionals and/or consultants. Enforcement
actions and sanctions could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Additionally,
companies in the technology industry have recently experienced increased regulatory scrutiny. Any reviews by regulatory agencies or legislatures
may result in substantial regulatory fines, changes to our business practices, and other penalties, which could negatively affect our
business and results of operations. Changes in social, political, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide
range of topics may cause us to change our business practices. Further, our expansion into a variety of new use cases for our solution
could also raise a number of new regulatory issues. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
Our
failure to comply with the requirements of applicable environmental legislation and regulation could have a material adverse effect on
our revenue and profitability.
Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations. In addition, certain
states and countries may pass new regulations requiring our products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components.
For example, the E.U. has issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products. The Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment Directive (“WEEE”) makes producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for the
collection, reuse, recycling, treatment, and disposal of equipment placed in the E.U. market. The Restrictions of Hazardous Substances
Directive (“RoHS”) bans the use of certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment which are put on the
market in the E.U. In the future, the governments of various countries, including the United States, or other state or local governments,
may adopt further environmental compliance programs and requirements. If we fail to comply with these regulations in connection with
the manufacture of our telematic devices, we may face regulatory fines, changes to our business practices, and other penalties, and may
not be able to sell our devices in jurisdictions where these regulations apply, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue
and profitability.
29
We
are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection,
and data security. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
We
receive, collect, store, process, transfer, and use personal information and other data relating to users of our solutions, our employees
and contractors, and other persons. For example, one of our AI-based telematics systems collects video information of our customers,
and certain of our AI applications collect and store facial recognition data, which is subject to heightened sensitivity and regulation.
We have legal and contractual obligations regarding the protection of confidentiality and appropriate use of certain data, including
facial recognition data and other personal information. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and international laws, directives,
and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure,
and protection of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may
be inconsistent across jurisdictions or conflict with other legal and regulatory requirements. We are also subject to certain contractual
obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection and data security. We strive to comply with our applicable policies
and applicable laws, regulations, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and data
security to the extent possible. However, the regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and data security worldwide is currently,
and is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, uncertain and complex, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged obligations
may be interpreted and applied in a manner that we do not anticipate or that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may
conflict with other legal obligations or our practices. Further, any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices
regarding the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of data, or their interpretation, or any changes regarding the manner
in which the consent of users or other data subjects for the collection, use, retention or disclosure of such data must be obtained,
could increase our costs and require us to modify our AI, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may
limit our ability to store and process user data or develop new features.
We
also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information
security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, the data protection landscape in Europe is currently evolving, resulting
in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risks to our business. The E.U. adopted the General Data Protection
Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and contains numerous requirements and changes from previously
existing European Union laws, including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection
compliance programs by companies. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates the transfer of personal data subject to the GDPR to third
countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the U.S. Failure to comply with the
GDPR could result in penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to the greater of €20 million and 4% of our global
annual turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations, as well as the right to compensation for financial
or non-financial damages claimed by individuals under Article 82 of the GDPR).
In
addition to the GDPR, the European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on a person’s right
to conduct a private life. The proposed legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “ePrivacy
Regulation”), would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as
the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated.
Various
United States privacy laws are potentially relevant to our business, including the Federal Trade Commission Act, Controlling the Assault
of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Any actual
or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in a costly investigation or litigation resulting in potentially significant
liability, loss of trust by our users, and a material and adverse impact on our reputation and business.
Additionally,
in June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new data privacy rights for
California consumers and new operational requirements for covered companies. Specifically, the CCPA provides that covered companies must
provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new data privacy rights that include the right to request a
copy from a covered company of the personal information collected about them, the right to request deletion of such personal information,
and the right to request to opt-out of certain sales of such personal information. The CCPA became operative on January 1, 2020. The
California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA, including by seeking an injunction and civil penalties for violations. The CCPA also
provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may require
us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. A new privacy law, the
California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election and is effective
as of January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional
costs and expenses in an effort to comply. A number of other states, such as Illinois, Texas, Washington, Virginia, and Colorado, have
implemented, or are considering implementing, their own versions of privacy legislation, which could increase our potential liability
and cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and otherwise adversely affect our business. Some of those
laws, including Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, also provide consumers with a private right of action for certain
violations and large potential statutory damages awards. Recent litigation around these laws has encouraged plaintiffs’ attorneys
to bring additional actions against other targets, and because some of our products employ technology that may be perceived as subject
to these laws, we and our customers may become subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, damages and penalties under these
laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our financial condition. Further, in March 2017, the U.K.
formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union.
The U.K. ceased to be a E.U. Member State on January 31, 2020, but enacted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and which
provides for substantial penalties in a manner similar to the GDPR (up to the greater of £17.5 million and 4% of our global annual
turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations). It is unclear how the U.K. data protection laws or regulations
will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated. Further, some countries also
are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity
of delivering our services.
30
We
are also subject to legislation and regulations in India under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
each as amended from time to time, including the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal
Data or Information) Rules, 2011 and the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.
Further, the laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain
types of data in India may continually change as a result of new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, changes in the enforcement
policies and changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations by the courts or the regulators. For example, the Personal Data
Protection Bill, 2019 (the “PDP Bill”) was introduced to propose a legal framework governing the processing of personal data.
However, the PDP Bill was withdrawn on August 3, 2022. Following this, the Government of India is considering the enactment of the Digital
Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022 on personal data protection for implementing organizational and technical measures in processing
personal data and lays down norms for cross-border transfer of personal data and to ensure the accountability of entities processing
personal data. The enactment of the aforesaid bill may introduce stricter data protection norms for a company such as ours and may impact
our processes. If this or similar legislation is enacted, we may incur additional compliance costs and it may affect us in ways that
we are currently unable to predict.
Any
failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third
parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or data security, may result
in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups
or others and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect
our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, other obligations,
and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for,
our solution. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations, such violations
may put our users’ data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims,
or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose
trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about,
technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if unrelated to our business, industry or operations,
may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory
requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks.
Failure
to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside
of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We
are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act,
the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the Indian Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988 and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering
laws in countries where we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption
laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or
indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose
of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any improper advantage. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries
with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable
laws and regulations. In addition, we use third parties to sell subscriptions to our solution and conduct our business abroad. We or
our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned
or affiliated entities, and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our
employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Similarly, some
of our customers may be state-owned, in each case exposing us to additional potential risks.
These
laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent
any such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees or third-party
intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.
Any
violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints,
adverse media coverage, investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions and suspension or debarment from government contracts, which
could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, responding
to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense
costs and other fees for professionals and/or consultants.
31
We
are subject to stringent and changing privacy and data security laws, regulations, and standards related to data privacy and security.
Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our reputation, subject us to significant fines and liability,
or adversely affect our business.
In
the U.S., insurance companies are subject to the privacy provisions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Model Act, to the extent adopted and implemented
by various state legislatures and insurance regulators. The regulations implementing these laws require insurance companies to disclose
their privacy practices to consumers, allow them to opt-in or opt-out, depending on the state, of the sharing of certain personal information
with unaffiliated third parties, and require them to maintain certain security controls to protect information in their possession. Violators
of these laws face regulatory enforcement action, substantial civil penalties, injunctions, and in some states, private lawsuits for
damages.
Privacy
and data security regulation in the U.S. is rapidly evolving. For example, California recently enacted the CCPA, which became effective
January 1, 2020. The CCPA and related regulations give California residents expanded rights to access and request deletion of their personal
information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is
used and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches,
which is expected to increase the volume and success of class action data breach litigation. In addition to increasing its compliance
costs and potential liability, the CCPA’s restrictions on “sales” of personal information may restrict Roadzen’s
use of cookies and similar technologies for advertising purposes. The CCPA excludes information covered by Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the
Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “California Financial Information Privacy Act”)
from the CCPA’s scope, but the CCPA’s definition of “personal information” is broad and may encompass other information
that Roadzen maintains. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation
in the U.S., and multiple states have enacted or proposed similar laws. There is also discussion in Congress of new comprehensive federal
data protection and privacy law to which Roadzen likely would be subject if it is enacted.
In
addition, California voters approved the November 2020 ballot measure which will enact the CPRA, substantially expanding the requirements
of the CCPA. As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA gives consumers the ability to limit use of precise geolocation information and other categories
of information classified as “sensitive” and add e-mail addresses and passwords to the list of personal information that,
if lost or breached, would give the affected consumers the right to bring private lawsuits. The law increases the maximum penalties threefold
for violations concerning consumers under age 16, and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the
new law, as well as impose administrative fines. The effects of the CCPA, CPRA and other similar state or federal laws are potentially
significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance costs and subject us
to increased potential liability.
In
the E.U. we face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the GDPR 2016/679 and
other data protection regulations. Among other stringent requirements, the GDPR restricts transfers of data outside of the E.U. to countries
deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the U.S.), unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the GDPR is implemented.
A July 16, 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated a key mechanism for lawful data transfer to the U.S.
and called into question the viability of its primary alternative. As such, the ability of companies to lawfully transfer personal data
from the E.U. to the U.S. is presently uncertain. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data
transfer rules or data localization requirements. These developments could limit the Company’s ability to deliver its products
in the E.U. and other foreign markets. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory
fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way Roadzen processes data.
Additionally,
we are subject to the terms of its privacy policies, privacy-related disclosures, and contractual and other privacy-related obligations
to our customers and other third parties. Any failure or perceived failure by us or third parties Roadzen works with to comply with these
policies, disclosures, and obligations to customers or other third parties, or privacy or data security laws may result in governmental
or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, criminal compliance orders, litigation or public statements against
Roadzen by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause customers to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an
adverse effect on our business.
32
We
rely on some mobile applications to execute our business strategy. Government regulation of the Internet and the use of mobile applications
in particular is evolving, and unfavorable changes could seriously harm our business.
Roadzen
relies on some mobile application to execute components of its business strategy. Roadzen is subject to general business regulations
and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and the use of mobile applications in
particular. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet or other online services, and increase the
cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content
protection, electronic contracts and communications, electronic signatures and consents, consumer protection and social media marketing.
It is at times not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply
to the Internet and the use of mobile applications in particular, as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent
of the Internet and the use of mobile applications and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet. It is
possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet and the use of mobile applications
in particular, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with
other rules or our practices. Roadzen cannot be sure that its practices have complied, currently comply, or will comply fully with all
such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by it to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage
to its reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or
action could hurt its reputation, force it to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract its management, increase
its costs of doing business and decrease the use of its mobile application or website by consumers and suppliers and may result in the
imposition of monetary liability. Roadzen may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs
or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations.
Changes
in, or violations by us or our customers of, applicable government regulations could reduce demand for or limit our ability to provide
our software and services in those jurisdictions.
Our
automotive insurance industry customers are subject to extensive government regulations, mainly at the state level in the U.S. and at
the country level in our non-U.S. markets. Some of these regulations relate directly to our software and services, including regulations
governing the use of total loss and photo estimating software. If our insurance company customers fail to comply with new or existing
insurance regulations, including those applicable to our services, they could lose their certifications to provide insurance and/or reduce
their usage of our software and services, either of which would reduce our revenues. If our products or services are found to be defective,
we could be liable to them. In addition, future regulations could force us to implement costly changes to our software and/or databases
or have the effect of prohibiting or rendering less valuable one or more of our offerings. Also, we are subject to direct regulation
in some markets, and our failure to comply with these regulations could significantly reduce our revenues or subject us to government
sanctions.
We
may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and may be affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations, any of which
could adversely impact our results of operations.
Roadzen
and its subsidiaries are expected to be subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United
States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory
tax rates. Moreover, our tax position could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, changes in U.S. federal, state or international
tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including
the United States, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. Any
of the foregoing changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. For
example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and imposes a minimum tax
on certain corporations with book income of at least $1 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and a 1% excise tax on certain stock
buybacks (including certain redemptions) and similar corporate actions. Any of these or similar developments or changes in U.S. federal,
state or non-U.S. tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.
We
may in the future be obligated to pay income tax in India.
We
must certify annually that we are not an Indian domiciled company for Indian income tax purposes. Establishing that we are not an Indian
domiciled company requires an evaluation of certain parameters and conducting certain tests to the satisfaction of the tax authorities
in India. There is a risk that now or at some point in the future, we will not be able to satisfy the requirements of the tax authorities
in India. If we were unable to meet these requirements, we would be considered an Indian domiciled company by the tax authorities in
India and would consequently incur income tax charges in India.
33
Risks
Relating to Intellectual Property
Failure
to protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Our
success depends in part on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark,
trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to do so.
In
the future we may file patent applications related to certain of our innovations. We do not know whether those patent applications will
result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, we may not receive
competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Our existing patents and any patents
granted to us or that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent
third parties from infringing these patents. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain
and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that vary based on the local law of the relevant jurisdiction.
Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practice with respect to
enforcement of intellectual property rights. Patent protection must be obtained on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and we only
pursue patent protection in countries where we think it makes commercial sense for the given product. In addition, if we are unable to
maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property,
including because such agreements terminate, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Therefore, the extent of the protection afforded by these patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, given the costs, effort,
risks and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may
choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations; however, such patent protection could later prove to be important to our
business.
Patent
law reform in the U.S. and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights, or make such enforcement financially
unattractive. For instance, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which permits enhanced third-party
actions for challenging patents and implements a first-to-file system. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice
v. CLS Bank made it easier to invalidate software patents. These legal changes could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual
property or limit our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products in these jurisdictions.
We
also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have pursued and will pursue the registration of
trademarks, logos and service marks in the U.S. and internationally; however, enforcing rights against those who knowingly or unknowingly
dilute or infringe our brands can be difficult. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken and will take to protect our proprietary
rights in our brands and trademarks will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe, dilute or misappropriate our brands, trademarks,
trade dress or other similar proprietary rights. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours or use confusingly similar terms
as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly creating
confusion in the marketplace. In addition, trade name or trademark infringement claims could be brought against us by owners of other
registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our trademarks. Any claims or customer confusion related to our trademarks
could damage our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business and results of operations.
We
attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by generally requiring our employees, contractors,
and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements,
all of which offer only limited protection. These agreements may not effectively prevent, or provide an adequate remedy in the event
of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Despite our efforts to protect
our confidential information, intellectual property, and technology, unauthorized third parties may gain access to our confidential proprietary
information, develop and market solutions similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, any of which could materially impact our
business and results of operations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and confidential information, and
in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Existing U.S. federal, state and international intellectual
property laws offer only limited protection. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to as
great an extent as the laws of the U.S., and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as governmental agencies
and private parties in the U.S. More broadly, enforcing intellectual property protections outside the U.S., including in some countries
we operate in, can be more challenging than enforcement in the U.S. The Company takes certain actions when operating in countries where
protection of IP, technology and confidential information, is not as well protected, including steps such as preventing placing sensitive
IP in such countries, as an example. Moreover, policing our intellectual property rights is difficult, costly and may not always be effective.
From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our
trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement
or invalidity. Even if we are successful in defending our claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources
and could negatively affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that we seek to enforce
our rights, we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid, otherwise not enforceable, or is licensed to
the party against whom we are pursuing a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party
seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us, which could adversely impact our business.
If we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell or license a particular solution due to an
injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, governments may
adopt regulations, or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others, or governments
may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property
rights under these circumstances may adversely impact our competitive position and our business. If we are unable to protect our technology
and to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others
who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create the innovative solutions that have enabled us to be successful
to date.
34
There
can be no assurance that our patents or patent applications will be enforceable or otherwise upheld as valid.
Any
patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have obtained or may obtain may be challenged by others or invalidated,
circumvented, abandoned or lapse. As of March 31, 2025, we had no U.S. trademarks or pending applications, and we had seven registered
non-U.S. trademarks and one pending non-U.S. trademark applications.
As
of March 31, 2025, we had no U.S. patents and pending applications, and three registered non-U.S. patents, one registered non-U.S. design
and two pending non-U.S. patent applications.
As
of March 31, 2024, we had no U.S. patents and pending applications, and three registered non-U.S. patents, one registered non-U.S. design
and two pending non-U.S. patent applications.    There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in
issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain further patent protection for
our technology. There can also be no assurance that our patents or application will be equally enforceable or otherwise protected by
the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions.
In
addition, given the costs, effort, risks and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose
the invention to the public, we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations; however, such patent protection could
later on prove to be important to our business. Further, any patents may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully
challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual
property rights are uncertain.
We
may enter into joint ventures, collaborations or sponsored developments for intellectual property and, as a result, some of our intellectual
property may, in the future, be jointly owned by third parties.
Engagement
in any type of intellectual property collaboration agreement requires diligent management of intellectual property rights. Other than
in specific, limited circumstances, such as a joint venture we are party to in India where we have majority ownership of the joint venture
entity. Roadzen does not currently engage in joint ventures, collaborations or sponsored development agreements. Should Roadzen decide
to pursue such agreements in future, the development of joint intellectual property would create additional administrative and financial
burdens, and may place Roadzen at heightened risk of disputes or litigation regarding ownership, maintenance or enforcement of such joint
intellectual property.
Assertions
by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and
substantially harm our business and results of operations.
The
Insurtech industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry own large numbers of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us. From time to time, third parties holding such
intellectual property rights, including companies, competitors, patent holding companies, customers and/or non-practicing entities, may
assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property claims against us, our customers and partners, and those from whom
we license technology and intellectual property.
Although
we believe that our solutions do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, any such assertions may require
us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation, or result in us being unable to use certain intellectual property.
Infringement assertions by third parties may involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product revenue,
and therefore our own issued and pending patents may provide little or no deterrence to these patent owners in bringing intellectual
property rights claims against us.
If
we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out
of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such
claims. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, such a claim could adversely impact our brand and business. Furthermore, an adverse
outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to
have willfully infringed a party’s intellectual property; cease making, licensing or using our solutions that are alleged to infringe
or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into
potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or works; and to indemnify
our partners, customers and other third parties. Any of these events could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
35
Confidentiality
agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
To
protect our trade secrets, confidential information and distribution of our proprietary information, we generally enter into confidentiality,
non-compete, proprietary, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements
with other parties. We also have entered into confidentiality agreements to protect our confidential information delivered to third parties
for research and other purposes. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to trade secrets,
confidential information and distribution of our proprietary information, especially in certain U.S. states and countries that are less
willing to enforce such agreements. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies
that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and confidential
information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation
could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions,
and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors’ obtainment of our trade secrets or independent development
of unpatented technology similar to ours or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position.
In
order to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor
and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and
to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming,
and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts
to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability
of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology against unauthorized
copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further
sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in
our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our brand and reputation.
Our
exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions.
Our
exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level
of visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.
Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior
to our acquisition.
Any
of these results could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks have been amplified by the increase
in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.
Our
use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.
Few
of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be
construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solution or other
products we may develop in the future. We also rely upon third-party, non-employee contractors to perform certain development services
on our behalf, and we cannot be certain that such contractors will comply with our review processes or not incorporate software code
made available under open source licenses into our proprietary code base.
We
may be found to have used open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license
or our current policies and procedures. For example, certain kinds of open source licenses may require that any person who creates a
product or service that contains, links to, or is derived from software that was subject to an open source license must also make their
own product or service subject to the same open source license. If these requirements are found to apply to our products and we fail
to comply with them, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we offer additional portions of our solutions
for no cost, that we make available additional source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating
or using the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source
licenses.
36
If
an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions
of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could
be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open source software, or required to comply
with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products. In addition,
there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open source software against companies that incorporate open source software
into their products, and the licensors of such open source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims.
Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our solution will be effective.
In any of these events, we and our customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our
products, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished
on a timely basis. We and our customers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or violation
due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend or subject
us to an injunction.
Some
open source projects provided on an “as-is” basis have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities which, if used
in our product and not properly addressed, could negatively affect the security or performance of our product. Any of the foregoing could
require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, could result in customer dissatisfaction,
and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Some
of our services and technologies use “open source” software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or
require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses.
Some
of our services and technologies incorporate software licensed under so-called “open source” licenses. In addition to risks
related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software,
as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Additionally, some open source licenses
require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open
source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software,
when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software
with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.
We
take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, and does not incorporate, open source software in ways that
would require our proprietary software to be subject to many of the restrictions in an open source license. However, few courts have
interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some
uncertainty. Additionally, we rely on our technology team of 72 professionals that includes software programmers, data scientists and
design team to develop our proprietary technologies, and although we take steps to prevent our programmers from including objectionable
open source software in the technologies and software code that they design, write and modify, we do not exercise complete control over
the development efforts of our programmers and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not incorporated such open source software
into our proprietary products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary
technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of
our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each
of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our business, results
of operations, and prospects.
In
the past, companies that have incorporated open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open
source software or compliance with open source license terms. Accordingly, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership
of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms.
Indemnity
provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation,
violation, and other losses.
Our
agreements with customers and other third parties have in some cases included indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify
them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation, damages
caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our solution or other contractual obligations.
Large indemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Pursuant to certain agreements, we
do not have a cap on our liability and any payments under such agreements would harm our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to some of these indemnity obligations, we may still
incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects
on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.
37
We
may become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs
of doing business.
Third
parties have claimed and may in the future claim that our operations and applications infringe their intellectual property rights, and
such claims have resulted and may result in legal claims against our customers and us. These claims may damage our brand and reputation,
harm our customer relationships, and result in liability for us. We expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of applications
and the level of competition in our market grows, the functionality of our solution overlaps with that of other products and services,
and the volume of issued patents and patent applications continues to increase. We have agreed in various agreements to indemnify customers
for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third-party intellectual property infringement claims associated with our solution.
To the extent that any claim arises as a result of third-party technology we use in our solution, we may be unable to recover from the
appropriate third party any expenses or other liabilities that we incur.
Companies
in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own patents, copyrights, trademarks,
and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property
rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual
property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them than we do. Furthermore, patent holding companies, non-practicing
entities, and other patent owners that are not deterred by our existing intellectual property protections may seek to assert patent claims
against us. Third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners,
our technology partners, or our customers. We have received notices and been subject to litigation (and we may be subject to litigation
in the future) that claims we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to
the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims,
which is not uncommon with respect to the enterprise software market. These and other possible disagreements could lead to delays in
the collaborative research, development or commercialization of our systems, or could require or result in costly and time-consuming
litigation that may not be decided in our favor. Any such event could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.
There
may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents, that cover significant aspects of our technologies
or business methods. In addition, if we acquire or license technologies from third parties, we may be exposed to increased risk of being
the subject of intellectual property infringement due to, among other things, our lower level of visibility into the development process
with respect to such technology and the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. These claims may damage our brand and reputation,
harm our customer relationships, and create liability for us.
Any
intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate, and could
divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages,
potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, and may require us to indemnify
our customers for liabilities they incur as a result of such claims. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology
found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which
may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties,
which would increase our operating expenses. Alternatively, we could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which
could require significant time, effort, and expense, and may affect the performance or features of our solution. If we cannot license
or develop alternative non-infringing substitutes for any infringing technology used in any aspect of our business, we would be forced
to limit or stop sales of our solution and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business
operations and financial condition.
Risks
Relating to Operations in India
We
are subject to various labor laws, regulations and standards in India. Non-compliance with and changes in such laws may adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We
are required to comply with various labor and industrial laws in India and the rules made thereunder (each as amended from time to time),
which include relevant shops and establishment legislations depending on the States of India in which we operate, the Employees State
Insurance Act, 1948, the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment
of Bonus Act, 1965, the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,
Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and the Contract Labour (Regulation
and Abolition) Act, 1970. Because of the complexities of the applicable labor laws in India, we have had prior experiences with lapses
in compliance with applicable labor laws. While past lapses could be attributed to technical lapses and human errors, we are setting
up a system to track and monitor compliance with the regulatory requirements under applicable labor laws. Currently, although there are
no notices or penalty imposed by relevant labor authorities in respect of such lapses, such lapses could result in actions by such authorities,
potentially leading to civil and/or criminal penalties and enforcement actions, which in extreme cases, among things, could lead to revocation
of licenses or registrations to operate our business. In determining the penalties, the discretion of the regulatory agencies in imposing
penalties is generally guided by facts and circumstances of a specific case, particularly, the gravity of the violation and the bona
fide of the parties involved. There can be no assurance that the penalties imposed by the regulator while regularizing such past lapses
will not adversely affect our business or financial conditions.
38
The
Government of India has notified four labor codes, namely, (i) the Code on Wages, 2019, (ii) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, (iii)
the Code on Social Security, 2020 and (iv) the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. While certain provisions
of the Code on Wages, 2019 and the Code on Social Security, 2020 have been brought in force, the effective date of the four labor codes
is yet to be notified, and they shall come into force from such date as may be notified by the Government of India. The new codes, if
implemented, will subsume several separate legislations, and will introduce several new changes, such as introducing a single registration
and license for Indian companies, and provide uniformity in providing social security benefits to employees, which was earlier segregated
under different legislations and had different applicability and coverage. We may incur increased costs and other burdens relating to
compliance with such new requirements, which may also require significant management time and other resources, and any failure to comply
may adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition.
A
portion of our business and operations are located in India and we are subject to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties
in India.
A
portion of our business and some of our employees are located in India, and we intend to continue to develop and expand our business
in India. Consequently, our financial performance and the market price of our ordinary shares may be affected by changes in exchange
rates and controls, interest rates, volatility in and actual or perceived trends in trading activity on India’s principal stock
exchanges, prevailing economic conditions, changes in government policies, including taxation policies and foreign investment policies,
social and civil unrest and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting India. The Government of India has exercised
and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy. Since 1991, successive Indian governments have
generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms, including by significantly relaxing restrictions
on the private sector. Nevertheless, the role of the Indian central and state governments in the Indian economy as producers, consumers
and regulators has remained significant and we cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue. The rate of economic
liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting travel service companies, e-commerce, data, foreign investments,
currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investments in India could change as well or be subject to unfavorable changes, interpretations,
or uncertainty, including by reason of limited administrative or judicial precedents. There can be no assurance that the Government of
India may not implement new regulations and policies, which will require us to obtain approvals and licenses or impose onerous requirements
and conditions on our operations. A significant change in India’s policy of economic liberalization and deregulation or any social
or political uncertainties could adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Factors that may
adversely affect the Indian economy, and hence our results of operations, may include:
●the
macroeconomic climate, including any increase in Indian interest rates or inflation;
●any
exchange rate fluctuations, the imposition of currency controls and restrictions on the right
to convert or repatriate currency or export assets;
●any
scarcity of credit or other financing in India, resulting in an adverse effect on economic
conditions in India and scarcity of financing for our expansions;
●prevailing
income conditions among Indian customers and Indian corporations;
●epidemic,
pandemic or any other public health in India or in countries in the region or globally, including
in India’s various neighboring countries;
●volatility
in, and actual or perceived trends in trading activity on, India’s principal stock
exchanges;
●changes
in India’s tax, trade, fiscal or monetary policies;
●political
instability, terrorism or military conflict in India or in countries in the region or globally,
including in India’s various neighboring countries;
●occurrence
of natural or man-made disasters;
●prevailing
regional or global economic conditions, including in India’s principal export markets;
●other
significant regulatory or economic developments in or affecting India or its consumption
sector;
39
●international
business practices that may conflict with other customs or legal requirements to which we
are subject, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;
●protectionist
and other adverse public policies, including local content requirements, import/export tariffs,
increased regulations or capital investment requirements;
●logistical
and communications challenges;
●difficulty
in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable
terms or on a timely basis; and
●being
subject to the jurisdiction of foreign courts, including uncertainty of judicial processes
and difficulty enforcing contractual agreements or judgments in foreign legal systems or
incurring additional costs to do so.
Any
slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian economy, could adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition and the price of our ordinary shares.
The
impact of any changes to Indian legislation on our business cannot be fully determined at this time. Additionally, our business and financial
performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules
and regulations applicable to us and our business, including those relating to consumer protection and privacy. Such unfavorable changes
could decrease demand for our services and products, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.
Cross-border
transactions in India are subject to exchange control regulations of India.
In
India, transactions between residents and non-residents or transactions involving foreign currencies, such as foreign investment into
India, imports and exports of goods and services (including insurance tech licensing or related services), borrowings in foreign currencies,
incurrence of any liabilities in foreign currencies (such as non INR denominated guarantees) and overseas investments by resident Indians
are regulated by the foreign exchange regulations in India, including Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, each as amended from time to time (“FEMA”). FEMA has classified such transactions into two broad categories:
capital account transactions and current account transactions. Capital account transactions (transactions which alter the assets or liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, outside of India by persons residing in India or assets or liabilities, including contingent liabilities
in India by persons residing outside India) are generally prohibited unless specifically permitted under FEMA, and current account transactions
(transactions other than capital account transactions) are generally permitted unless prohibited or specifically regulated by FEMA. Accordingly,
investments that were made by a non-resident in Roadzen’s Indian subsidiaries/entities were subject to foreign exchange regulations,
which such entities were required under FEMA to report to the Reserve Bank of India. There have been certain lapses in reporting such
investments as required under FEMA, which are currently in the process of being regularized. While past lapses could be attributed to
technical lapses and human errors, we are setting up a system to track and monitor compliance with the regulatory requirements under
applicable laws. Currently, although there are no notices or penalty imposed by the Reserve Bank of India in respect of such lapses,
such lapses could result in actions by the Reserve Bank of India, potentially leading to penalties (including late submission fees) and
enforcement actions (including compounding process for regularization of the violation), which in extreme cases, among things, could
be up to three times the sum involved in such contravention that is the subject matter of violation of the regulatory requirements. In
determining the penalties, the discretion of the regulatory agencies in imposing penalties is generally guided by facts and circumstances
of a specific case, particularly, the gravity of the violation and the bona fide of the parties involved. While such violations can be
regularized under the applicable laws, there can be no assurance that the penalties imposed by the regulator while regularizing such
past lapses will not adversely affect our business or financial conditions.
The
Business Combination we closed may be scrutinized by the tax authorities in India.
Under
the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, as amended from time to time (“Income Tax Act”), income arising directly or indirectly through
the sale of a capital asset, including shares of a company incorporated outside of India, will be subject to tax in India, if such shares
derive, directly or indirectly, their value substantially from assets located in India, whether or not the seller of such shares has
a residence, place of business, business connection, or any other presence in India. Such capital asset (including shares) shall be deemed
to derive value substantially from assets located in India if, on the specified date, the value of the Indian assets exceeds the amount
of INR 100 million and the overseas company derives 50% or more of its overall value from the Indian assets. However, an exception is
available under the Income Tax Act for shareholders who (together with any of their associated enterprises, as defined under Income Tax
Act) neither hold more than 5% of voting power of the share capital in the company nor hold any right of management or control in the
company, at any time in the 12 months preceding the date of transfer. Similarly, the impact of the above indirect transfer provisions
would need to be separately evaluated under the tax treaty scenario of the country of which the shareholder is a tax resident.
40
If
the indirect transfer tax provisions are applicable, the Company may be required to withhold tax in respect of gains made by respective
transferors at the applicable rate and both transferor and the Company would have to undertake requisite compliances in India.
The
tax authorities in India may determine that we have a Place of Effective Management in India for a specific financial year or a permanent
establishment in India or business connection under the Indian tax regime, a finding of which would subject us to corporate taxation
in India.
We
face certain risks of being subject to corporate taxation in India. One such risk is that if Indian tax authorities determine that the
Place of Effective Management (“POEM”) for Roadzen is located in India, then its world-wide income will be taxed at 40% (plus
surcharge and cess) in India. The second risk is the risk of “permanent establishment,” which can arise when directors or
officers or agents of the company conduct business on behalf of the company while in India, or where an Indian subsidiary carries out
the business of its non-Indian parent. Such actions may subject the non-Indian entity’s income derived from the business conducted
in India or attributed to India, to being treated as “business income” by the Indian tax authorities and, accordingly, taxed
at 40% (plus surcharge and cess).
While
POEM provisions are described under the Indian domestic tax regime, “permanent establishment” concept and provisions are
generally contained under bilateral double taxation avoidance agreements (“International Tax Treaties”) that India has executed
with multiple countries globally. India does not have an international tax treaty with the British Virgin Islands, but it has an Agreement
for Exchange of Information with respect to taxes with the British Virgin Islands. However, the Income Tax Act contemplates a comparable
concept of “business connection,” which has a much wider scope of taxability than that of the permanent establishment under
an international tax treaty. Business connection is defined to include significant economic presence. A foreign enterprise may set up
a significant economic presence in India if (a) sales from transactions in goods, services or property with any person in India (including
provision of data or software downloads) during the tax year exceed INR 20 million (approximately USD 233,696 based on an exchange rate
of USD 1.00 = INR 85.5814 as of March 31, 2025, or (b) the Company engages in systematic and continuous soliciting of its business activities
or interacts with more than 300,000 Indian users. A significant economic presence may arise even if such foreign enterprise (i) has no
physical place of business or employees in India, (ii) does not render any services in India, and/or (c) does not enter into agreements
in India.
Under
Section 6 of the Income Tax Act, POEM is defined as “a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for
the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance, made.” The guidance for determining POEM sets forth certain
tests to determine if a company is engaged in active business outside India. The POEM of a company with active business outside India
is presumed to be outside India if the majority of its board meetings are held outside India in the relevant financial year, subject
to certain caveats contained in the circulars issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (“CBDT”), Ministry of Finance,
Government of India. If a company does not qualify as having active business outside India, there is a two-stage process for determining
its POEM. The first stage involves the determination of the people who make key management and commercial decisions for the business
of the company as a whole. The second stage involves a determination of the place where such decisions are in fact being made. To this
end, factors such as whether the company’s head office is located outside India, where the board of directors meets and makes decisions
and whether it delegates any of its authority to senior management for making commercial decisions related to the company, are relevant.
Additionally, Circular 8 of 2017 issued by the CBDT provides an exemption from POEM regulations to any company incorporated outside of
India with revenues of INR 500 million (approximately USD 5.8 million based on an exchange rate of USD 1.00 = INR 85.5814 as of March
31, 2025) or less in a given financial year.
If
it is determined by the Indian tax authorities that the Company will have a POEM in India, it will be subject to tax in India on our
global income and will be subject to all procedural requirements, including filing a tax return in India and complying with certain tax
withholding provisions. The applicable corporate tax rate for a domestic company is 22-30%, however, the Central Board of Direct Taxes,
Ministry of Finance, Government of India, prescribes that a foreign company that is deemed to have a POEM in India will be taxed at a
rate of 40% plus an applicable surcharge and cess (on tax). A surcharge of 2% of the income tax calculated will be applied if the Company’s
total income for any given year exceeds INR 10 million (approximately USD 116,848 based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2025) but
is less than INR 100 million (approximately USD 1.2 million based on the exchange rate as of March 31, 2025), and a surcharge of 5% of
the income tax calculated will be applied if the Company’s total income exceeds INR 100 million. Additionally, a health and education
cess equal to 4% of income tax as increased by surcharge calculated will be levied).
41
Alternatively,
if business activities carried out in India by certain persons in their capacity as directors or officers or agents of the Company, the
Company may be determined by the Indian tax authorities to have a business connection in India under the Income Tax Act. Each of Mr.
Rohan Malhotra, who serves as a director and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Ankur Kamboj, who serves as Roadzen’s
Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Saurav Adhikari, who serves as a director of Roadzen, is an Indian citizen and either resides or spends
a portion of his time every year in India. Their actions in India on behalf of Roadzen, taken as a whole, may lead Indian tax authorities
to determine that Roadzen has a business connection in India. Such a determination may result in taxation of Roadzen’s income,
which is attributable to operations carried on in India, at 40% plus the applicable surcharge and cess.
Accordingly,
a finding by the Indian tax authorities that the Company has a POEM or a business connection in India under the Income Tax Act could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Additionally,
some of our subsidiaries are already subject to corporate taxes in India and some are not. If any of our non-Indian subsidiaries conducts
business or provides services in India, or an individual has the authority to enter into and execute contracts on behalf of such non-Indian
subsidiary, and such activities take place in India but do not fall within an exclusion available under the relevant Double Tax Avoidance
Agreement between India and the jurisdiction of incorporation of the non-Indian subsidiary, the non-Indian subsidiary’s income
from such activities would be taxable in India.
Additional
Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares
Nasdaq
may delist the Company’s securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions
in its securities and subject the Company to additional trading restrictions.
Currently,
our ordinary shares are publicly traded on The Nasdaq Global Market. We cannot assure you that our ordinary shares will continue to be
listed on The Nasdaq Global Market. In order to continue listing our securities on The Nasdaq Global Market, we will be required to maintain
Continued Listing Requirements as per Rule 5450, including, certain financial, distribution and share price levels, among others.
If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and the Company is not able to list its securities on another national securities
exchange, we expect that the securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant
material adverse consequences, including:
●a
limited availability of market quotations for such securities;
●reduced
liquidity for such securities;
●a
determination that our ordinary shares is a “penny stock” which will require
brokers trading in our ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result
in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
●a
limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
●a
decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the
sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Since our securities are listed on Nasdaq, they
are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of its securities, the federal statute does allow
the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states
can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.
Our
share price may change significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.
The
trading price of our ordinary shares is likely to be volatile. The stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility. This volatility
often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. You may not be able to resell your
shares at an attractive price due to a number of factors such as those listed in “Risks Relating to Roadzen’s Business and
Industry” and the following:
●results
of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
●results
of operations that vary from those of our competitors;
●the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business and financial conditions;
●changes
in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and
investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;
42
●declines
in the market prices of stocks generally;
●strategic
actions by the Company or its competitors;
●announcements
by the Company or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures,
other strategic relationships or capital commitments;
●any
significant change in the Company’s management;
●changes
in general economic or market conditions or trends in the Company’s industry or markets;
●changes
in business or regulatory conditions, including new laws or regulations or new interpretations
of existing laws or regulations applicable to the Company’s business;
●future
sales of the Company’s ordinary shares or other securities;
●investor
perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with the Company’s ordinary shares
relative to other investment alternatives;
●the
public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by the Company or
third parties, including the Company’s filings with the SEC;
●litigation
involving the Company, the Company’s industry, or both, or investigations by regulators
into the Company’s operations or those of the Company’s competitors;
●guidance,
if any, that the Company provides to the public, any changes in this guidance or the Company’s
failure to meet this guidance;
●the
development and sustainability of an active trading market for the Company’s share;
●actions
by institutional or activist shareholders;
●changes
in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; and
●other
events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism
or responses to these events.
These
broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our actual operating
performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our ordinary shares is low.
In
the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If the Company was
involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from
the Company’s business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.
Because
there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on
investment unless you sell your ordinary shares for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
The
Company intends to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans
to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on our ordinary shares
will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s board of directors. The Company’s board of directors may take into account
general and economic conditions, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, the Company’s available cash
and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, implications on the
payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by its subsidiaries to it and such other factors as the Company’s board
of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of Roadzen’s
existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness the Company incurs. As a result, you
may not receive any return on an investment in our ordinary shares unless you sell our ordinary shares for a price greater than that
which you paid for it.
43
If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about
the Company’s business or if they downgrade the Company’s share or the Company’s sector, the Company’s share
price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for the Company’s ordinary
shares will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about the Company or its business. The
Company will not control these analysts. In addition, some financial analysts may have limited expertise with the Company’s model
and operations. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover the Company downgrade its shares or industry, or the shares
of any of its competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about its business, the price of our shares could decline. If
one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on it regularly, the Company could lose visibility
in the market, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.
Future issuances of debt securities and equity securities may
adversely affect the Company, including the market price of our ordinary shares, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.
There is no assurance that the
Company will not incur debt or issue equity ranking senior to its ordinary shares. Those securities will generally have priority upon
liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting its operating
flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that the Company issues in the future may have rights, preferences
and privileges more favorable than those of its ordinary shares. Because the Company’s decision to issue debt or equity in the
future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control, it cannot predict or estimate the amount,
timing, nature or success of the Company’s future capital raising efforts. The amount of ordinary shares issued in connection with
an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the Company’s then-outstanding shares of ordinary shares. Any
issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to the Company’s
shareholders. As a result, future capital-raising efforts may reduce the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and be dilutive
to existing shareholders.
Anti-takeover provisions in the Company’s organizational
documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
The BVI Companies Act does not currently provide
anti-takeover measures, similar to some jurisdictions in the U.S.
Certain provisions of the
Company’s memorandum and articles of association (the “Memorandum and Articles of Association”) may have an anti-takeover
effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that
a shareholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for
the shares held by the Company’s shareholders.
These provisions, among other things:
●authorize the Company’s board of directors to issue preference
shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges
and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders;
●limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general
meetings of shareholders;
●require advance notice procedures
with which shareholders must comply to nominate candidates to the Company’s board of
directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a shareholders’ meeting, which
could preclude shareholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings and delay
changes in the Company’s board of directors and also may discourage or deter a potential
acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate
of directors or otherwise from attempting to obtain control of the Company;
●provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only
upon the unanimous approval of all other directors then in office or shareholders representing
at least two-thirds (2/3) of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting for the election of
directors; and
●permit the Company’s board of directors to fill vacancies
created by the expansion of the Company’s board of directors or the resignation, death
or removal of a director.
44
Roadzen is a BVI company and, because judicial precedent regarding
the rights of members is more limited under BVI law than that under U.S. law, you may have less protection for your member rights than
you would under U.S. law.
Our corporate affairs will be governed by the
Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended and restated from time to time, the BVI Companies Act and the common law of the BVI.
The rights of members to take action against the directors, actions by minority members and the fiduciary responsibilities of the Company’s
directors to the Company under BVI law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the BVI. The common law of the BVI is derived
in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the BVI as well as that from English common law, which has persuasive, but not
binding, authority on a court in the BVI. The rights of the Company’s members and the fiduciary responsibilities of its directors
under BVI law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the U.S.
In particular, the BVI has a less exhaustive body of securities laws than the U.S. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have
more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the BVI. There is no statutory recognition in the BVI of
judgments obtained in the U.S., although the courts of the BVI will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment
of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. As a result of all of the above, public members may have
more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling
members than they would as members of a U.S. public company.
It may be difficult for you to enforce any judgment obtained
in the United States against us, our directors or executive officers or our affiliates.
India has reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters with only a limited number of jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom; however, no reciprocity
has been established with the U.S. In order to be enforceable, a judgment from a jurisdiction with reciprocity must meet certain requirements
of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended from time to time (the “Civil Code”). The Civil Code only permits
the enforcement and execution of monetary decrees in the reciprocating jurisdiction, not being in the nature of any amounts payable in
respect of taxes, other charges, fines or penalties. Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions which do not have reciprocal recognition
with India may be enforced in India only by a fresh suit upon the foreign judgment and not by proceedings in execution. The suit must
be brought in India within three (3) years from the date of judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability
in India. Generally, there are considerable delays in the disposal of suits by Indian courts. It is unlikely that a court in India would
award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action were to be brought in India. Furthermore, it is unlikely that an Indian
court would enforce foreign judgments if that court was of the view that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or inconsistent
with Indian practice. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including remedies available under the U.S. federal
securities laws, may not be allowed in Indian courts if contrary to public policy in India. A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment
in India is required to obtain prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India to repatriate any amount recovered. Any judgment in a foreign
currency would be converted into Indian Rupees on the date of the judgment and not on the date of the payment. We cannot predict whether
a suit brought in an Indian court will be disposed of in a timely manner or be subject to considerable delays.
Because we are incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin
Islands, shareholders may face difficulties in effecting service of legal process, protecting their interests, and their ability to protect
their rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited.
We are incorporated under the laws of the British
Virgin Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company’s
directors or officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against the Company’s directors or officers.
The Company is a British Virgin Islands company
and substantially a majority of its assets are located outside of the U.S. A majority of its current operations are conducted in Europe
and India. In addition, some of its directors and officers reside outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect
service of process within the U.S. or elsewhere upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in Europe, India or British
Virgin Islands courts judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against
the Company and its officers and directors, and the majority of whose assets are located outside of the U.S. It may be difficult or impossible
for you to bring an action against the Company in the British Virgin Islands if you believe your rights under the U.S. securities laws
have been infringed. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the British Virgin Islands, Europe or India would
recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against the Company or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the U.S. or any state, and it is uncertain whether such British Virgin Islands, European or Indian courts would hear
original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, Europe or India against the Company or such persons predicated upon the securities
laws of the U.S. or any state.
There is no statutory recognition in the British
Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will in certain circumstances
recognize such a foreign judgment and treat it as a cause of action in itself which may be sued upon as a debt at common law so that
no retrial of the issues would be necessary provided that the U.S. judgment:
●the U.S. court issuing the judgment had jurisdiction in the matter
and the Company either submitted to such jurisdiction or was resident or carrying on business
within such jurisdiction and was duly served with process;
●is final and for a liquidated sum;
●the judgment given by the U.S. court was not in respect of penalties,
taxes, fines or similar fiscal or revenue obligations of the Company;
●in obtaining judgment there was no fraud on the part of the person
in whose favor judgment was given or on the part of the court;
45
●recognition or enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary
to public policy in the British Virgin Islands; and
●the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were not
contrary to natural justice.
The courts of the British Virgin Islands are also
unlikely:
●to recognize or enforce against the Company judgments of courts
of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws
where that liability is in respect of penalties, taxes, fines or similar fiscal or revenue
obligations of the Company; and
●to impose liabilities against the Company, in original actions
brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S.
securities laws that are penal in nature.
As a result of all of the above, public shareholders
may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors
or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.
Handling of mail
Mail addressed to the Company and received at
its registered office will be forwarded unopened to the forwarding address supplied by Company to be dealt with. None of the Company,
its directors, officers, advisors or service providers (including the organization which provides registered office services in the BVI)
will bear any responsibility for any delay howsoever caused in mail reaching the forwarding address.
The Company may be subject to securities litigation, which is
expensive and could divert management attention.
The market price of our ordinary shares may be
volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities
class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against the Company
could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm its
business.
Risks Relating Our Ordinary Shares
We are subject to increased costs as a result of operating as
a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
As a public company, we incur significant legal,
accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global
Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment
and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance
and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in
these areas, such as “say on pay” and proxy access. Emerging growth companies may implement many of these requirements over
a longer period of up to five years from the pricing of this offering. We intend to take advantage of these extended transition periods
but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected
expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory
reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the
manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.
The rules and regulations applicable to public
companies have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income and may require
us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations
made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial
costs in the future to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs
we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.
46
If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal
controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders
could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our ordinary shares.
Effective internal controls are necessary for
us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and
maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and
reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any
failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls,
could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause
investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of
our ordinary shares.
Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect
all errors or acts of fraud.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or
by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements, or
insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our shareholders,
including purchasers of ordinary shares in this offering.
To the extent that we raise additional capital
through the sale of ordinary shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into ordinary shares, your ownership interest will be diluted,
and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect your rights as a shareholder
of ordinary shares. Debt financing, if available, would increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include
covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures
or declaring dividends.
We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company,
and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies
will make our ordinary shares less attractive to investors.
We are an emerging growth company, as defined
in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company,
we intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to, exemption from auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced executive compensation disclosure obligations, in this Annual Report, our periodic reports and our
proxy statements, and an exemption from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation, and stockholder
approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following
the year in which we complete this offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion
or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering;
(iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period; or (iv) the date
on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies
can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected
to not “opt out” of this exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will adopt
new or revised accounting standards at the time private companies adopt the new or revised accounting standard and will do so until such
time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an
emerging growth company. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting
company,” which would allow us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements and reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements.
47
We cannot predict if investors will find our ordinary
shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares less attractive as a result,
there may be a less active trading market for our ordinary shares and our stock price may be more volatile.
Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our
capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our
capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business.
As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our ordinary shares will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.
Our actual financial results may differ materially from any
guidance we may publish from time to time.
We may, from time to time, provide guidance regarding
our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date such guidance is provided. Any such guidance would
be based upon a number of assumptions with respect to future business decisions (some of which may change) and estimates, while presented
with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies
(many of which are beyond our control). Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all the assumptions
that inform such guidance will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Our ability to meet any forward-looking
guidance is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, other risks to our business described in this “Risk
Factors” section. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date such guidance
is provided. Actual results may vary from such guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize the reliability
of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther into the future the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors should
not place undue reliance on our financial guidance and should carefully consider any guidance we may publish in context.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
Risk Management and Strategy
We have risk management processes in place for
identifying, assessing and mitigating cybersecurity and risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our electronic information
systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or the information residing
on those systems. These include a wide variety of mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems and other processes that are designed
to detect, prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, interference with operations, or other security incidents
or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data includes confidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect,
process, store, and transmit as part of our business, including on behalf of third parties. Cybersecurity concerns are an important consideration
in our application development and the design of our infrastructure and operations technology. We also use systems and processes designed
to reduce the impact of a security incident to our clients or their customers. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify
material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems
that we use for encryption and authentication, employee email, communication to clients and their customers, operational support, and
other functions.
Governance
Our executive leadership team is responsible for
our overall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of other material
risks to the Company. As part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams are responsible to track and
log privacy and security incidents across Roadzen platforms and our vendors and other third-party service providers to remediate and
resolve any incidents, should they arise. In case there are any incidents, it is promptly reviewed by a cross-functional working group
to determine whether further escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material shall
be immediately escalated for further assessment, and shall be reported to designated members of our senior management. We consult with
our counsels as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior management makes the final materiality
determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions.
48
Our corporate governance committee has oversight
responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation
with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other risks, and the committee is responsible to report any findings and recommendations,
as appropriate, to the full board for consideration. Senior management regularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should any issues
arise, they review all material incidents with the corporate governance committee. Our corporate governance and audit committees discuss
policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including risks associated with the reliability and security of the Company’s
information technology and security systems, and the steps management has undertaken to monitor and control such exposures. Our board
receives updates on the Company’s cybersecurity risk management programs from management.
Our business strategy, results of operations and
financial condition have not been affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, however, we cannot provide assurance that they will not
be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity related
risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors under “Our solutions or products or our third-party cloud providers have experienced in the past,
and could experience in the future, data security breaches, which could adversely impact our reputation, business, and ongoing operations”.
Item 2. Properties.
Our principal executive offices in the U.S., which
we lease, are located at 111 Anza Blvd., Suite 109 Burlingame, CA 94010. Additionally we lease office space in Coventry in the U.K. as
well as in Ahmedabad, Chennai and New Delhi in India. The Company does not own any real estate. We believe that our existing office space
is sufficient for our current needs.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, we may be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
On April 17, 2025, Roadzen filed a lawsuit in
Palm Beach County, Florida against Meteora Capital Partners, LP and affiliated entities (“Meteora”), alleging willful breach
of contract and conduct that has damaged Roadzen and its public market value. The lawsuit stems from a Forward Purchase Agreement (the
“FPA”) signed in August 2023, under which Meteora agreed to acquire 5 million shares in Roadzen at effectively a zero-cost
basis and to remit proceeds from the sale of those shares to Roadzen under certain contractual mechanisms. Roadzen alleges that, despite
negotiated safeguards, Meteora sold Roadzen shares without honoring its payment obligations or providing the required notices
under the FPA. Roadzen is pursuing a contractual claim plus additional damages. The lawsuit is pending
in Palm Beach County, Florida.
On
April 18, 2025, Meteora filed a separate lawsuit against the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, also arising
out of the FPA and the subscription agreement, dated August 25, 2023, between the Company and Meteora (the “Subscription Agreement”).
In its complaint, among other things, Meteora alleges breach of contract by the Company based on the Company’s registration obligations
under the Subscription Agreement and seeks specific performance and damages, as well as declaratory judgment that (i) Meteora complied
with its obligations under the FPA and Subscription Agreement, (ii) the Company breached certain of its registration obligations under
the Subscription Agreement and (iii) Meteora’s obligations to the Company under the FPA are limited to $914,726.53.
On
May 23, 2025, the Company removed the pending action to the District Court for the District of Delaware. Thereafter, on June 3, 2025,
Meteora moved to remand the action back to the Court of Chancery, and subsequently sought default judgment against the Company in the
District Court.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
Throughout this section, references to “Roadzen,”
“we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Roadzen after the Business Combination, and Roadzen (DE) before the
Business Combination, and their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context so requires. The following discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations of Roadzen Inc. and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors, including those set forth or referred to under the section titled “Risk Factors” or elsewhere in this
Annual Report.
Overview
Roadzen is a leading Insurtech company on a mission
to transform global auto insurance powered by advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the heart of our mission is our commitment
to create transparency, efficiency, and a seamless experience for the millions of end customers who use our products through our insurer,
OEM, and fleet (such as trucking, delivery, and commercial fleets) partners. We seek to accomplish this by combining computer vision,
telematics and AI with continually updated data sources to provide a more efficient, effective and informed way of building auto insurance
products, assessing damages, processing claims and improving driver safety. Insurers and other partners of Roadzen across the world use
Roadzen’s technology to launch new auto insurance products, manage risk better and resolve claims faster. These products are built
with dynamic underwriting capabilities, Application Programming Interface, or API-led distribution and real-time claims processing.
Roadzen has built a pioneering technology platform
that uses telematics, computer vision and data science to spearhead innovation across the insurance value chain, namely underwriting,
distribution, claims and road safety. We call it the Roadzen “Insurance as a Service” (“IaaS”) platform. Our
business generates commission-based revenue as an insurance broker focused on embedded and B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Customer) insurance
distribution, and fee-based revenue as a provider of innovative cloud, telematics, and AI-based applications for the auto insurance ecosystem.
Roadzen has four major client types:
●Insurance — including insurance companies, reinsurers, agents,
brokers;
●Automotive — including carmakers, dealerships, online-to-offline
car sales platforms;
●Fleets — including small and medium fleets, taxi fleets,
ridesharing platforms, commercial and corporate fleets; and
●Other distribution channels such as financial services companies
providing auto loans, and telematics companies.
Our operations are global, and our partners consist of market-leading insurance companies, fleets and automotive original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) and carmakers, including AXA, SCOR, Arch, Société Générale, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi, Mercedes, Volvo
and several others. Our subsidiary in the U.K., operates through a specialist Managing General Agent (“MGA”) based in Coventry,
which provides auto insurance, extended warranties, and claims management services to insurers, automotive dealers, manufacturers, and
fleet operators. This MGA leverages its regulatory license to underwrite and service policies locally while utilizing third-party licenses
to deliver solutions globally. It acts as a delegated authority on behalf of insurers, managing policy sales and claims adjudication via
its brokerage platform. Revenue is generated through commissions and administrative fees tied to Gross Written Premium (“GWP”),
with specialty contracts typically structured over five-year terms. Roadzen’s subsidiary in the U.S., operates a licensed auto club
based in Burlingame, California that specializes in commercial roadside assistance (“RSA”) and claims management. With a robust
network of over 75,000 service providers nationwide, it offers towing, transportation, and first notice of loss (“FNOL”) services
to government fleets, enterprises, insurers, and auto manufacturers. These capabilities support our comprehensive suite of mobility and
insurance infrastructure services across North America. Roadzen’s subsidiary in India operates as a licensed insurance broker providing
distribution and servicing of motor insurance products, including RSA, vehicle inspection, and claim facilitation. Our India operations
also serve as the company’s global technology headquarters, where our product, engineering, and AI teams develop and scale the core platforms
that power our insurance and mobility services worldwide. This integrated approach allows us to drive innovation and operational efficiency
across all markets we serve.
Roadzen’s AI Manifesto
Our mission is to build the leading company at
the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), insurance and mobility. To further our mission, we have built a pioneering lab focused
on fundamental and applied AI research. We work on core research areas in computer vision, generative AI, and traditional machine learning
to develop product experiences that improve the safety, convenience, and protection of millions of drivers across the world. Roadzen
is a founding member of the AI Alliance fostering safe, responsible, and open source development alongside industry leaders such as Meta,
IBM, Hugging Face, Stability AI, AMD, Service Now, and others. Our approach to build precision AI models in insurance and mobility has
won several industry accolades. Roadzen achieved significant industry recognition for its advancements in AI and technology during FY 2024-25. Honors
included ‘Best AI in Deep Tech’ at the AI Awards Summit 2025 by Entrepreneur India and secured a spot on the Fintech40 Index
by L’Observatoire de la Fintech. It was named the ‘World’s Top InsurTech’ by CNBC in 2024, ‘Most Innovative
Use of AI’ by Financial Express at the FE Futech Awards 2024 and won the Gold Stevie Award for its xClaim insurance solution at
the International Business Awards 2024. Additional recognitions included ‘Excellence in InsurTech’ by the India FinTech Forum
(IFTA 2024), ‘Best Use of AI in Insurance’ at the Global AI Summit & Awards (GAISA 2024), and ‘Best Product and
Business Team’ at the World Auto Forum 2024. Roadzen also won ‘Best Use of Technology’ at the Entrepreneur Awards 2024
and ‘Most Innovative Company’ at the World Finance Innovation Awards 2024.
51
On September 20, 2023, the Parent Company completed
the Business Combination in which it acquired Roadzen (DE). Roadzen (DE) was determined to be the accounting acquiror in the Business
Combination. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined
company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i)
the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Parent Company and
Roadzen (DE) following the Closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical
cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.
Our Business Model
Roadzen has two principal models for generating
revenue: 1) Income from Insurance as a Service (IaaS Platform), and 2) Commission and Distribution Income (Brokerage Solutions). We follow a capital-light business model, meaning
that we do not underwrite any risk ourselves or carry it on our balance sheet for either source of revenue.
1.IaaS Platform:
Roadzen provides an IaaS technology platform addressed
towards insurance for mobility. The IaaS platform has a suite of products that work cohesively to address the auto insurance value chain.
Roadzen sells its IaaS platform to insurers, car manufacturers, and fleet companies to deliver services for their respective insured
customers. Our deep understanding of the insurance industry has enabled us to develop a unified suite of modules and products that is
tailored to address the key challenges faced in auto insurance. Our solution suite includes several products that support the insurance
lifecycle, such as:
●Via: enables fleets, carmakers and insurers to inspect
a vehicle using computer vision;
●Global Distribution Network (“GDN”): enables
the configuration, customer quote, payment (in any currency), and administration of any insurance
policy with any insurance carrier as the underwriter:
●xClaim: enables digital, touchless and real-time resolution
of claims from FNOL through payment, using telematics and computer vision;
●StrandD: enables digital, real-time dispatch and tracking
for RSA and FNOL during accident claims;
●Good Driving: enables insurers and fleets to recognize
their best drivers, train poor drivers and build usage-based insurance (“UBI”)
programs; and
●DrivebuddyAI: enables any vehicle to get advanced driver-assistance
capabilities utilizing cameras and neural networks to deliver better safety on the road.
●MixtapeAI: a platform designed to power AI agents and transform
customer interactions in the insurance and mobility sectors.
Our technology revolutionizes the customer experience
by helping customers obtain a policy within seconds and process a claim estimate within minutes in comparison with existing processes
that can take weeks. Roadzen’s revenue derived from platform sales is usage-based, meaning we get paid on a per-vehicle or per-use
basis.
Roadzen’s IaaS Platform accounted for
approximately 47% of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025.
2.Brokerage Solutions:
Roadzen acts as an insurance broker utilizing
its technology to sell insurance through our embedded and B2B2C distribution model. The policies are sold by insurance intermediaries
such as agents and through captive distributors such as dealerships, fleets and used car platforms. Our B2B2C channel partners choose
us for a variety of reasons - for the ease of integrating our technology through APIs into their ecosystem, for a seamless, fully digital
customer experience from obtaining a policy to submitting a claim, and for integrations with a large number of insurance companies who
sell their policies through our platform to give the users a handful of policy options, and our ability to deliver multiple relevant
products such as auto insurance, commercial and fleet insurance, extended warranty, guaranteed asset protection, and other automotive
related insurance products. Lastly, we are able to provide a superior customer experience for the end user by bundling telematics for
road safety, RSA and claims management to the customer - an experience that we believe is unrivaled by other traditional brokers. Roadzen’s
revenues are based on commissions and other fees that are paid by our insurance carriers as a percentage of the GWP underwritten for
each policy.
52
Roadzen’s Brokerage Solutions accounted
for approximately 53% of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2025.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our financial condition and results of operations
have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following:
Investment in Core Technology and AI
We continue to develop and invest in our technology
platform to drive scalability and build innovative products. We believe our significant proprietary investments into our data pipelines,
training, model development and our core technology platform are key advantages that allow us to stay ahead of competition, support our
growth into global markets and improve operating margins.
Investment in Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are a key component
of our growth strategy. Our investments in this area have enabled us to build and sustain our customer base while creating long-term
customer relationships. Our sales efforts are materially dependent on our three different channels: (1) strategic sales to insurers and
car companies; (2) sales to small-and-medium fleet owners; and (3) brokerage sales driven by agents, captive distribution channels and
reinsurance partnerships. We plan to continue investing in each of these channels of growth including hiring sales personnel, event marketing
and global travel.
Investments in Innovation for Future Growth
The world of mobility is changing rapidly due
to advances in connected, electric, and autonomous vehicles. We believe this presents an exciting and large opportunity to build insurance
for this evolving environment. For this reason, our performance will be impacted by our ability to continuously innovate our underwriting
algorithms, internalize new data sources and technologies such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) and video
telematics for accident prevention, and invest in partnerships with carmakers for their insurance offerings and for selling insurance
into fleets.
Acquiring New Customers
Our long-term growth will depend on our continued
ability to attract new customers to our platform. We intend to continue to drive customers to our platform by expanding our B2B2C model
through different avenues.
●In addition to our existing geographic and product footprint,
we aim to grow by expanding into new markets across our target geographies, leveraging our
technology platform to increase our speed to market.
●We intend to consistently offer cutting edge technology at the
intersection of mobility and insurance - a capability that traditional insurance carriers
and other insurance intermediaries have struggled to provide. As our clients look to digitize
and capture a greater part of the insurance value chain, our technology is the differentiator
for them to choose Roadzen as a partner.
Expanding Sales Within Our Existing Customer Base
A central part of our strategy is expanding solutions
adoption across our existing customer base. We have developed long-term relationships with our customers and have a proven track record
of successfully cross-selling product offerings. We have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality
to customers that do not currently utilize our full solution portfolio from our platform. As we innovate and bring new technology and
solutions to market, we also have the opportunity to realize incremental growth by selling new products to our existing customer base.
Our ability to expand sales within our customer
base will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction, pricing, competition, and changes in our customers’
spending levels. Roadzen’s customers include leading insurers and car companies that have a global presence and are spending millions
of dollars on digitizing their insurance offerings. We believe that successful integration in one geography may open up opportunities
within other geographies. Roadzen has shown the ability to expand contracts from low ticket size in India to higher ticket size in global
markets. We have a significant focus on maximizing the lifetime value of our customer relationships, and we continue to make significant
investments in order to grow our customer base.
53
Since January 1, 2023 we began tracking customer
segmentation for Roadzen, described as such: enterprise clients that include insurers, automakers and large fleets (above 100 vehicles),
and SMB clients, which include agents, brokers, small dealerships, and small fleets (under 100 vehicles). As of March 31, 2025, we had
34 insurance customer agreements (including carriers, self-insureds and other entities processing insurance claims), 78 automotive customer
agreements, and approximately 3,800 agents and fleet customers agreements.
Strength of the Auto Insurance Market
We generate a majority of
our revenues through commissions and fees which are a reflection of the total insurance policy premium. Roadzen derived 53% of revenue
from its Brokerage Solutions and 47% from its IaaS Platform for the year ended March 31, 2025. A softening of the
insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates due to competition or regulation could negatively impact our financial
results.
Our Regulatory Environment
Our insurance broking business is subject to various
laws and regulations and our inability to comply with them may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and reputation.
Our subsidiary in India is licensed to act as
a direct insurance broker (life and general) under the Insurance Brokers Regulations of India. Accordingly, we are subject to certain
laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Insurance brokers operating in India are required to comply with various regulatory requirements,
including stipulations that: (i) the principal officer and broker qualified persons of an insurance broker must undergo training and
pass the relevant examinations specified by the IRDAI; (ii) the principal officer, directors, shareholders and key management personnel
must fulfill the “fit and proper” criteria specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; (iii) insurance brokers may
not undertake multi-level marketing for solicitation and procuring of insurance products; (iv) insurance brokers may not offer any rebate
or any other inducement to a client; (v) insurance brokers must conduct their business in compliance with the code of conduct specified
under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; and (vi) insurance brokers must ensure that not more than 50% of their remuneration emanates
from one client in a financial year. The IRDAI may undertake inspection of the premises of an insurance broker to ascertain how activities
are carried on, and inspect their books of accounts, records and documents. The Insurance Brokers Regulations specify certain approval
and reporting requirements to be adhered to by the insurance brokers from time to time, as applicable. We would be subject to fines and
penalties if we fail to comply with the Insurance Brokers Regulations. We derive revenues primarily from commissions and other fees paid
by insurance carriers for insurance products purchased by our customers.
The commissions that we can charge to our insurer
partners are based on charges set forth under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission or Remuneration or Reward to Insurance Agents and Insurance
Intermediaries) Regulations, 2016 (“IRDAI Commissions Regulations”). The IRDAI (Minimum Information Required for Investigation
and Inspection) Regulations, 2020 (“Minimum Information Regulations”), effective from May 23, 2021, are applicable to all
insurers and insurance intermediaries in relation to purposes of investigation and inspection by the IRDAI.
Inter-related companies within the group are subject
to a stringent regulatory framework that affects the flexibility of our operations and increases compliance costs, and any regulatory
action against us and our employees may result in penalties and/or sanctions that could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.
The regulatory and policy environment in which
we operate is evolving and is subject to change. The government of India (“GoI”) may implement new laws or other regulations
and policies that could affect the fintech industry, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us to obtain
approvals and licenses from the GoI and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous requirements. New compliance requirements could increase
our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our subsidiary in the U.K. is licensed as a MGA,
under which we are subject to stringent oversight by the FCA. Our operations must align with FCA regulations that are specifically tailored
to govern the conduct and obligations of MGAs, which act as an intermediary between insurers and clients, with delegated authority to
underwrite and process claims on behalf of insurers. Our adherence to these regulations encompasses a variety of compliance obligations,
including but not limited to, ensuring that underwriting decisions are made with the requisite skill and care, maintaining accurate and
secure records of insurance contracts, managing potential conflicts of interest, and safeguarding client funds. The FCA also imposes
comprehensive conduct rules and solvency requirements that require us to act with due care in the interests of policyholders.
54
The FCA’s regime for MGAs mandates a high
level of financial prudence and transparency, necessitating robust internal controls and reporting systems. Failure to meet these stringent
regulatory requirements could result in significant sanctions, including financial penalties, suspension of authorization, or other disciplinary
actions. Given the evolving nature of the regulatory environment, changes in the FCA’s rules or the introduction of new legislation
could necessitate adjustments to our operational and compliance processes. These changes could carry implications for our business model
and may incur additional compliance costs, ultimately impacting our financial results and operational flexibility.
Roadzen is committed to maintaining a rigorous
compliance posture to meet the FCA’s expectations for MGAs. Any lapse in our compliance framework could lead to regulatory scrutiny,
damage our reputation, and negatively affect our business operations and financial position. It is imperative for us to continuously
monitor regulatory developments and adapt our compliance measures accordingly to mitigate the risk of enforcement actions and to uphold
the trust of our clients and partners.
The FCA has the
authority to suspend the sale of any insurance product sold within the U.K. and for which it has oversight, if it does not believe a
firm or a product is protecting the interests of U.K. consumers. Effective February 2024, the FCA paused all sales of the Guaranteed
Asset Protection (“GAP”) product, a key contributor to our operations in the U.K., directing all insurers, including our
insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product. The regulator mandated insurers to make a resubmission, or new GAP
proposal, outlining product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product could be
resumed.
Although our insurance partner, which is obligated to adhere
to FCA guidelines, received approval to sell GAP products, the resubmission and approval process had a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall profitability.
Our subsidiary in the U.S. is licensed as an auto
club in California, which exposes Roadzen to a distinct set of risks due to the stringent regulatory landscape enforced by the California
Department of Insurance (“CDI”). Compliance with these regulations is paramount, as they govern a wide spectrum of our activities,
including membership services, claims management, and financial integrity.
Our Ability to Manage Risk with Data and Technology
Our operations are highly dependent on the reliability,
availability, and security of our technology platform and data. Our operations rely on the secure processing and storage of confidential
information, including our information systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers. Disruptions in the technology
platform, systems and control failures, security breaches, or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in legal exposure, harm
our reputation and brand, and ultimately affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Although we have implemented administrative
and technical controls and have taken protective actions to reduce risk, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized and
malicious attacks. As our technology-enabled platform is reliant on data from external parties, such attacks or disruption in our data
sources can impact our ability to operate effectively and result in damage to our reputation and results.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We provide access to our IaaS solutions through
contractual agreements with our customers, whereby the customer receives one or a bundle of our solutions, which can include inspection,
claims management, RSA, and/or telematics offerings. The average contract length for our IaaS customers is approximately three years.
Our clients pay us on a fixed fee per-incident or per-vehicle. Our brokerage revenues are based on commissions and fees that we receive
from our insurance partners for selling their policies to customers as well as providing other client services such as claims management.
Our commissions and fees are calculated as a percentage of the GWP underwritten for each policy.
55
Cost of Services
The cost of services for distribution business
includes commissions paid to the point-of-sale person, cost of employees and other direct expenses related to facilities.
For our IaaS platform, cost of services primarily
consists of direct costs involved in delivering the services to the customers, including external provider cost for inspections and RSA,
as well as additional costs such as employee benefit expenses. Costs forming part of cost of revenue are recognized as incurred.
Research and Development
Research and development costs consist primarily
of employee-related costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and other expenses. It also includes the cost
of annotating data pipelines for AI, the cost of building and maintaining our own AI servers for training and the cloud costs for production
deployments. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily include
expenditures related to advertising, channel partner incentives, media, promotional and bundling costs, brand awareness activities, business
development, corporate partnerships and allocated overhead costs. These expenses are a reflection of our efforts to expand our market
reach for distributing insurance policies. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of employee-related costs directly associated with
our sales and marketing activities, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits.
We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing
to grow our customer base and increase the awareness of end customers about our products. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing
expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. While we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as
a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period
to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of
employee-related costs for executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT, and facilities personnel, including salaries, stock-based
compensation, employee benefits, professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and allocated overhead
costs.
We expect our general and administrative expenses
to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth as well as due to additional costs associated
with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs as we operate as a public company. While we expect
our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our general and administrative
expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization reflects the recognition
of the cost of our tangible and intangible assets over their useful life. Depreciation expenses relate to equipment, hardware and purchased
software. Amortization relates to investments related to recent acquisitions, internal software development and investments made in intellectual
property development. Depreciation and amortization are expected to increase slightly in dollar amount over time but will likely decrease
as a percentage of revenue as investments in platform technology reach scale.
Fair Value Changes in Financial Instruments Carried at Fair
Value
Our outstanding notes and warrants are financial
liabilities measured at fair value with fair value changes recognized in profit or loss. We carry out a periodic fair valuation exercise
and recognize the increase or decrease in the carrying values of these financial instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Such fair value changes are primarily driven by changes in our equity value, risk free interest rates and credit risk premia.
56
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with definite life
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles can arise
from various factors, including economic fluctuations, industry changes, technological advancements, and evolving customer preferences.
When the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, impairment occurs, leading to a decrease in reported value
on our financial statements. Recognizing and addressing impairment in a timely and effective manner is essential. Regular assessments
and impairment tests are necessary to identify potential impairments and determine the recoverable amount of these assets.
Income Tax Expense/(Benefit)
Income tax expense/(benefit) consists primarily
of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against
our U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions’ deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Revenue declined by $2.4 million, representing
a 5% decrease for the year ending March 31, 2025, compared to the previous year. This reduction was primarily due to the suspension of
the GAP product in the U.K.
Commission and
Distribution Income saw a decrease of $7.0 million, or 23%, over the same period last year. This drop can be attributed to the suspension of
the GAP product in the U.K., which took effect in February 2024, offset by growth in other geographies.
Conversely, revenue from the Insurance as a Service
(IaaS) platform experienced significant growth, increasing by $4.6 million, or 29%, for the year ending March 31, 2025. This growth was
driven by higher penetration among existing clients and the addition of new clients.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company maintained 34
insurance customer agreements and 78 automotive customer agreements, as well as approximately 3,800 agents and fleet customer agreements.

The Company evaluates its non-marketable equity investments for impairment
each reporting period through a qualitative assessment that considers various indicators, including significant adverse changes in the
investee’s business, legal or regulatory environment, or the ability to obtain relevant financial information.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company recorded a full impairment charge of $1.2 million related to its
joint venture investment in China. This decision was driven by escalating macroeconomic and geopolitical tensions, particularly tariff-related
uncertainties between the U.S. and China, which have adversely affected the Company’s ability to exercise operational influence
and access timely and reliable information about the joint venture’s financial position. In light of these factors and applying
the principle of prudence, management determined that the investment no longer meets the criteria for recoverability and accordingly recognized
a full impairment.

Other Income increased
$6.2 million, or 743%, for the year ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by the $7.6 million
provision and short-term liability releases during the year as part of our Balance Sheet clean-up project, partially offset by a
$0.7 million write-off of customer contracts in our U.K. subsidiary due to the pause in GAP sales.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation
and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of finance costs, taxes, depreciation
& amortization and certain other items from reported net profit or loss. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA aids investors by providing
an operating profit/loss without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization and certain other items to help clarify sustainability
and trends affecting the business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with U.S. GAAP
financial results in evaluating business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the
measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(1)Fair value changes in financial instruments are considered to be financing
costs as they relate to convertible notes and liability-classified preferred stock warrants previously
issued in financing transactions. These changes are non-cash as the Company does not have an unconditional
obligation to settle the convertible notes and preferred stock warrants in cash. These changes in fair
value are affected by the Company’s own share price as these are settleable/convertible into the
Company’s Ordinary Shares.
Limitations and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under U.S. GAAP. There
are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under U.S.
GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures
to evaluate their performance. These limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools.
Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures
to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our incorporation,
we have financed our growth through a blend of equity, convertible instruments, debt (including working capital lines), and customer
payments. As of March 31, 2025, we have raised an aggregate of $52.0 million, net of issuance costs, through the issuance of Ordinary Shares, convertible instruments and preferred stock of Roadzen DE. Our accumulated deficit
stood at $224.3 million as of March 31, 2025 up from $151.6 million from the previous year. These accumulated deficit stem from
substantial operating losses, which stems from fair valuation, vesting of RSU, impairment of investment and intangible assets, transaction costs arose from business combination. These losses have been detailed on the table below. We anticipate that we will continue to experience operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations
over an extended period due to the planned investments in our business. Consequently, we will need to secure additional capital
resources to support the execution of our strategic initiatives for growing our business in the coming years.

Our future capital requirements will depend on
many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers, the continued market acceptance
of our solutions, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing
activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies.
We will be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able
to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our largest sources of cash provided by operations
are increases in accounts payables and payments received from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include
employee-related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses and other overhead costs.
For the year ended March
31, 2025, net cash used in operating activities was $18.1 million, $1.1 million decrease compared to $19.2 million for the year
ended March 31, 2024. This increase primarily reflects a combination of higher net losses and changes in working capital during the current period.
The cash outflow in the
year ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a net loss of $73.1 million, and net cash outflows of $2.4 million resulting from
changes in operating assets and liabilities, including increased receivables and lower payables. These outflows were partially
offset by non-cash adjustments totaling $57.4 million.
Non-cash charges for the
period included:
-$14.8 million in fair value losses,
-$47.2 million in stock-based compensation expense,
-$2.0 million in depreciation and amortization,
-$1.2 million in impairment of investment
These were partially offset by
non-cash gains, notably:
-
$8.1 million related to the gain on deconsolidation of subsidiaries and
write-back of liabilities, and
-
$0.1 million in unrealized foreign exchange gains.
The
year-over-year increase in net cash used in operating activities reflects the impact of continued investment in strategic initiatives,
increased working capital outflows due to timing differences in collections and payments. Management continues
to monitor liquidity closely and is actively pursuing measures to optimize working capital and align operational costs with revenue growth
expectations.

Forward Purchase Agreement
On August 25, 2023, the Company (then named Vahanna
Tech Edge Acquisition I Corp.) entered into an agreement with (i) Meteora Capital Partners, LP (“MCP”), (ii) Meteora Select
Trading Opportunities Master, LP (“MSTO”), and (iii) Meteora Strategic Capital, LLC (“MSC” and, collectively
with MCP and MSTO, “Seller”) (the “Forward Purchase Agreement” or “FPA”) for OTC Equity Prepaid Forward
Transactions, as summarized in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on September 26, 2023 (the “Prior 8-K”).
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Prior 8-K and/or the Forward Purchase Agreement.
On January 30, 2024, the Company and the Seller
entered into an amendment to the Forward Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment amends the section of the Forward
Purchase Agreement regarding a Prepayment Shortfall by providing that the Company has the option, at its sole discretion, at any time
up to 45 days prior to the Valuation Date, to request up to $5 million in Prepayment Shortfall via ten separate written requests to Seller
in the amount of $500,000 each (each, an “Additional Shortfall Request”), provided that at the time of any Additional Shortfall
Request (i) Seller has recovered 117% of the prior Additional Shortfall Request, if any, via Shortfall Sales and (ii) the VWAP Price
over the ten trading days prior to such Additional Shortfall Request multiplied by the then current Number of Shares less Shortfall Sale
Shares held by Seller is at least seven times greater than such Additional Shortfall Request. In addition, the Amendment amends the section
of the Forward Purchase Agreement regarding Prepayment Shortfall Consideration by eliminating the 180-day period following a Trade Date
before Seller may commence selling Recycled Shares and by permitting such sales without payment by Seller of any Early Termination Obligation
until such time as the proceeds from such sales equal 117% (instead of 100% as originally provided in the Forward Purchase Agreement)
of the Prepayment Shortfall. During the year ended March 31, 2025, an additional $1 million was received from the Seller, bringing the
total cash receipts to $4.8 million.

Senior Secured Mizuho Notes
On June 30, 2023, Roadzen entered into a Note
Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with Mizuho Securities USA LLC (“Mizuho”), as administrative
agent and collateral agent, and as a purchaser, pursuant to which Mizuho purchased an aggregate principal amount of $7,500,000 of senior
secured notes (the “Mizuho Notes”). The Mizuho Notes bear interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum, which will automatically increase
by 5% if we fail to prepay the Mizuho Notes upon the occurrence of certain mandatory prepayment events as set forth in the Note Purchase
Agreement; however, we may prepay all or any portion of the Mizuho Notes prior to maturity at our option without penalty.
As a condition precedent to closing under the
Note Purchase Agreement, Roadzen entered into a Security Agreement, pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties granted a first priority
lien on substantially all of its assets to Mizuho, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Purchasers.
The Note Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants
that restrict the Note Parties’ ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, create liens, incur indebtedness, make
payments and investments and transact with affiliates. Additionally, the Loan Parties are collectively required to maintain a cash reserve
of at least $1 million in the aggregate to satisfy the minimum liquidity condition as set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement.
The Note Purchase Agreement
provides for customary events of default, if not cured or waived, would result in the acceleration of substantially all of the outstanding
debt and interest owed under the Mizuho Notes (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) and default
interest of an additional two percent (2.0%) for so long as an event of default is continuing.
The Mizuho Notes were originally scheduled to
mature on June 30, 2024. On June 30, 2024, Mizuho granted to the Company a waiver of payment until July 31, 2024. On July 26, 2024, the
Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the senior secured notes, providing for an additional $4 million in principal amount to a total
of $11.5 million, and an extension of the maturity date to December 31, 2024. Terms of the notes were otherwise the same as the original
notes issued in June 2023, including an interest rate of 15% per annum, and did not require any additional warrants. On December 31,
2024, and again on January 31, 2025 while Amendment No. 2 to the senior secured notes were being drafted, Mizuho granted to the Company
a waiver of payment until January 31, 2025 and then February 28, 2025.
On February 28, 2025, the Company entered into
Amendment No. 2 to the Note Purchase Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), by and among the Company, Roadzen, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (the “Issuer”), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto (the “Guarantors”) and Mizuho,
as administrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”) and as a purchaser thereunder (in such capacity,
the “Purchaser”), which amended the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2023 (as previously amended), by and among
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Agent and the Purchaser. Among other things, the Amendment provides for (i) an extension of the maturity
date of the $11.5 million in principal amount of senior secured notes issued under the Note Purchase Agreement (the “Notes”)
from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025 and (ii) the joinder of the Company as an additional Guarantor under the Note Purchase Agreement.
In addition, the Company agreed to file, by March 30, 2025, a registration statement registering the resale of the Company’s ordinary
shares, par value $0.0001 per share (“Ordinary Shares”), issuable upon exercise of the Warrant (as defined below) and to
use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement effective as soon as practicable after filing.
Also on February 28, 2025, in connection with
the Second Amendment, the Company issued to the Purchaser an amended and restated warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase an
additional 104,566 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.001 per share, for a total of up to 1,537,083 Ordinary Shares at an exercise
price of $0.001 per share. The Warrant amends, restates and supersedes in its entirety the warrant to purchase up to 1,432,517 Ordinary
Shares at an exercise price of $0.001 per shares issued to the Purchaser on May 14, 2024 pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.
Roadzen used the proceeds of the Mizuho Notes
to support general corporate and working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes.
63
December 2023 Junior Unsecured Convertible Debenture
On December 15, 2023, the Company issued a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the “December 2023 Convertible SPA”), among the Company and the investors party thereto from time to time.
Pursuant to the terms of the December 2023 Convertible SPA, the Company may issue and sell an aggregate of up to $50 million in principal
amount of convertible debentures (the “December 2023 Convertible Debentures”), on a private placement basis (collectively,
the “December 2023 Private Placement”). The Company held an initial closing of the December 2023 Private Placement, at which
it received $400,000 in proceeds on December 15, 2023. On January 19, 2024, the Company issued an additional convertible debenture under
the December 2023 Convertible SPA in the principal amount of $500,000 to Supurna VedBrat (the “VedBrat Debenture”), a director
of the Company, for a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the VedBrat Debenture. Also on January 19, 2024, Ms. VedBrat became
a party to the December 2023 Convertible SPA and entered into a letter agreement with the Company (the “Letter Agreement”)
with respect to her investment in the Company pursuant to the VedBrat Debenture. On February 7, 2024 the Company issued an additional
convertible debenture under the December 2023 Convertible SPA in the principal amount of $200,000 and may sell additional Debentures
at additional closings from time to time.
The December 2023 Convertible Debentures bear
interest, in arrears, at a rate of 13% per annum, payable semi-annually commencing on June 15, 2024, and matures on December 15, 2025.
Interest is payable in kind, subject to the right of the Company to make any interest payments in cash. The Debentures are convertible
into the Company’s Ordinary Shares, at the election of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of $10.00 per Ordinary
Share (the “Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits,
reclassifications and the like. In addition, if the average volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares for the 30 trading days
immediately preceding December 15, 2024 (the “Average VWAP”) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, the Conversion
Price will be adjusted to an amount equal to such Average VWAP, subject to a floor of 85% of the Conversion Price then in effect. In
addition, as the Average VWAP was less than the Conversion Price then in effect, the Conversion Price was adjusted to $8.50, an amount
equal to 159,995 Ordinary Shares, as of December 15, 2024. The Company has the right to require the Debentures to be converted into Ordinary
Shares if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds 130% of the then-applicable Conversion Price for any 20 trading days within
a consecutive 30 trading day-period.
The indebtedness evidenced by the December 2023
Convertible Debentures is subordinate to all other indebtedness of the Company. The Company has agreed in the December 2023 Convertible
Debentures that it will not, while the December 2023 Convertible Debentures remain outstanding, incur additional indebtedness other than
indebtedness (i) evidenced by other December 2023 Convertible Debentures, (ii) senior to the December 2023 Convertible Debentures in
an aggregate principal amount of no more than $50 million and (iii) pari passu or junior to the December 2023 Convertible Debentures
in an aggregate principal amount of no more than $50 million. The December 2023 Convertible Debentures contain customary events of default,
including defaults in payment or performance that remain uncured after specified cure periods and certain events of bankruptcy.
Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement,
the Company has (i) granted Ms. VedBrat certain most favored nations rights with respect to future issuances of securities while the
VedBrat Debenture is outstanding and (ii) agreed to issue to Ms. VedBrat, warrants to purchase a number of Ordinary Shares equal in value
as of December 15, 2023 to ten percent (10%) of the original principal balance of the VedBrat Debenture, at an exercise price of $8.50
per share. The Company entered into a substantially similar letter agreement with the first investor that purchased December 2023 Convertible
Debentures at the initial closing under the December 2023 Convertible SPA.
64
Senior Secured 2024 Notes
On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (the “March 2024 SPA”) with Supurna VedBrat and Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP (together,
the “2024 Purchasers”). Ms. VedBrat is a director of the Company. Ajay Shah, another director of the Company, and his wife,
are trustees of the general partner of the Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP. Each of the 2024 Purchasers purchased $500,000 in principal
amount of the 2024 SPA Notes on the date of the March 2024 SPA (the “March 2024 Notes”). On May 23, 2024, Ms. VedBrat purchased
an additional $500,000 in principal amount of the 2024 SPA Notes (the “May 2024 Note”).
Pursuant to the terms of the March 2024 SPA, the
Company may issue and sell up to an additional $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 SPA Notes to one or more other
purchasers. The March 2024 SPA contains covenants by the Company, including requirements to cause each of its subsidiaries (other than
certain excluded subsidiaries) to guaranty the Company’s obligations under the 2024 SPA Notes and to take certain actions required
to grant the 2024 Purchasers perfected security interests in the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to the existing
liens of Mizuho). Pursuant to the terms of the March 2024 SPA, the Company and the 2024 Purchasers will enter into the Buyer Security
Documents as defined in the March 2024 SPA.
The 2024 SPA Notes bear interest at a rate of
17.5% per annum and mature on the six-month anniversary of funding of the respective note (the “Initial Rate Adjustment Date”).
Interest is payable in cash or in kind, at the option of the Company, on each three month anniversary of funding through the Initial
Rate Adjustment Date (after which date all interest is payable in cash unless the parties agree to payment in kind). The Company’s
failure to repay all principal and accrued interest by the Initial Rate Adjustment Date would not constitute an event of default under
the applicable 2024 SPA Note, however, the interest rate payable under such 2024 SPA Note would increase on such date to 19.5% per annum
going forward, and thereafter would increase by an additional 200 basis points on each monthly anniversary of the Initial Rate Adjustment
Date until each of the respective 2024 SPA Notes is paid in full, subject to a maximum interest rate of 29.5% per annum. Following the
Initial Rate Adjustment Date, all unpaid principal and accrued interest would be payable within five business days of the holder’s
written demand. If any interest under the 2024 SPA Notes is paid in kind, such payment would be made through the issuance of that number
of the Company’s ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value per share (“Ordinary Shares”), calculated by dividing the amount
payable by the lowest of (i) $8.00, (ii) the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Ordinary Shares over the 60 trading
days ending three trading days prior to the interest payment date, (iii) the opening price per share of the Ordinary Shares in any public
offering of Ordinary Shares after the issuance of the respective 2024 SPA Notes, and (iv) the price per Ordinary Share after market close
on the first day of trading following any such public offering of Ordinary Shares.
The indebtedness evidenced by the 2024 SPA Notes
is intended to rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company, other than the Company’s outstanding indebtedness
to Mizuho, and is to be secured pursuant to the Buyer Security Documents. The 2024 SPA Notes contain covenants of the Company that, among
other things, prohibit the Company from incurring additional indebtedness or liens, subject to certain exceptions, for so long as the
2024 SPA Notes are outstanding. The 2024 SPA Notes contain customary events of default, including certain defaults in payment or performance
and certain events of bankruptcy.
Also pursuant to the terms of the March 2024 SPA,
the Company agreed to issue to each Purchaser warrants (the “March 2024 SPA Warrants”) to purchase, for each $10,000 in original
principal amount of 2024 SPA Notes purchased, 1,000 Ordinary Shares. Each of the March 2024 SPA Warrant will be exercisable at any time
during the period commencing on March 28, 2025 (the “Vesting Date”) through March 28, 2031 (or until the dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the Company, if earlier). The exercise price of the March 2024 SPA Warrants is equal to 80% of the lower of (i) the
VWAP of the Company’s Ordinary Shares (RZDN), as reported on the relevant market or exchange, over the 60 trading days subsequent
to the first loan funding, (ii) the opening price of any public offering of straight equity securities of the Company occurring within
six months after the issue date of the March 2024 SPA Warrants and (iii) the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares over the 60 trading days immediately
prior to the Vesting Date. The March 2024 SPA Warrants have customary anti-dilution protections in the event the Company declares dividends
or distributions on the Ordinary Shares or subdivides, combines or reclassifies its outstanding Ordinary Shares. On April 22, 2024, the
Company issued March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP. On June 20, 2024, the
Company issued March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Ms. VedBrat and on October 27, 2024 issued additional March
2024 SPA Warrants to purchase an additional 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Ms. VedBrat in connection with her purchase of the May 2024 Note.
Secured, Non-Convertible 2022 Debentures
One of our material subsidiaries issued Secured,
Non-Convertible Debentures with NP1 Capital Trust with an aggregate principal amount of $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended March
31, 2023 with varying maturity dates between January 2024 and July 2024 and interest rates ranging from 19.25% to 20.00% per annum. The
principal outstanding as of March 31, 2025 is $1.7 million. On September 30, 2024 the Company entered into an amendment agreement
restructuring the principal repayments and extending the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Company has not honored the repayment of the above debentures as on the amended date but has obtained an extension
from the lender up to July 31, 2025. However, there is no new agreement in place.
65
Underwritten Public Offerings
On December 15, 2024, the Company entered into
an underwriting agreement with ThinkEquity LLC, relating to a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “December Offering”)
of an aggregate of up to (i) 1,900,000 shares of the Company’s Ordinary Shares at a price to the public of $1.25 per share (the
“December Shares”), and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants” and, together with the December Shares,
the “December Securities”) to purchase 400,000 Ordinary Shares at a price to the public of $1.249 per Pre-Funded Warrant.
The closing of the December Offering occurred
on December 17, 2024. The gross proceeds to the Company from the sale of the December Securities, before deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, was $2,875,000.
Upon closing of the December Offering, the Company
issued ThinkEquity warrants (the “December TE Warrants”) as compensation to purchase up to 115,000 Ordinary Shares (5% of
the aggregate number of the December Securities sold). The December TE Warrants will be exercisable at a per share exercise price of
$1.5625 and are exercisable, in whole or in part, during the five year period commencing with the commencement of sales in the December
Offering.
On January 2, 2025, the Company entered into a
placement agency agreement (the “Agency Agreement”) with ThinkEquity LLC (the “Placement Agent”), pursuant to
which the Company agreed to issue and sell directly to one or more investors, in a best efforts offering (the “January Offering”),
an aggregate of 2,222,300 of the Company’s Ordinary Shares, at an offering price of $2.25 per Share. The Offering closed on January
6, 2025. The Company received gross proceeds of $5,000,175 in connection with the January Offering, before deducting Placement Agent
fees and other January Offering expenses payable by the Company.
As part of its compensation for acting as Placement
Agent for the January Offering, the Company paid the Placement Agent a cash fee of 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds and also issued
to the Placement Agent warrants to purchase 111,115 Ordinary Shares (the “January TE Warrants”). The January TE Warrants
have a term of five years commencing January 2, 2025, are exercisable commencing July 2, 2025, and have an exercise price of $2.8125
per Ordinary Share.
Debt Exchange
On December 27, 2024, the Company entered into
two separate subscription agreements (the “Exchange Agreements”) with related parties, Marco Polo Securities, Inc. (“Marco
Polo”) and Avacara PTE Ltd. (“Avacara”). Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements, on that date, approximately
$3.5 million in aggregate of liabilities of the Company to such entities was canceled in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of
1,227,867 ordinary shares (the “Exchange Shares”) of the Company (with 892,857 Shares issued to Marco Polo and 335,000 Shares
issued to Avacara), as contemplated by the binding term sheets entered into by the Company on July 18, 2024 and reported in the Form
8-K filed by the Company on July 23, 2024. The Chairman of the Board of the Company, Steven Carlson, is the principal owner of Marco
Polo and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Rohan Malhotra, is the principal owner and Managing Partner of Avacara, a significant
shareholder of the Company.
The Subscription Agreements include customary
“piggyback” registration rights, as well as demand registration rights which require the Company to register the Exchange
Shares if requested by Marco Polo or Avacara in the event that the Shares have not been registered on a “piggyback” basis
within 90 days following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Closing”).
Also on December 27, 2024, the Company entered
into separate lock-up letter agreements (the “Exchange Lock-Up Agreements”) with each of Marco Polo and Avacara, pursuant
to which each such entity agreed not to sell any of the Exchange Shares issued to it for a period of nine months following the Exchange
Closing, except that 30% of each holder’s Exchange Shares may be sold as of the 91st day after the Exchange Closing Date, another
30% may be sold on the 181st day after the Exchange Closing Date and the remainder may be sold as of one day after the nine month anniversary
of the Exchange Closing Date.
March
Junior Notes
On
March 31, 2025, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the “Investor”)
under which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a registered public offering, junior convertible notes for up to an aggregate principal
amount of $2,300,000 (the “Junior Notes”) that may be convertible into the Company’s Ordinary Shares. On April 1, 2025,
the Company completed the sale of the Junior Notes to the Investor and issued the Junior Notes. The Junior Notes were sold for a gross
purchase price of $2,000,000 before fees and other expenses. The Junior Notes will mature one year from the date of issuance and will
bear interest at a rate of 16% per annum (increasing to 18% per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of
default). 25% of the principal amount of the Junior Notes (less any amount previously converted by the holders), together with accrued
but unpaid interest, is payable quarterly, commencing three months after the date of issuance.
The
Junior Notes will have an initial conversion price of $2.00 and will be convertible at any time, in whole or in part and subject to certain
beneficial ownership limitations, at the election of the holders, subject to customary adjustments upon any stock split, stock dividend,
stock combination, recapitalization or similar event. The Company may redeem all or any portion of outstanding Junior Notes at any time
upon at least five trading days’ written notice by paying an amount equal to the principal amount of the Junior Notes being redeemed,
together with interest accrued on such principal amount through the date of redemption, and additional interest that would accrue on
such principal amount through the maturity date (the “Make Whole Amount”).
Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Junior Notes), the Investor may (i) either require the Company to redeem all
or any portion of the Junior Notes, (ii) or, in the case of a failure to make a required quarterly payment under the Junior Notes, convert
all or any portion of the Junior Notes at a price equal to the Event of Default Conversion Price (as defined in the Junior Notes). The
Company also agrees not to enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Junior Notes) unless (i) the Successor
Entity (as defined in the Junior Notes) (if other than the Company) assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under the
Junior Notes and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Notes prior to such Fundamental Transaction,
or (ii) at or prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, the Company redeems the Junior Notes in full by paying to the
holder an amount in cash representing all outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest (including Default Interest, as applicable)
and Make-Whole Amount.
Subject
to the provisions of the Junior Notes, if, at any time while the Junior Notes are outstanding, the Company carries out one or more Subsequent
Placements (as defined in the Junior Notes), the Investor will have the right to require the Company to first use up to 25% of the net
proceeds of such Subsequent Placement to redeem all or a portion of the Junior Notes in cash at the Redemption Price (as defined in the
Junior Notes) applicable to the principal amount subject to the Holder Optional Redemption (as defined in the Junior Notes) plus any
other amounts, if any, then owing to the holder of the Junior Notes. Subject to the provisions of the Junior Notes, the Company may redeem
all or any portion of outstanding Junior Notes at any time upon at least five trading days’ written notice by paying an amount
equal to the principal amount of the Junior Notes being redeemed, together with interest accrued on such principal amount through the
date of redemption, and the Make Whole Amount.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities,
which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2025. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in connection with
our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Cash and loans
As of March 31, 2025, we had $5.1 million of
cash and cash equivalents, including $0.2 million of non-current restricted cash, and $22.9 million of repayable debt in the form of
loans from banks and other parties. Our cash and cash equivalents and loans are held for working capital purposes. As of March 31, 2025,
we do not believe a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates during any of the periods presented would have had a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Convertible Notes
As of March 31, 2025, we have no variable rate
convertible notes outstanding.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Transaction Exposure
Our results of operations and cash flows are subject
to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All our revenue is generated in local currencies. Our expenses are
generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in India, the U.K.
and the U.S. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in
foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial
statements. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess
our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.
Translation Exposure
We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange
rates, the translating adjustments resulting from the conversion of our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars
would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which is part of stockholders’ equity.
Price Risk
We have invested in common stock of two private
companies, Moonshot — Internet SAS and Daokang (Beijing) Data Science Company Ltd, which were accounted for under the measurement
alternative. These investments are considered as long-term, strategic investments. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies
are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial
markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-marketable equity securities. Further, observable transactions
at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that certain accounting policies involve
a high degree of judgment and complexity. The application of accounting policies and preparation of our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and
accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making
those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions
and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in our consolidated
financial statements. These estimates involve estimating allowance for accounts receivable, fair values of financial instruments, measurement
of defined benefit obligations, impairment of non-financial assets, useful lives of property plant and equipment and intangible assets,
income taxes, certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities, and other contingent liabilities. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a description of our significant accounting policies involving these estimates
and judgments.
67
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Company is an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to
take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced
disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, the Company will not
be subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies which may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements to those of other public companies more difficult.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management is currently evaluating the impact
of any recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, on its consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.
Not required for smaller reporting companies.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The financial statements required to be filed
pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15 of Part IV of
this Annual Report.

None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the effectiveness
of Roadzen’ disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act). Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Roadzen’ disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial
reporting
As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Roadzen’ internal control over financial
reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Roadzen’ internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that:
(1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company,
68
(2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors, and
(3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Our management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on this assessment, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2025.
Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm
This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to an exemption established by the JOBS Act for “emerging growth
companies.”
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended March 31, 2025 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information.
Insider Trading Arrangements
No director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated any
contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities of the registrant intended to satisfy
the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c); or (ii) any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in paragraph
(c) of Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent
Inspections.

Composition of the Roadzen Board of Directors
When considering whether directors and director
nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Roadzen board to satisfy its oversight

The Roadzen board consists of seven (7) members.
Each director will be nominated for a one (1) year term to be elected at the subsequent annual meeting of the shareholders. At each succeeding
annual meeting of the shareholders of Roadzen, each of the successors elected to replace the directors whose term expires at that annual
meeting shall be elected for a one-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject
to their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Board of Directors Meetings
During the year ended March 31, 2025, our board
met 5 times, including videoconference meetings, the audit committee met 8 times, the compensation committee met 3 times
and the nominating and corporate governance committee met 4 times. All directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate
number of meetings of the board, all of the audit committee members attended 75% or more of the audit committee
meetings, all of the compensation committee members attended 75% or more of the compensation committee meeting, and

Director Independence
Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority
of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person who has no material
relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship
with the company). Roadzen’s board of directors has seven (7) directors. Roadzen has determined that each of Mr. Adhikari, Mr.
Shah, Ms. VedBrat, Ms. Ashcroft and Ms. Glossman is an “independent director” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards
and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Officer and Director Compensation
Overview
The policies of Roadzen with respect to the compensation
of its executive officers are administered by Roadzen’s board in consultation with its compensation committee. The compensation
decisions regarding Roadzen’s executives are based on Roadzen’s need to retain those individuals who continue to perform
at or above Roadzen’s expectations and to attract individuals with the skills necessary for Roadzen to achieve its business plan.
Roadzen intends to be competitive with other similarly situated companies in its industry.
Roadzen believes that performance-based and equity-based
compensation can be an important component of the total executive compensation package for maximizing shareholder value while, at the
same time, attracting, motivating and retaining high-quality executives.
Roadzen’s executive officers receive a combination
of cash and equity compensation. Roadzen’s compensation committee is charged with performing an annual review of Roadzen’s
executive officers’ cash and equity compensation to determine whether they provide adequate incentives and motivation to executive
officers and whether they adequately compensate the executive officers relative to comparable officers in other companies. In addition
to the guidance provided by its nomination and compensation committees, Roadzen may utilize the services of third parties from time to
time in connection with the hiring and compensation awarded to executive employees. This could include subscriptions to executive compensation
surveys and other databases or use of a third-party compensation consultant.
Roadzen’s non-employee directors are currently
entitled to receive $200,000 in annual compensation for services rendered to Roadzen. The Chairman and the Audit Chair are entitled to
receive an extra $50,000 in annual compensation. The non-employee directors have elected to receive their compensation for fiscal year
2025 only in equity, however, no cash compensation or equity awards have been paid or issued as of this filing.
Roadzen 2023 Incentive Plan
Roadzen adopted the Roadzen 2023 Omnibus Incentive
Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), to be administered by the Roadzen board or by a committee or administrator appointed by the
board. The purpose of the Incentive Plan is to give employees of Roadzen (including executive and non-executive directors and officers
as well as consultants) an opportunity to become shareholders of Roadzen, and thereby to participate in its future long-term success
and prosperity. The Incentive Plan includes the following terms and provisions:
●The total number of shares to be issued under the Incentive Plan
(in addition to awards assumed pursuant to the Business Combination) shall initially not
exceed ten percent of total issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares (subject to annual increases
pursuant to an evergreen provision as provided in the Incentive Plan).
●Roadzen’s compensation committee shall review the Incentive
Plan and shall make recommendations regarding the terms and conditions (including vesting)
of each award, which may be based on (but is not limited to) the employment period or performance
conditions or any combination thereof as determined by Roadzen’s compensation committee.
73
●Roadzen may set customary lock-up provision for the shares issued
under the Incentive Plan as well as customary limitations imposed by its Insider Trading
Policy.
●Forfeited shares, which are subject to awards, shall again be
available for future grants under the Incentive Plan.
●Awards granted under the Incentive Plan may be subject to participants
entering into customary non-compete and non-solicit agreements with Roadzen if determined
by Roadzen’s compensation committee and on the terms set by it.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Roadzen’s board of directors has three standing
committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Subject to phase-in rules
and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A under the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company
be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq require that the
compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. The charter of each committee is available on
Roadzen’s website.
Audit Committee
Ms. Glossman, Ms. VedBrat and Mr. Adhikari serve
as members of our audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three
(3) members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent, subject to the exception described below. Ms. Glossman, Ms. VedBrat
and Mr. Adhikari are all independent.
Ms. Glossman serves as chair of the audit committee.
Each member of the audit committee meets the financial literacy requirements of Nasdaq listing standards and our board of directors has
determined that Ms. Glossman is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.
The purpose of the audit committee is, amongst
other things, to prepare the audit committee report required by the SEC to be included in our proxy statement and to assist our board
of directors in overseeing and monitoring (i) the quality and integrity of our financial statements, (ii) our compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements, (iii) our independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence, (iv) the performance
of our internal audit function, and (v) the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm.
Our board of directors has adopted a written charter
for the audit committee, which is available on our website.
Compensation Committee
Mr. Adhikari and Mr. Shah serve as members of
our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two (2) members
of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Mr. Adhikari and Mr. Shah are both independent. Mr. Adhikari serves as
chair of the compensation committee.
The purpose of the compensation committee, amongst
other things, is to assist our board of directors in discharging its responsibilities relating to (i) setting our compensation programs
and compensation of our executive officers and directors, (ii) monitoring our incentive and equity-based compensation plans, and (iii)
preparing the compensation committee report required to be included in our proxy statement under the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Our board of directors has adopted a written charter
for the compensation committee, which is available on our website. The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in
its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and is directly responsible
for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. The compensation committee will consider the independence
of each adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant,
external legal counsel or any other adviser.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Ms. Ashcroft and Mr. Shah serve as members of
our nominating and corporate governance committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have
at least two (2) members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, all of whom must be independent. Ms. Ashcroft and Mr.
Shah are both independent. Ms. Ashcroft serves as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. The nominating and corporate
governance committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating
and corporate governance committee considers persons identified by its members, management, stockholders, investment bankers and others.
74
Our board of directors has adopted a written charter
for the nominating and corporate governance committee, which is available on our website. The guidelines for selecting nominees generally
include that persons to be nominated:
●should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in
business, education or public service;
●should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience
to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and bring a range of skills,
diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and
●should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism
and intense dedication to serving the interests of the stockholders.
The nominating and corporate governance committee
will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism
in evaluating a person’s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating and corporate governance committee
may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time
to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The
nominating and corporate governance committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons.
We have not formally established any specific,
minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating
nominees for director, the Roadzen board considers the factors set forth above.
The nominating and corporate governance committee
will review annually the relationships between directors, the Company and members of management and recommend to the Board whether each
director qualifies as “independent” under the Board’s definition of “independence” and the applicable rules
of Nasdaq and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Code of Business Conduct
We adopted a new code of business conduct (the
“code of business conduct”) that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, which is available on our website. Our code of business conduct is a “code
of ethics,” as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. Copies of the code of business conduct and charters for each of our committees
will be provided without charge upon request from us and are posted on our website. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding
amendments to, or waivers of, provisions of our code of ethics on our Internet website.

guidelines in accordance with the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq that serve as a flexible framework within which our board of directors
and its committees operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas including board membership criteria and director qualifications,
director responsibilities, board agenda, roles of the chair of the board, principal executive officer and presiding director, meetings
of independent directors, committee responsibilities and assignments, board member access to management and independent advisors, director
communications with third parties, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, evaluation of senior management
and management succession planning. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines is posted on our website.

certain reports regarding ownership of and transactions in our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of the

Clawback Policy
We have adopted a compensation recovery policy
(the Company’s Clawback Policy), which was effective November 30, 2023, that is compliant with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, as required
by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Policies and Practices for Granting Certain Equity Awards
Our policies and practices regarding the granting
of equity awards are carefully designed to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws and to maintain the integrity of our executive
compensation program. The Compensation Committee is responsible for the timing and terms of equity awards to executives and other eligible
employees.
The timing of equity award
grants is determined with consideration to a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the achievement of pre-established performance
targets, market conditions and internal milestones. The Company does not follow a predetermined schedule for the granting of equity awards;
instead, each grant is considered on a case-by-case basis to align with the Company’s strategic objectives and to ensure the competitiveness
of our compensation packages.
In determining the timing
and terms of an equity award, the Board or the Compensation Committee may consider material nonpublic information to ensure that such
grants are made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Board’s or the Compensation Committee’s procedures to prevent
the improper use of material nonpublic information in connection with the granting of equity awards include oversight by legal counsel
and, where appropriate, delaying the grant of equity awards until the public disclosure of such material nonpublic information.
The Company is committed
to maintaining transparency in its executive compensation practices and to making equity awards in a manner that is not influenced by
the timing of the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. The
Company regularly reviews its policies and practices related to equity awards to ensure they meet the evolving standards of corporate
governance and continue to serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
Plans
In connection with our Business Combination, our
Board and shareholders adopted the Incentive Plan as well as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
Awards under the Incentive Plan are available
for employees, directors and consultants. The general purpose of the Incentive Plan is to motivate the performance in the achievement
of the Company’s business objectives and align the interests of recipients with the long- term interests of the Company’s
shareholders. To accomplish such purposes, the Incentive Plan provides that the Company may grant (i) options, (ii) stock appreciation
rights, (iii) restricted shares, (iv) restricted stock units, (v) performance-based awards (including performance-based restricted shares
and restricted stock units), (vi) other share-based awards, (vii) other cash-based awards or (viii) any combination of the foregoing.
79
The general purpose of the ESPP is to allow employees
an opportunity to participate in the ownership of the Company through deductions from their pay to be utilized to purchase ordinary shares
of the Company at prices that could be at a discount to the market.
The following table summarizes the number of Ordinary
Shares authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans as of March 31, 2025.

Securities Beneficial Ownership Table
The following table sets forth beneficial ownership
of our ordinary shares as of June 20, 2025 by:
●each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the
issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares; and
●each of our named executive officers and directors.
Beneficial ownership is determined according to
the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she, or it possesses sole or
shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within
60 days of June 20, 2025.
Our beneficial ownership is based on 74,290,986
Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as of June 20, 2025.
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all
persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by them.

82
On December 27, 2024, Roadzen entered into two
separate subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with Marco Polo Securities, Inc. (“Marco Polo”)
and Avacara PTE Ltd. (“Avacara”). Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements, on that date, approximately $3.5
million in aggregate of liabilities of Roadzen to such entities was canceled in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 1,227,867
Ordinary Shares of Roadzen (with 892,857 Ordinary Shares issued to Marco Polo and 335,000 Ordinary Shares issued to Avacara), as contemplated
by the binding term sheets entered into by Roadzen on July 18, 2024. The Chairman of the Board of Roadzen, Steven Carlson, is the principal
owner of Marco Polo and Roadzen’s Chief Executive Officer, Rohan Malhotra, is the principal owner and Managing Partner of Avacara,
a significant shareholder of Roadzen. The Subscription Agreements include customary “piggyback” registration rights, as well
as demand registration rights which require Roadzen to register the Shares if requested by Marco Polo or Avacara in the event that the
Shares have not been registered on a “piggyback” basis within 90 days following the closing of the transactions contemplated
by the Subscription Agreement (the “Closing”).
Also on December 27, 2024, Roadzen entered into
separate lock-up letter agreements (the “Lock-Up Agreements”) with each of Marco Polo and Avacara, pursuant to which each
such entity agreed not to sell any of the Ordinary Shares issued to it for a period of nine months following the Closing, except that
30% of each holder’s Ordinary Shares may be sold as of the 91st day after the Closing Date, another 30% may be sold on the 181st
day after the Closing Date and the remainder may be sold as of one day after the nine month anniversary of the Closing Date.
On November 8, 2024, Roadzen entered into separate
amendments (the “RSU Amendments”) to the restricted stock unit awards (the “RSUs”) previously granted to Rohan
Malhotra, Roadzen’s Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Ankur Kamboj, Roadzen’s Chief Operating Officer. Pursuant
to the RSU Amendments, each of which was effective as of September 13, 2024, the 5,616,550 RSUs previously granted by Roadzen to Mr.
Malhotra and the 1,250,007 RSUs previously granted by Roadzen to Mr. Kamboj were each amended to change the date on which such RSUs vest
in full (subject to the executive’s continuous service with Roadzen through the vesting date) from September 18, 2024 to September
17, 2025.
Effective as of September 24, 2024, Roadzen entered
into separate letter agreements (the “Lock-Up Amendments”) with two of its significant shareholders, Avacara and Vahanna,
pursuant to which each such shareholder agreed to amend the lock-up agreement previously entered into between such shareholder and Roadzen,
as described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Roadzen on September 27, 2023 (such prior agreements, together with the lock-up
agreements entered into with other shareholders of Roadzen and described in such Form 8-K, the “Lock-Up Agreements”). Pursuant
to the terms of the Lock-Up Amendments, Avacara and Vahanna agreed to extend the term of the restrictions on transfer contained in the
Lock-Up Agreements by an additional year, from September 20, 2024 to September 20, 2025 (or such earlier date that the closing price
of Roadzen’s Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 (as adjusted for share recapitalizations, subdivisions, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like), for 20 trading days within 30 trading day period. Avacara is controlled by Rohan Malhotra, Roadzen’s
Chief Executive Officer and a member of Roadzen’s board of directors. Roadzen has been advised by a number of its other shareholders
who are party to Lock-Up Agreements that they agree to the terms of the Lock-Up Amendments, and Roadzen expects to enter into letter
agreements that are substantially similar to the Lock-Up Amendments with these other shareholders.
On March 28, 2024, Roadzen entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Supurna VedBrat and Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP (together, the “Purchasers”),
pursuant to which Roadzen agreed to issue and sell to the Purchasers, and the Purchasers agreed to purchase from Roadzen, an aggregate
of up to $2 million in principal amount of senior secured notes (the “Notes”). Ms. VedBrat is a director of Roadzen. Ajay
Shah, another director of Roadzen, and his wife, are trustees of the general partner of the Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP.
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, Roadzen agreed
to issue to each Purchaser, warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase, for each $10,000 in original principal amount of Notes
purchased, 1,000 of Roadzen’s ordinary shares (“Ordinary Shares”). Accordingly, on April 22, 2024, Roadzen issued Warrants
to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP, and Roadzen expects to issue Warrants to purchase such number
of Ordinary Shares to Ms. VedBrat in the near future. Each Warrant will be exercisable at any time during the period commencing on March
28, 2025 (or earlier under certain circumstances described in the Warrants) (as applicable, the “Vesting Date”) through March
28, 2031 (or until the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of Roadzen, if earlier). The exercise price of the Warrants is equal to
80% of the lower of (i) the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) of the Ordinary Shares, as reported on the relevant
market or exchange, over the 60 trading days subsequent to the first loan funding, (ii) the opening price of any public offering of straight
equity securities of Roadzen occurring within six months after the issue date of the Warrants and (iii) the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares
over the 60 trading days immediately prior to the Vesting Date. The Warrants have customary anti-dilution protections in the event Roadzen
declares dividends or distributions on the Ordinary Shares or subdivides, combines or reclassifies its outstanding Ordinary Shares.

Policies for Approval of Related Party Transactions
Our board of directors reviews and approves transactions
with directors, officers, and holders of five percent or more of our voting securities and their affiliates, each a related party. Prior
to our initial public offering, the material facts as to the related party’s relationship or interest in the transaction were disclosed
to our board of directors, and such transactions required the approval of a majority of the directors who were not interested in the
transaction. Further, when our stockholders were entitled to vote on a transaction with a related party, the material facts of the related
party’s relationship or interest in the transaction were disclosed to the stockholders, who approved the transaction.
Roadzen adopted a
written related party transactions policy that provides that such transactions must be approved by our audit committee. Pursuant to
this policy, the audit committee has the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving or disapproving “related party
transactions,” which are transactions or a series of transactions in which (i) the Company was or is to be a participant, (ii)
the amount of which exceeds the lesser of (x) $120,000 in the aggregate or (y) one percent of the average of the Company’s
total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and (iii) the related party had or will have a direct or indirect
material interest. A related party transaction also includes any material amendment or modification to an existing related party
transaction regardless of whether such transaction has previously been approved in accordance with our policy. For purposes of this
policy, a related person is defined as (a) any person serving as a director, director nominee or executive officer of the Company or
any person who has served in any of such roles since the beginning of the most recent fiscal year, even if he or she does not
currently serve in that role, (b) a greater than 5% beneficial owner of our Ordinary Shares, (c) any immediate family member of any
of the foregoing persons if the foregoing person is a natural person, or (d) any other person who may be a “related
person” pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures

was formed in connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement for its initial public offering. As a result, the
audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our
audit committee were approved by the Company’s board of directors. Since the formation of its audit committee, and on a going-forward basis,
the audit committee has and will pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for it by
its auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Roadzen Inc.
Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Roadzen Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively known as the “Company”)
as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statement of comprehensive loss, consolidated
statement of shareholders’ equity/deficit and consolidated statement of cash flow for each of the two years ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more
fully described in Note 2(b) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses and needs to raise
additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions among others, raised substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans on alleviation of doubt on going concern are also described in Note
2(b). The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting and Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatements whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes
to the consolidated financial statements
(in
US $, except share count)
1. Reorganization and description of business
Roadzen
Inc., a British Virgin Islands business company (the “Parent Company”, formerly known as Vahanna Tech Edge Acquisition I
Corp; and sometimes referred to in this filing as “Vahanna”) has subsidiaries located in India, the United States and the
United Kingdom. The Company is a leading Insurtech platform and provides solutions in relation to insurance products, including distribution,
pre-inspection assistance, telematics, claims submission and administration, and roadside assistance. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Roadzen Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Roadzen” or the “Company”).
Merger
agreement
On
September 20, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Vahanna, Roadzen, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Roadzen (DE)”), and
Vahanna Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Vahanna (“Merger Sub”), consummated
the Business Combination (as defined below) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 10, 2023, by and among Vahanna,
Roadzen (DE) and Merger Sub, as amended by the First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2023 (as so amended,
the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Roadzen (DE), with
Roadzen (DE) surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Vahanna (the “Merger,” and together with the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the other agreements contemplated thereby, the “Business Combination”).
In
connection with the Closing (as defined below), and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, equity interests in Vahanna and Roadzen
(DE) were converted into ordinary shares of Parent Company, $0.0001 par value (“Ordinary Shares”) as follows: (i) each outstanding
share of common stock of Roadzen (DE) including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of each outstanding share of Roadzen (DE)’s
convertible preferred stock, was cancelled and converted into 27.21 Ordinary Shares, (ii) each restricted stock unit of Roadzen (DE)
(“Roadzen (DE) RSU”) was assumed and converted into the right to receive 27.21 restricted stock units of the Parent Company
(each, a “RDZN RSU”) and were assumed as Substitute Awards under the Roadzen Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, (iii) each
equity security of Roadzen (DE) other than Roadzen (DE) common stock and Roadzen (DE) RSUs (each, a “Roadzen (DE) Additional Security”)
was assumed and converted into the right to receive equity interests that may vest, settle, convert or be exercised into 27.21 Ordinary
Shares, (iv) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing was cancelled, retired
and ceased to exist, and (v) each ordinary share of Vahanna (each, a “Vahanna Ordinary Share”) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing and not redeemed in connection with the Redemption (as defined below) remained outstanding and is now one Ordinary
Share.
Further,
in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), Vahanna changed its name to “Roadzen
Inc.”. Beginning on September 21, 2023, the Company’s Ordinary Shares and warrants trade on the Nasdaq Global Market and
Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “RDZN” and “RDZNW” respectively.
The
Company determined that Roadzen (DE) was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined
in Accounting Standards Codification 805. The determination was primarily based on the following facts:
-
Roadzen (DE) stockholders having a controlling voting interest in the Company;
-Roadzen
(DE) existing management team serving as the initial management team of the Company and holding a majority of the initial board of directors
of the Company;
-Roadzen
(DE) management continuing to hold executive management roles for the post-combination company and being responsible for the day-to-day
operations; and
-
Roadzen (DE) operations comprising the ongoing operations of the Company.
Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Roadzen (DE) issuing stock for the net assets of Vahanna,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The primary assets acquired from Vahanna related to cash amounts and a forward purchase agreement
(“FPA”) that was assumed at fair value upon closing of the Business Combination. No goodwill or other intangible assets were
recorded as a result of the Business Combination.
While
Vahanna was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Roadzen (DE) was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial
statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation
of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements reflect (i) the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior
to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Vahanna and Roadzen (DE) following the closing of the Business Combination;
(iii) the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods
presented.

In
accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the equity structure has been retroactively restated in all comparative periods
up to the Closing Date, to reflect the number of Ordinary Shares issued to Roadzen (DE) common stockholders, Roadzen (DE) convertible
preferred stockholders and holders of Vahanna ordinary shares not redeemed in connection with the Redemption. As such, the shares and
corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to Roadzen (DE) convertible preferred stock, the common stock of Roadzen
(DE) and Vahanna Ordinary Shares not redeemed in connection with the Redemption prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively
restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
a) Basis of presentation and consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that management considers necessary for
a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and reflect the financial
statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. When the Company
does not have a controlling interest in an investee but exerts significant influence over the investee, the Company applies the equity
method of accounting.
b) Liquidity and going concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue
to meet its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business.
As
of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses, negative operating cash flows, and a negative
working capital position. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, management believes that this doubt can be alleviated based on a clear and executable mitigation strategy currently
underway.
To
support this conclusion, the Company has implemented a comprehensive plan centered around capital raising, liability restructuring,
and operational cost optimization. In FY25, the Company eliminated approximately $12.6 million
in short-term liabilities through a combination of equity issuance and cash settlements. This included converting $3.4 million
of liabilities into equity and settling $8.8 million
of vendor payables for just $1.65 million
in cash.
Further,
Roadzen is actively pursuing both equity and debt capital to strengthen its balance sheet. The Company is currently raising funds through
a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) transaction with original investors, which includes both fresh capital and the
conversion of existing Vahanna debt into equity.
The Company is also exploring new long-term credit facilities
to refinance short-term obligations and create a more sustainable capital structure. Management remains engaged in active discussions
to finalize additional equity and debt transactions over the coming months.
Based on the progress made to date—demonstrated by completed transactions, advanced negotiations, and investor
commitments—management believes it has formulated and is executing a viable plan to obtain sufficient liquidity to meet obligations
as they fall due over the next 12 months. As a result, management expects to alleviate the substantial doubt regarding the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.
The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets or the classification
of liabilities that might be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
c) Use of estimates
The
preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical
experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,
the Company evaluates its estimates and underlying assumptions, including those related to the allowance for accounts receivables, fair
values of financial instruments, measurement of defined benefit obligations, impairment of non-financial assets, useful lives of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, income taxes, certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities, and other contingent liabilities.
Although these estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates, management believes
that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable.

(in
US $, except share count)
Estimates
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
d) Reclassifications
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company has reclassified certain expenses related to its India brokerage operations to better
align with their true nature and industry practice. These expenses, initially categorized under Cost of Services, have been reclassified
to Sales & Marketing expenses during the current quarter. This reclassification is based on the recognition that these costs are
primarily associated with marketing and sales efforts, including advertising, promotions, and customer acquisition, which more accurately
reflect the Company’s efforts to drive revenue.
To
maintain consistency and comparability, the Company has also adjusted the comparative financial statements of prior periods to conform
to the current period presentation. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified $1,029,330 from Cost of Services to Sales & Marketing
for the year ended March 31, 2025 and $192,285 in the year ended March 31, 2024.
This
reclassification impacts the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, where these expenses are now reported under Sales
& Marketing instead of Cost of Services. This reclassification does not affect the Company’s net income or loss, nor does it
alter the figures presented in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, or Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Deficit. The change ensures that the financial statements
provide a clearer and more accurate view of the Company’s cost structure.
e) Revenue
Revenues
consist primarily of revenue from:
-insurance
policy distribution in the form of commissions, brokerage, underwriting and other fees; and
-insurance
support services comprised of pre-inspection and risk assessment, roadside assistance, extended
warranty, and claim processing using the Company’s IaaS platform.
The
Company recognizes revenue at the time of transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues cannot be recognized until the performance
obligation(s) are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer.
Income
from distribution of insurance policies
Insurance
policy distribution and brokerage income:
The
Company enters into contracts with insurance companies for the purpose of distributing insurance products to end consumers. The Company’s
performance obligation under these contracts is to sell insurance policies to earn commissions, brokerage and other fees. Revenue from
distribution services is recognized at a point in time when the related services are rendered as per the terms of the agreement with
customers. Revenue is disclosed net of the Goods and Service tax charged on such services.
Distribution
fee from underwriting and pricing:
The
Company enters into contracts with insurance companies for the purpose of underwriting insurance products for the automotive segment
including its pricing on behalf of insurers. The risk of underwriting the insurance contract is covered by the insurer and thus the Company
is considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue. The Company’s performance obligation under these contracts is
to underwrite and price the policies. The Company generates underwriting fees termed as Managing General Agent fees (MGA fees) on provision
of those services. The underwriting fees are determined as a percentage of net insurance premiums payable to the insurer (net of all
commissions, royalties, and administration fees). Revenue from underwriting and pricing is recognized upfront based on the point in time
i.e., at the time the policy is issued to the customer.
IaaS
platform enabled services:
Roadside
assistance and extended warranty income:
The
Company enters into contracts with insurance companies and other subscribers in order to provide roadside assistance services and extended
warranty services to their policyholders/subscribers. The Company’s performance obligation under these contracts is to provide
roadside assistance and extended warranty services as a stand ready obligation. The Company is the primary obligor in these transactions
and has latitude in establishing prices and selecting and contracting with suppliers, and is accordingly considered as principal
For
the purpose of recognizing gross revenue. Revenue from roadside assistance and extended warranty services is recorded over the
tenure of contract which is usually one
year.

Inspection
income:
The
Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to inspect vehicles for accident claims made by their policyholders. The Company’s
performance obligation under these contracts is to inspect and assist in assessing claims for and on behalf of the customers, i.e. the
insurance companies. The Company engages with multiple vendors to provide these services in different geographies. The Company is the
primary obligor in the transaction and has latitude in establishing prices, and selecting and contracting with suppliers, and is accordingly
considered as principal for the purpose of recognizing revenue. Revenue from inspection and risk assessment is recorded when the inspections
are conducted.
Administration
fee from insurance support and service plan administration:
The
Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to provide insurance support services which includes premium collection,
policy administration, claims handling and processing, customer service, updating customer files, etc., to provide better customer
experience for the policyholders/subscribers. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through
effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document and process claims, and control of these services are transferred to
customers/insurance companies. The Company’s obligation to manage and process the claims under insurance support services can
range from 1 one to seven years. The Company receives administration fees from its customers at inception of the contract prior to
completion of transferring the services to the customer.
The
Company’s performance obligation under these contracts is to provide the above services as a stand ready obligation. The obligation
to provide insurance services lies with the insurer and the Company has no interest other than receiving the commission/management fee
retained. The Company provides the above services on behalf of the insurance companies and is accordingly considered as an agent for
the purpose of recognizing revenue.
The
Company enters into contracts with Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) primarily to administer the service
plans/extended warranty schemes launched by OEMs. The Company’s performance obligation under these contracts is to administer
these programs. The Company acts on behalf of the OEMs and is accordingly considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing
revenue, as the primary obligation to fulfill the service/extended warranty schemes belongs to the OEMs. The administration fees
received from the provision of service plan administration is recorded ratably over the tenure of contract which usually ranges from
1 one to seven years.
f) Contract assets and liabilities
A
contract asset (unbilled revenue) is the right to receive consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer.
If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due,
a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.
Contract
liabilities consist of amounts paid by the Company’s customers for which the associated performance obligations have not been satisfied
and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company’s revenue recognition criteria described above.
Contract
liabilities are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer
payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated
with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more than one year from the balance sheet date.
g) Cost of services
The
cost of services for the Company’s distribution business includes employee related expenses directly involved in generating and
servicing revenue and other direct expenses related to facilities.
For
the Company’s IaaS platform-based services cost of revenue primarily consists of direct costs incurred for delivering the services
to customers and the cost of onsite engineering support for roadside assistance, employee related expenses, risk assessment expenses
and other direct expenses. Amounts incurred towards vendors/suppliers for inspections and roadside assistance also form part of direct
cost. Cost of services also includes cost of telematics devices sold through different subscription or upfront sale model.
Cost
of services are recognized as they are incurred.

h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents primarily represent cash balances in current bank accounts. The Company considers all short-term deposits with an
original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
i) Restricted cash and cash equivalents
Restricted
cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for contractual arrangements. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as
current and noncurrent assets based on the term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash and cash equivalents to the consolidated balance sheets amounts are as follows:

Restricted cash and cash equivalents—non-current
217,064
378,993
j) Concentration of credit risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk are reflected principally in cash and cash equivalents,
investment in equity securities and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and funds with banks that have
high credit ratings, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one bank and conducts ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness
of the corporations and banks with which it does business. The Company holds cash and cash equivalent concentrations in financial institutions
around the world in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses to date related to these concentrations.
k) Accounts receivable, net
Accounts
receivables are recorded at invoice value, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, management evaluates its accounts
receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance or if any accounts should be written off based on a past history of write-offs,
collections, and current credit conditions. A receivable is considered past due if the Company has not received payments based on agreed-upon
terms.
l) Property and equipment
Property
and equipment represents the costs of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, and leasehold improvements. Property and
equipment cost also includes any costs necessarily incurred to bring assets to the condition and location necessary for its intended
use. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using
declining balance method over the assets’ estimated useful lives as follows:

Computers

years
Furniture
and fixtures
10

Leasehold
improvements related to office facilities are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
The
Company reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its property and equipment on an ongoing basis. Management is required to use
judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to
the Company’s business model, changes in the Company’s business strategy, or changes in the planned use of property and equipment
could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company’s current estimates. In cases where the Company determines that
the estimated useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended, the Company would apply the new estimated useful
life prospectively.
F-12
Roadzen
Inc.
Notes
to the consolidated financial statements
(in
US $, except share count)
The
Company reviews property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Costs
of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement
or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected
in operating expenses.
m) Intangible assets, net (including intangibles under development)
The
Company capitalizes costs incurred on its internal-use software during the application development stage as intangibles under development.
Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once the developed software
is available for intended use, capitalization ceases, and the Company estimates the useful life of the asset and begins amortization.
Internal-use
software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three
years and up to 11 eleven.
The
Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
n) Leases
The
Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC
842”). The Company elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our
prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company made a policy election not to
separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component. The Company also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
The
Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether the Company has the right to obtain
substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether it has the right to direct the use of an identified
asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which the Company does not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets
represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to
determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because
the interest rate implicit in most of its leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding
of what the Company’s credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest it would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however,
only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments
may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized
in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.
Operating
leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, short-term operating lease liabilities, current and long-term operating lease liabilities,
non-current on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and
other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases,
lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized
as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.

o) Fair value measurements and financial instruments
The
Company holds financial instruments that are measured and disclosed at fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used, and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
Level 1 inputs:
Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs:
Other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 inputs:
Unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations
in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.
The
Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the
valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The Company establishes the
fair value of its assets and liabilities using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and established a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used
to measure fair value. The recorded amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their
relatively short maturities.
p) Business combination
The
Company accounts for an acquisition as a business combination if the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction constitute
a business in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805 “Business Combinations.” Such
acquisitions are accounted using the acquisition method i.e., by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Where
the set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed do not constitute a business, it is accounted for as an asset acquisition where the
individual assets and liabilities are recorded at their respective relative fair values corresponding to the consideration transferred.

q) Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized. Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance
with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events and changes may include: significant changes
in performance related to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic trends,
and changes in our business strategy.
The
Company’s test for goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than
not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the purposes of impairment testing,
the Company determined that it has only one reporting unit.
r) Foreign currency
The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. Dollars (“USD”), the Parent Company’s functional
currency. The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in India, is the Indian Rupee (“INR”), the functional
currency of the Company’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom is the British Pound Sterling (“GBP”). The translation of
the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries into USD is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates
in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenues and expense accounts using an average exchange rate prevailing during the respective
period. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are reported as currency translation adjustments (“CTA”) under
other comprehensive income/loss, or under accumulated other comprehensive income/loss as a separate component of equity.
Monetary
assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional
currency are translated into their respective functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Transactions
of the Company and its subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency are translated
into the respective functional currencies at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period of the transaction. The gains or
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
s) Employee benefit plans
Contributions
to defined contribution plans are charged to consolidated statements of operations in the period in which services are rendered by the
covered employees. Current service costs for defined benefit plans are accrued in the period to which they relate. The liability from
defined benefit plans is calculated annually by the Company using the projected unit credit method. Prior service cost, if any, resulting
from an amendment to a plan is recognized and amortized over the remaining period of service of the covered employees.
The
Company records annual amounts relating to its defined benefit plans based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other
assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, future compensation increases and attrition rates. The Company reviews its assumptions
on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The
effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in its entirety immediately. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized
in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions.
t) Inventories
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) for all inventories.
u) Income taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates
are considered.
The
Company accounts for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions
of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.
F-15
Roadzen
Inc.
Notes
to the consolidated financial statements
(in
US $, except share count)
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and for all operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if any. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates
is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.
Future
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within
the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law.
The
Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income,
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgment regarding
future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business
plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company’s income
tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
v) Income/loss per share attributable to common shareholders
The
Company computes net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires
income available to holders of Ordinary Share for the period to be allocated between Ordinary Shares and participating securities based
upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. For the reclassified periods
prior to the Business Combination, the Roadzen (DE) convertible preferred stock is a participating security because holders of such shares
have dividend rights in the event that a cash dividend was declared on
the common stock of Roadzen (DE) at an amount equal to dividend paid on each share of Roadzen (DE) common stock. The convertible notes
of Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination and of the Company at and subsequent to the Business Combination are not considered
participating securities. The holders of the convertible preferred stock in Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination would have
been would be entitled to dividends in preference to shareholders of Roadzen (DE) common stock, at specified rates, if declared. Then
any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of Roadzen (DE) common stock and convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata
basis assuming conversion of all convertible preferred stock into common stock of Roadzen (DE).
Basic
net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) attributable to Ordinary Shares or, pre-Business Combination,
common stock of Roadzen (DE) by the weighted-average number of Ordinary Shares or, pre-Business Combination, common stock of Roadzen
(DE), outstanding during the period, without consideration of potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net income/(loss) per share is
computed by dividing the net income/(loss) attributable to Ordinary Shares or, pre-Business Combination, common stock of Roadzen (DE),
by the weighted-average number of Ordinary Shares or, pre-Business Combination, common stock of Roadzen (DE), and potentially dilutive
securities that could have been outstanding for the period.
w) Investments
Equity
securities
Equity
investments with a readily determinable fair value, other than equity method investments, are measured at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, are
measured at cost, less any impairment.
x) Commitments and contingencies
Liabilities
for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies
are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties that are probable of realization are separately
recorded as assets and are not offset against the related environmental liability.
y) Expenses
Set
forth below is a brief description of the components of the Company’s expenses:
i.Sales,
marketing and business development expense
Sales
expenses includes costs related to brokerage income which is derived from sale of insurance policies such as broker expenses, cost of
sales, promotion expense, and travel and entertainment expenses. Broker expense is the compensation paid to
our channel partners when an insurance policy is written through a broker relationship. This function also includes expenses incurred
directly or indirectly for selling and marketing a product or service and costs spent on/by personnel employed under the sales or marketing
departments and share based compensation expenses. These expenses also include marketing efforts made by the Company to expand its market
reach for distributing insurance policies. The expenses include advertisements through different mediums to reach end customers of insurance
policies to enhance awareness and educate end customers.

ii.General
and administrative expenses
General
and administrative expenses include personnel costs for corporate, finance, legal and other support staff, including bonus and share
based compensation expenses, professional fees, allowance for doubtful accounts and other corporate expenses.
iii.Research
and development expense
Research
and development expense consists of personnel costs incurred by the technology development team, subscription costs and other costs associated
with ongoing improvements to and maintenance of internally developed software, share based compensation expenses and allocation of certain
corporate costs.
z) Recently issued accounting pronouncements and not yet adopted
The
Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities
Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting
standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting
standards election, the Company will not be subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting standards as other
public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements to those
of other public companies more difficult.
i.In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other
Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s
Own Equity,” which signifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with
characteristics of liability and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts
on an entity’s own equity. The standard reduces the number of models used to account
for convertible instruments, removes certain settlement conditions that are required for
equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and requires the if-converted
method for calculation of diluted earnings per share for all convertible instruments. The
ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning on or after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier
than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
ii.In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a
business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred
revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At
the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the
acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be
applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations
for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial
statements.
iii.In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant
segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim
periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that
are currently required annually. It requires a public entity to disclose the title and position
of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this
ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company
adopted the new standard effective March 31, 2025, which impacted disclosures only, with no impact to results of operations, cash flows, or
financial condition.
iv.In
December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional
disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid.
ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using
both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including
state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible
items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold
and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose
net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as
by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023 -09
may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
aa) Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Accounting Standards Adopted
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets by requiring an allowance
to be recorded as an offset to the amortized cost of such assets. The standard primarily impacts the amortized cost of the Company’s
available-for-sale debt securities. The Company adopted this standard, which did not result in a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.

c)
$1,989,776 in advances were extended to Peoplebay Consultancy Services Private Limited, FA Events & Media Private Limited, and FA
Premium Insurance Private Limited. However, due to a loss of control over these entities during the previous year, the Company is doubtful
on the recovery of these advances and has consequently created a provision.

preferred stock of Roadzen (DE) during the financial year 2023-24 which was converted to ordinary shares upon business combination. However,
upon non receipt of the same a 100% provision of $2,800,000 was created against it.
iii)
Forward purchase agreement
On
August 25, 2023, the company entered into an agreement with (i) Meteora Capital Partners, LP (“MCP”), (ii) Meteora Select
Trading Opportunities Master, LP (“MSTO”), and
(iii)
Meteora Strategic Capital, LLC (“MSC” and, collectively with MCP and MSTO, “Seller”) (the “Forward Purchase
Agreement” or “FPA”) for OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transactions.
The
FPA represents the recognition of the cash payments to the Seller of $41.2 million (including prepayment of $41.15 million and the reimbursable
transaction cost of $0.05 million) and the FPA with regard to 3,138,628 shares (recycled shares) and 702,255 shares (FPA subscription
shares).The fair value of the FPA receivable is comprised of the Prepayment Amount (as defined in the FPA, $41.2 million) and is reduced
by the economics of the downside provided to the Sellers ($32.6 million) and the estimated consideration payment at the Cash Settlement
Payment Date ($8.6 million). During year ended March 31, 2025, an additional $1 million was received from the Seller, bringing the total
cash receipts to $4.8 million.
Following
the balance sheet date, a contractual dispute arose between the Company and the Seller, regarding alleged breaches of the terms of the
FPA. In April 2025, the Company initiated legal proceedings against the Seller, citing that despite negotiated safeguards, Meteora sold shares without honoring its payment obligations or providing the
required notices under the FPA. The
Seller subsequently filed a counterclaim, alleging breach of contract by the Company on the grounds of non-registration of FPA Subscription
shares. The dispute includes disagreement over the number of outstanding shares with the Seller as reported by the Company versus those
disclosed in the Seller’s filing of Schedule 13G/A with the Securities Exchange Commission, and the termination date of the FPA.
Due
to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the resolution of these matters and unavailability of any reliable accounting estimate as of the
reporting date, the Company has continued to value its FPA receivable on the latest available Fair Valuation report obtained before the
above-mentioned contractual dispute i.e. as of December 31, 2024. The FPA remains classified as a financial instrument, and its fair
value will be reassessed in future periods once the dispute is resolved and adequate valuation inputs are accessible.

a)
Moonshot - Internet SAS (“Moonshot”)
Roadzen
(DE) invested $2,410,000 representing 6.68% equity stake in Moonshot - Internet SAS, a simplified Joint Stock Company existing under
the laws of France, which is a subsidiary of Societe Generale. Moonshot is an InsurTech company, registered as an insurance broker, which
specializes in usage-based insurance products and services dedicated to E-Commerce. Roadzen (DE) has a representative on the board of
directors of Moonshot, however the investment of 6.68% does not give Roadzen (DE) the ability to significantly influence the operating
and financial policies of Moonshot, since majority ownership of Moonshot is concentrated with a single shareholder. Therefore, Roadzen
(DE) uses the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values for its investment in Moonshot.
The Company carries this investment at cost, less impairment.
b)
Daokang (Beijing) Data Science Company Ltd. (“Daokang”)
Roadzen
(DE) entered into a joint venture contract with WI Harper VIII LLP and Shangrao Langtai Daokang Information Technology Co. Ltd. and invested
an amount of $2,500,030 (representing a 34.5% of equity interest) of Daokang. Despite its significant equity interest in Daokang, Roadzen
(DE) has attempted but has not been able to obtain adequate financial information as per USGAAP to apply equity method. Predecessor Roadzen,
therefore, was unable to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Daokang. Accordingly, Roadzen (DE)
used the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values for its investment in Daokang. The Company
carries this investment at cost, less impairment.
The
Company evaluates its non-marketable equity securities for impairment in each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment
that considers various potential impairment indicators. This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to,
an assessment of significant adverse change in the economic environment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition
of the geographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other available financial information as per the local
reporting requirements applicable to the relevant jurisdictions that affects the value of our non-marketable equity securities.
Based on such assessment, the Company has recorded an impairment of NIL (PY. $2,140,530)
for Moonshot - Internet SAS and $1,245,326 (PY. $1,254,704)
for Daokang (Beijing) Data Science Company Ltd. till March 31, 2025.

12 Derivative warrant liabilities
Fair
valuation of warrants issued to lenders as a part of a senior secured note agreement entered into between Roadzen (DE) and Mizuho
Securities USA LLC (“Mizuho”) on June 30, 2023 (“Issuance Date”) as administrative agent amounting to $1,489,818.
Each warrant grants the holder the right to purchase one Ordinary Share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.001
with a cashless settlement option where the difference between the exercise price and the market price would be paid to the warrant
holder in the form of Ordinary Shares. Since the Company has Warrants traded under the symbol RDZNW, market price method was used to
compute the fair market value on the reporting date. The warrants issued are recognized as derivative liabilities and were initially
measured using the Black-Scholes model and are subsequently remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in
consolidated statements of operation. As per the agreement entered into, if the principal and interest payments are not made as per
the repayment schedule, the Company is obliged to issue warrants in the sequence below. On May 14, 2024, as required by the terms of
this senior secured notes agreement, the Company issued to Mizuho a warrant to purchase 1,432,517
Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.0001

Company uses a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in its determination of the fair value of its Level 1 classified
derivative warrant liabilities. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on the volatility of its ordinary share warrants,
based on implied volatility from the Company’s traded warrants and from historical volatility of select peer company’s ordinary
shares that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. For key aspects of valuation of convertible debentures refer note 13.
The
Company uses a third party valuation specialist to assist management in its determination of the fair value of its Level 3 classified
Convertible debentures and Forward Purchase Agreement. The instruments were fair valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing
assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments and current interest rates. For key aspect of the valuation inputs refer
notes 13 (c) and 5 (iii) respectively.
The
following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s Level 3 financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on

Assets
measured at Fair Value on a non-recurring basis
The
Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when
an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.
Non-Marketable
Equity Securities
The
Company measures its non-marketable equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values under the measurement alternative
at cost less impairment, adjusted by price changes from observable transactions recorded within “Other income/(expense) net”
in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held
companies without readily determinable fair values and primarily relate to its investment in Daokang and Moonshot. During the year ended
March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a impairment loss for it’s non-marketable equity securities, refer note 6.
Management
of risks
Interest
rate risk - Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to change to market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk for its long- term debts where the interest rates are
variable according to the market conditions.
Foreign
currency risk - The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures on a regular basis. The operations are primarily denominated
in United States Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Indian Rupees and Euros. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered
the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates. Based on a sensitivity analysis we have performed as of March 31, 2025, an
adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the United States Dollar would not have a material effect on our financial statements.
21 Investments
These
balances include certain investments in mutual funds that are recorded at fair value. Any changes to the fair value are recorded in “Fair
value gains/(losses) in financial instruments carried at fair value” due to the election of the fair value option of accounting
for financial instruments.

D.
Indemnifications
In
the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company agrees to provide indemnification
of varying scope and terms to customers, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including losses arising
out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties, if the Company has violated applicable laws, if the Company is
negligent or commits acts of willful misconduct, and other liabilities with respect to its products and services and its business. In
these circumstances, payment is typically conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular
contract. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities
related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements.
23 Net loss per share
Basic
net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed by dividing the net loss by the number of weighted-average outstanding
ordinary shares. Diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is determined by giving effect to all potential common
equivalents during the reporting period, unless including them yields an antidilutive result. The Company considers its preferred stocks,
convertible notes and share warrants as potential common equivalents, but excluded them from the computation of diluted net loss per
share attributable to ordinary shareholders in the periods presented, as their effect was antidilutive.
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders and preferred stock holders:

The
Company’s potential dilutive securities, which include restricted stock units, convertible instruments and share warrants have
been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be anti- dilutive. Therefore, the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same.

The
Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income,
the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgement
regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute
the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the intangible on account of business combination ability
to recover deferred tax assets, the Company’s income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment
is changed. The Company’s valuation allowance increased by $14,981,556 during the period ended March 31, 2025 and $17,429,473 during
the year ended March 31, 2024.
The
Company has not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because the
Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S.
Net
operating loss and credit carry forwards
As
of March 31, 2025, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $41,091,266 of which none are subject
to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (IRC Section 382). The federal net operating loss carry forwards that were generated
prior to the 2018 tax year will begin to expire in 2030 if not utilized. For net operating loss carry forwards arising in tax years beginning
after March 31, 2017, the tax act limits the Company’s ability to utilize carry forwards to 80% of taxable income, however, these
operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The state (Delaware) net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in
2032 if not utilized. The Company has foreign tax credits which will expire at the end of 8 years from the end of the assessment year
in which these tax credits were originated.
Utilization
of the net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of
IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the inability to fully offset future annual taxable
income and could result in the expiration of net operating loss carry forwards before utilization. The Company continually reviews the
impact to net operating losses of any ownership changes.
Unrecognized
tax benefits
The
Company has adopted authoritative guidance which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Company’s income tax return, and also
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits with a significant impact on its financial statements as of March 31, 2025 and
March 31, 2024.
The
Company’s major tax jurisdictions are India, the United Kingdom and the U.S. The U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions
have statutes of limitations that generally range from three to six years. Due to the Company’s net losses, substantially all of
its federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination for federal and state purposes.
25
Segment reporting
Operating
segments are defined as components of an entity where discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive
Officer as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of making
operating decisions, fund raising, allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has
determined that it operates in a single reporting segment.
26
Stock based compensation
The
share-based compensation awards issued under the Company’s 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan to the Company’s employees,
officers, directors, are all equity-classified instruments Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) outstanding as of March 31,
2025 have service vesting conditions up to March 2027. Compensation expenses are based on the grant-date fair value of the awards
and recognized over the requisite service period using a straight-line method for stock options and a graded vesting method for
RSUs. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of employee stock awards as they occur.
Share-based
compensation is in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs). The fair value per RSU is calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model.

compensation expense related to RSUs granted to employees was $47,211,816 for the year ended March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the
unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was approximately $260,262 which is expected to be recognized over the remaining
unvested period of RSU’s.
On
September 18, 2023, prior to the business combination, Roadzen DE granted 9,903,500 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under the 2023 Omnibus
Incentive Plan. These RSUs were initially scheduled to vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, specifically on September
17, 2024. However, the Board of Directors of Roadzen DE has subsequently decided to extend the vesting period by an additional year,
revising the vesting date to September 17, 2025. Consequently, outstanding 9,507,928 RSUs did not vest as originally anticipated on September
17, 2024.
Based
on the current market price of the shares, management has assessed that this revised vesting timeline will not result in any additional
RSU compensation expense being recognized in the company’s financial statements.
