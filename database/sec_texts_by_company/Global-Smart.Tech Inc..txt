EXPLANATORY NOTE
On August 29,
2025, we filed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025. The report of the independent accountants set forth
on page F-2 contained an error in the dates audited. This Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A is being filed solely to
include the corrected opinion. As a result, this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A has not been updated for events subsequent
to the date of the original filing, and all information contained in this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and the
original Annual Report on Form 10-K is subject to updating and supplementing as provided in the periodic reports that the Company has
filed or will file with the SEC after the original filing date.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Global-Smart.Tech Inc. as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and
cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global-Smart.Tech Inc. as of May
31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years ended May 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has an accumulated
deficit, uses cash in operations, and has recurring losses, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required
to be independent with respect to Global-Smart.Tech Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Global-Smart.Tech Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.
