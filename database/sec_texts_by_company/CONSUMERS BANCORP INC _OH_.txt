General
Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (Company) is a bank holding company as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA), and is a registered bank holding company under that act and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1994. In February 1995, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Consumers National Bank (Bank), a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America. The Company’s activities have been limited primarily to holding the common stock of the Bank.
Consumers National Bank is a community-oriented financial institution that offers a wide range of commercial and consumer loan and deposit products, as well as mortgage, financial planning and investment services to individuals, farmers and small and medium sized businesses in our markets. Since 1965, the Bank’s main office has been serving Minerva, Ohio, and surrounding areas from its location at 614 East Lincoln Way, Minerva, Ohio. The Bank seeks to be the provider of choice for financial solutions to customers who value exceptional personalized service, local decision making, and modern banking technology. The Bank’s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, and Summit counties in Ohio. Its market includes these counties as well as the contiguous counties in northeast Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank had 22 full-service branch locations and one loan production office. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies, municipal obligations, and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities. CNB Investment Co. (CNB) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank formed in November 2024 for the primary purpose of investing in municipal securities and is disclosed as part of the Bank.
Supervision and Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and other federal and state regulators.  The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Earnings and dividends of the Company are affected by state and federal laws and regulations and by policies of various regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could affect materially the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. The following describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that have, or could have, a material impact on the Company. The following discussion of supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed.
Regulation of the Company
The Bank Holding Company Act: As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the BHCA, and the examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require.
The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries and engaging in any other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to those activities. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

Privacy Provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 contains extensive provisions on a customer’s right to privacy of non-public personal information. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide its customers with the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ non-public personal information. Except in certain cases, an institution may not provide personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses that such information may be disclosed, and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. The Company and the Bank are also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of non-public personal information.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains important requirements for public companies in the areas of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, written certifications by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required. These certifications attest that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact.
Regulation of the Bank
As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). These examinations are designed primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank.
Dividend Restrictions: Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to the Company’s shareholders. There are statutory limits, however, on the amount of dividends the Bank can pay without regulatory approval. Under regulations promulgated by the OCC, the Bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its undivided profits. Additionally, the Bank may not declare a dividend if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its retained net income of that year to date, combined with its retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the dividend is approved by the OCC. The Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the federal regulations.
FDIC: The FDIC is an independent federal agency, which insures the deposits of federally insured banks and savings associations up to certain prescribed limits and safeguards the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The deposits of the Bank are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment system, the assessment rate for any insured institution varies according to regulatory capital levels of the institution and other factors such as supervisory evaluations.
The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that poses a serious threat to the insurance fund and may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution’s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may also terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Current Expected Credit Loss Model: In December 2018, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC issued a final rule to address regulatory treatment of credit loss allowances under the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The rule revised the federal banking agencies’ regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over three years the day one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model. The Bank adopted the CECL model on July 1, 2023 since it’s a smaller reporting company and elected to phase in the day-one effect of adopting CECL for regulatory capital purposes.
Risk-Based Capital Requirements: The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC employ similar risk-based capital guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and national banks, respectively. The Company meets the definition of a Small Bank Holding Company and, therefore, was exempt from maintaining consolidated regulatory capital ratios. Instead, regulatory capital ratios only apply at the subsidiary bank level. The guidelines involve a process of assigning various risk weights to different classes of assets, then evaluating the sum of the risk-weighted balance sheet structure against the capital base. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by the guidelines, the bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. In addition, failure to satisfy capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement actions by federal bank regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and a prohibition on the acceptance of “brokered deposits.”
Effective January 1, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to comply with a greater than 9% community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) requirement in lieu of the currently applicable requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets. In order to qualify for the CBLR election, a community bank must (i) have a leverage capital ratio greater than 9 percent, (ii) have less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets, (iii) not exceed certain levels of off-balance sheet exposure and trading assets plus trading liabilities and (iv) not be an advanced approaches banking organization. A community bank that meets the above qualifications and elects to utilize the CBLR is considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules and is also considered to be "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action rules. The Bank has not elected to be subject to the CBLR.
5
Unless a community bank qualifies for, and elects to comply with the CBLR beginning on January 1, 2020, national banks are required to maintain the Basel III minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations became effective on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Under Basel III, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Basel III also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which effectively resulted in a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, a total capital ratio of 10.5% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a common equity Tier 1 ratio to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
The OCC and the FDIC may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the OCC or the FDIC. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers. The OCC’s final supervisory judgment concerning an institution’s capital adequacy could differ significantly from the conclusions that might be derived from the absolute level of an institution’s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, institutions generally are expected to maintain risk-based capital ratios that exceed the minimum ratios. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices and seeks to ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. Since it was established the CFPB has exercised extensive rulemaking and interpretive authority.
Interstate Banking and Branching: The Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1995 has eased restrictions on interstate expansion and consolidation of banking operations by, among other things: (i) permitting interstate bank acquisitions regardless of host state laws, (ii) permitting interstate merger of banks unless specific states have opted out of this provision, and (iii) permitting banks to establish new branches outside the state provided the law of the host state specifically allows interstate bank branching.
Community Reinvestment Act: The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this Act, each institution is required to adopt a statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution’s efforts to assist in its community’s credit needs. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance and assigned ratings. Banking regulators consider these ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction by an institution. The Bank’s most recent CRA rating is satisfactory.
USA PATRIOT Act: In 2001, Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act). The Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the United States’ financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates that financial services companies implement additional policies and procedures with respect to additional measures designed to address any or all the following matters: money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, and currency crimes.
The Anit-Money Laundering Act: In 2021, Congress enacted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement-related and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower initiatives and protections.
6
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation: The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including applicable bank regulatory authorities not approving merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or prohibiting such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
Cybersecurity: In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack.
In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. In addition, in July 2023, the SEC issued a final rule that requires disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Under this rule, banking organizations that are SEC registrants must disclose information about any material cybersecurity incident within four business days of determining such incident is material and provide periodic updates as to the status of the incident in subsequent filings as necessary.
In November 2021, the OCC, the FRB and the FDIC issued a final rule, which became effective in May 2022, requiring banking organizations that experience a computer-security incident to notify certain entities. A computer-security incident occurs when actual or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information occurs, or there is a violation or imminent threat of a violation to banking security policies and procedures. The affected bank must notify its respective federal regulator of the computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the bank determines a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification event has occurred. These notifications are intended to promote early awareness of threats to banking organizations and will help banks react to those threats before they manifest into larger incidents. This rule also requires bank service providers to notify their bank organization customers of a computer-security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption or degradation.
Furthermore, once administrative rules are adopted by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act enacted in March 2022, will require certain covered entities, including those in the financial services industry, to report a covered cyber incident to CISA within 72 hours once the covered entity reasonably believes an incident has occurred. Separate reporting to CISA will also be required within 24 hours if a ransom payment is made as a result of a ransomware attack.
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and we are monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located.
Environmental Regulation: Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have exposure to material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or material expenditures related to environmental hazardous waste mitigation or cleanup.
The Company believes its primary exposure to environmental risk is through the lending activities of the Bank. In cases where management believes environmental risk potentially exists, we mitigate our environmental risk exposure by requiring environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites. In addition, environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral.
7
Government Monetary Policy: The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market acquisitions or dispositions of United States Government securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings and setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the interest income and interest expense of commercial banks, including the Bank, and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
Executive and Incentive Compensation: Under the Dodd-Frank Act and rules adopted by the SEC in October 2022, public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market are now required to adopt and implement “clawback” policies for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures for recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. Such clawback policies are intended to apply to compensation paid within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date the issuer is required to prepare a restatement and would cover all executives (including former executives) who received incentive awards. The Company is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market and, therefore, not required to adopt a clawback policy. However, the Company implemented a clawback policy on December 13, 2018, which was further revised and adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors effective March 12, 2024.
Employees
As of June 30, 2025, the Bank employed 178 full-time and 17 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.
Available Information
The Company files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. We file electronically with the SEC.
The Company’s reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available, free of charge, on our website (www.consumers.bank) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Item 1C—Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
Our cybersecurity risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks across various aspects of our company, including financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, and legal. Cybersecurity is a critical component of this program, given the increasing reliance on technology and the potential cyber threats. Our Chief Information Officer and Information Technology Security Officer are primarily responsible for the cybersecurity component and are key members of the risk management organization.
Our objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate, disrupt or misuse our systems or information. The structure of our information security program is designed around the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, regulatory guidance, and other industry standards. In addition, we leverage certain industry and government associations, third-party benchmarking, audits, and threat intelligence feeds to facilitate and promote program effectiveness. The information security program is periodically reviewed by personnel with the goal of addressing changing threats and conditions.
8
We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive strategy when deploying new products, services, and technology. We leverage people, processes, and technology as part of our efforts to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools designed to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on suspected advanced persistent threats. We have established processes and systems designed to mitigate cyber risk, including regular and on-going education and training for employees, preparedness simulations and tabletop exercises, and recovery and resilience tests. We engage in regular assessments of our infrastructure, software systems, and network architecture. We also maintain a third-party risk management program designed to identify, assess, and manage risks, including cybersecurity risks, associated with external service providers. We also actively monitor our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns and monitor remote connections as a portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely. We leverage internal and external auditors and independent external partners to periodically review our processes, systems, and controls, including with respect to our information security program, to assess their design and operating effectiveness and make recommendations to strengthen our risk management program.
We maintain an Incident Response Plan that provides a documented framework for responding to actual or potential cybersecurity incidents, including timely notification of and escalation to the Risk & Technology Committee of our board of directors. The Incident Response Plan is coordinated through the Information Technology Security Officer and is evaluated at least annually.
Notwithstanding our defensive measures and processes, the threat posed by cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our internal systems, processes, and controls are designed to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, while to date, we have not detected a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers.
Governance
Our Information Security Program consists of policies, procedures, risk assessments, monitoring, reporting and training to ensure the security, availability, and confidentiality of systems and customer information. The Information Security Program is led by our Information Technology Security Officer and is subject to oversight by the Risk & Technology Committee.
The Risk & Technology Committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our information security and technology programs, including management’s actions to identify, assess, mitigate, and remediate or prevent material cybersecurity issues and risks. Our Information Technology Security Officer and our Chief Information Officer provide quarterly reports to the Risk & Technology Committee of our board of directors regarding the information security and technology programs, key enterprise cybersecurity initiatives, and other matters relating to cybersecurity processes. The Risk & Technology Committee of our board of directors reviews and approves our Information Security Program and strategies annually. Additionally, the Information Technology Security Officer provides a cybersecurity report to the full board of directors at each board meeting.

Management does not have knowledge of the prices paid in all transactions and has not verified the accuracy of those prices that have been reported. Because of the lack of an established market for the Company’s common shares, these prices may not reflect the prices at which the common shares would trade in an active market.
The Company’s management is currently committed to continuing to pay regular cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent on the Company’s future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. The Company’s principal source of funds for dividend payment is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. See Note 1 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for dividend restrictions.
There were no repurchases of the Company’s securities during fiscal year 2025.

Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)
General
The following is management’s analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial position than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “may,” “continue,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “will,” “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond our control, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. Any such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report or the respective dates of the relevant incorporated documents, as the case may be, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected include, but are not limited to:
●
changes in local, regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than we expect, resulting in a deterioration in asset credit quality or debtors being unable to meet their obligations because of high unemployment rates and inflationary pressures;
●
rapid fluctuations in market interest rates could result in changes in fair market valuations and a decline in net interest income;
●
the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board;
●
changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs;
●
unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including, but not limited to, changes in the cost of liquidity, our ability to find alternative funding sources, and potential market reactions to the default or risk of default by other financial institutions;
●
the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance) with which we must comply;
●
competitive pressures on product pricing and services;
●
breaches of security or failures of our technology systems due to technological or other factors and cybersecurity threats;
●
changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;
●
declining asset values impacting the underlying value of collateral;
●
changes in accounting policies, rules and interpretations;
●
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; and
●
changes in the reliability of our vendors, internal control systems or information systems.
The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. Should any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, those developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Net Income. Net income was $8,667 for fiscal year 2025 compared with $8,580 for fiscal year 2024. The following key factors summarize our results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared with the same prior year period:
●
net interest income increased by $2,115, or 6.6%, in fiscal year 2025, primarily as a result of an increase in the yield on average interest earning assets as loans and securities repriced up to higher current market rates and due to a $40.0 million, or 3.9%, increase in average interest-earning assets;
●
a $1,137 provision for credit losses on loans and a $10 provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments were recorded during fiscal year 2025 compared with a $556 provision for credit losses on loans and a $63 provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments that were recorded during fiscal year 2024. The provision for credit losses on loans increased in fiscal year 2025 primarily due to the organic loan growth during the fiscal year;
●
noninterest income increased by $554, or 11.3%, in fiscal year 2025 from the same prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in debit card interchange income of $163, or 7.1%, and an increase in bank owned life insurance income of $113, or 40.6%; and
●
total noninterest expenses increased by $2,242, or 8.7%, in fiscal year 2025 due to increases in salaries, incentives, occupancy and equipment, and debit card processing expenses.
Return on average equity and return on average assets were 12.05% and 0.78%, respectively, for fiscal year 2025 compared with 14.95% and 0.80%, respectively, for the same period last year.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Company’s earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies, and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, can significantly affect net interest income.
Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0%. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances and average securities include unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, while yields are based on average amortized cost. In fiscal year 2024, the taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income was negative since the interest expense attributable to carrying tax exempt securities is not deductible. The taxable equivalent adjustment improved in fiscal year 2025 since the municipal securities were transferred to CNB which does not have any interest expense.

FTE net interest income for fiscal year 2025 was $34,197, an increase of $2,498 or 7.9%, from $31,699 in fiscal year 2024. The Company’s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.15% for fiscal year 2025 and 3.00% for fiscal year 2024. FTE interest income for fiscal year 2025 was $53,139, an increase of $4,214, or 8.6%, from fiscal year 2024, primarily because of a 26-basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets and a $39,977, or 3.9%, increase in average interest-earning assets from fiscal year 2024. The Company’s yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.90% for fiscal year 2025 compared with 4.64% for the same period last year. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased as loans and securities repriced up to higher current market rates and the tax-equivalent yield on nontaxable securities was positively impacted in fiscal year 2025 by the transfer of municipal bonds to CNB.
Interest expense for fiscal year 2025 was $18,942, an increase of $1,716 from fiscal year 2024. Interest expense increased primarily because of an increase in the cost of savings deposits, which includes money market accounts that have seen the largest increase in rates. Also, interest expense was impacted by a $31,220, or 4.1%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The Company’s average cost of funds was 2.37% for fiscal year 2025 compared with 2.25% for the same prior year period.

Non-accrual loan balances are included for purposes of computing the rate and volume effects although interest on these balances has been excluded.
Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses on loans represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses on loans to a level considered appropriate by management to absorb estimated losses over the expected life of loans. The provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit.
A provision for credit losses on loans of $1,137 was recorded in fiscal year 2025 compared with $556 in fiscal year 2024. The increase in the provision for expected credit losses on loans recorded in fiscal year 2025 was primarily due to the organic growth and a change in loan mix within the loan portfolio. The Commercial & Industrial loan segment includes a third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit that had an outstanding balance of zero as of June 30, 2025 compared with $26,159 as of June 30, 2024. The warehouse line-of-credit did not have any allowance for credit losses allocated to it in 2025 because of the unique structure and historical performance of this relationship and because this line-of-credit was replaced with other loans that received an allowance allocation at the time of origination. In the Commercial Real Estate loan segment, the provision declined primarily because of a reduction to the calculated loss rate. For each portfolio segment, the forecasted loss rate is determined by using peer and economic data from prior economic cycles to develop regression models.
For fiscal year 2025, net charge-offs of $597, or 0.07% of total loans, were recorded compared with $402, or 0.05% of total loans, for the same period last year. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.04% at June 30, 2025 and 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was stable between the two periods since the forecasted unemployment rate projections remained within a relatively narrow range. The economy has remained resilient through the rapid rise in short-term interest rates and the recent changes in trade policies.
Non-performing loans were $1,031, or 0.11% of total loans, as of June 30, 2025. This compared with $858, or 0.10% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024. Non-performing loans have been considered in management’s analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor these loans and believe the prospect for recovery of principal, less identified specific reserves, are favorable. As of June 30, 2025, loans classified as special mention were $15,750, compared with $4,455 as of June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily related to one commercial customer because of a combination of a delay in a construction project and reduced revenue in the industry. The construction project for this commercial customer is now complete and operations have commenced in the new building, a portion of the property is being leased out, and the customer has implemented cost saving measures which are all expected to improve its financial performance. Also, the real estate secured position on this credit is further improved by existing and approved/pending Small Business Administration 504 debentures. Uncertainty remains regarding future levels of criticized and classified loans, non-performing loans and charge-offs. Management will continue to closely monitor changes in the loan portfolio and will work with borrowers as needed to mitigate losses to the Company.

Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income increased by $554, or 11.3%, to $5,450 for fiscal year 2025. Debit card interchange income increased by $163, or 7.1% in fiscal year 2025 because of an increase in customer usage. Bank owned life insurance income increased by $113, or 40.6%, because of the purchase of a new life insurance policy during fiscal year 2025. Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $61, or 3.6%, in fiscal year 2025 primarily because of an increase in new commercial deposit customers and an increase in the usage of our cash management products by our existing business customers. Mortgage banking revenue increased by $53, or 15.3%.
Noninterest Expenses. Total noninterest expenses were $28,086 for the year ended June 30, 2025; an increase of $2,242, or 8.7%, from $25,844 for the year ended June 30, 2024.
Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $1,175, or 8.2%, during fiscal year 2025 primarily due to merit and cost of living increases and higher sales and incentive expenses.
Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $279, or 8.1%, in fiscal year 2025 because of investments in new software, increases in software licensing fees, and increases in building maintenance and repair expenses. Professional and director fees increased by $257, or 24.9%, primarily because of an increase in director fees due to the accrual for a restricted stock award and due to higher legal fees. Debit card processing expenses increased by $175, or 14.2%, in fiscal year 2025 compared to the same prior year period primarily because of an increase in customer card usage and an increase in fees. Financial institution tax expenses increased by $74, or 17.1%, in fiscal year 2025 since this is a capital-based tax and total capital was higher as of the measurement date in fiscal year 2025.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense totaled $1,657 and $1,845 and the effective tax rates were 16.0% and 17.7% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax expense was calculated utilizing a statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate as a result of tax-exempt income from obligations of states and political subdivisions, loans, bank owned life insurance earnings, and the low-income housing tax credits.
Financial Condition
Total assets as of June 30, 2025 were $1.17 billion compared with $1.10 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $67,919, or 6.2%. The growth in total assets is mainly attributable to an increase of $54,344, or 7.2%, in total loans that was funded by a $63,838, or 6.6%, increase in total deposits.
Securities. Total securities were $279,042 at June 30, 2025, of which $273,875 were classified as available-for-sale and $5,167 were classified as held-to-maturity. The securities portfolio is mainly comprised of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government sponsored entities and obligations of state and political subdivisions.

The weighted average interest rates are based on coupon rates for securities purchased at par value and on effective yields considering amortization or accretion if the securities were purchased at a premium or discount. The weighted average yield on tax-exempt obligations has been calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Average yields are based on amortized cost balances.
Loans. Loan receivables increased by $54,344, or 7.2%, to $813,458 at June 30, 2025 compared to $759,114 at June 30, 2024. Commercial & industrial loans decreased by $14,298 primarily because of a third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit that had a balance of $26,159 as of June 30, 2024 that was paid down to zero as of June 30, 2025. The paydown was a result of lower mortgage volume due to higher mortgage rates and the funding needs of the lead bank. The outstanding balance of this line-of-credit is expected to increase in future periods if mortgage volume increases and as the funding needs of the lead bank changes. Consumer loans increased by $39,642, or 54.5%, because of the expansion of indirect auto lending within our market areas.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The determination of the balance of the allowance for credit losses is based on the CECL methodology and utilizes a lifetime “expected credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity securities and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to cover credit losses currently expected over the weighted average life of each loan segment.
The ACL consists of general and specific components. The general component covers loans collectively evaluated for credit loss and is based on peer historical loss experience adjusted for current and forecasted factors. Management's adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be for trends in delinquencies, trends in the volume of loans, changes in underwriting standards, changes in the value of underlying collateral, the existence and effect of portfolio concentration, regulatory environment, economic conditions, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company’s loan review function.
The specific component includes loans that do not share similar risk characteristics that are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the pooling approach. As of June 30, 2025, individually evaluated loans totaled $930 and there was a specific reserve of $52 allocated to these individually evaluated loans. As of June 30, 2024, individually evaluated loans totaled $26,933 and included the $26,159 third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit and $774 of nonaccrual loans. The warehouse line-of-credit is included in individually evaluated loans because of the unique structure of the loan given the short-term nature of the advances, curtailment features provided by the financial institution that the line-of-credit is issued to, as well as being secured by individual residential properties. As of June 30, 2024, there was a specific reserve of $67 allocated to the individually evaluated loans.
Failure to receive principal and interest payments when due on any loan results in efforts to restore such loan to a current status. Loans are classified as non-accrual when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and accrued interest is not expected. The loans must be brought and kept current for six sustained payments before being considered for removal from non-accrual status. Occasionally, loans to borrowers in financial distress are modified by providing principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay. If principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. One concession or multiple types of concessions may be provided on one loan. There were no modifications of loans to borrowers in financial distress completed during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Continued unsuccessful collection efforts generally lead to initiation of foreclosure or other legal proceedings.

While management’s periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loan situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-off that may occur. While the Company has historically experienced strong trends in asset quality, an increase in the provision could occur if economic conditions and factors which affect credit quality, real estate values and general business conditions worsen. Management closely monitors changes in the existing loan portfolio and analyzes potential loan opportunities carefully in order to manage credit risk.
Deposits. Total deposits increased by $63,838 or 6.6%, from $972,980 at June 30, 2024 to $1.04 billion at June 30, 2025. As of June 30, 2025, the Company maintained a favorable funding mix with 23.1% of total deposits in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, 14.8% in interest-bearing demand deposits, 36.6% in savings and money market deposits, and 25.5% in certificates and other time deposits.

Repurchase agreements are financing arrangements with local customers that mature daily. The Bank pledges securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve’s Bank Term Funding Program was a facility established in 2023 in response to liquidity concerns within the banking industry, the program ceased making new loans in March 2024, and the outstanding balance of this loan was repaid in November 2024. A line of credit from another financial institution was established since the Company does not conduct operations and its primary sources of liquidity are dividend upstreams from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources. As of June 20, 2025, the available credit on the Company’s line of credit was $5,000. See Note 7—Short-Term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information concerning short-term borrowings.
Capital Resources
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $12,586 from $63,685 as of June 30, 2024 to $76,271 at June 30, 2025. The primary reason for the increase in shareholders’ equity was because of net income of $8,667 for fiscal year 2025 and a decrease of $5,778 in the accumulated other comprehensive loss from the mark-to-market of available-for-sale securities which were partially offset by $2,383 in cash dividends paid. The total accumulated other comprehensive loss was $22,554 as of June 30, 2025 and $28,332 as of June 30, 2024. Available-for-sale securities and shareholders’ equity were impacted by rapidly rising interest rates during 2022 and 2023 causing the accumulated other comprehensive loss to increase as available-for-sale securities are marked to fair market value. As market interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decline with a corresponding net of tax decline recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss portion of equity. This unrealized loss in securities is temporary and is adjusted monthly for additional market interest rate fluctuations, principal paydowns, calls, and maturities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such securities decline. The Company has significant sources of liquidity and therefore does not expect to have to sell securities to fund growth.
For fiscal year 2025, the average equity to average total assets ratio was 6.44% and the dividend payout ratio was 27.5%. For fiscal year 2024, the average equity to average total assets ratio was 5.35% and the dividend payout ratio was 26.2%.

At June 30, 2025, management believes the Bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements. Based on the Bank’s computed regulatory capital ratios, the OCC has determined the Bank to be well capitalized under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act as of its latest exam date. The Bank’s actual and required capital amounts are disclosed in Note 12-Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management is not aware of any matters occurring subsequent to that exam that would cause the Bank’s capital category to change.
At June 30, 2025, the Company had no unconsolidated, related special purpose entities, nor did the Company engage in hedging contracts, such as interest rate swaps, which may expose the Company to liabilities greater than the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s investment policy prohibits engaging in derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes; however, in the future, the Company may pursue certain contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to execute a sound and defensive interest rate risk management policy.
Liquidity
Management considers the asset position of the Bank to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Bank’s earning assets are divided primarily between loans and available-for-sale securities, with any excess funds placed in federal funds sold or interest-bearing deposit accounts with other financial institutions.
For fiscal year 2025, net cash inflows from operating activities were $7,934, net cash inflows from financing activities were $55,948 and net cash outflows from investing activities were $61,697. Major sources of cash were a $63,838 net increase in deposits and $38,548 in cash received from maturities, calls, and principal pay downs of available-for-sale securities. Major uses of cash were a $55,017 net increase in loans and $40,292 purchases of available-for-sale securities. Total cash and cash equivalents were $19,908 as of June 30, 2025 compared to $17,723 at June 30, 2024.
The Bank groups its loan portfolio into six major categories: commercial & industrial loans; commercial real estate loans; farmland loans; land development loans; 1-4 family residential real estate loans; and consumer loans. The Bank’s 1-4 family residential real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans with amortization periods up to thirty years, residential construction loans with a fixed rate interest only period of up to 18-months that converts to a fixed or variable rate loan with amortization periods of up to thirty years, and variable rate home equity lines of credit. Commercial & industrial, commercial real estate loans, and farmland loans are comprised of both variable rate notes subject to interest rate changes based on the prime rate or Treasury index, and fixed rate notes having maturities of generally not greater than twenty years. Land development loans are adjustable-rate loans with interest only periods generally up to three years. Consumer loans offered by the Bank are generally written for periods of up to seven years, based on the nature of the collateral. These may be either installment loans having regular monthly payments or demand type loans for short periods of time.
Funds not allocated to the Bank’s loan portfolio are invested in various securities having diverse maturity schedules. Most of the Bank’s securities are held in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored entities, mortgage-backed securities, and investments in tax-exempt municipal bonds.
The Bank offers several forms of deposit products to its customers. We believe the rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with others currently available in the market area. While the Bank continues to be under competitive pressures in the Bank’s market area as financial institutions attempt to attract and keep new deposits, we believe many commercial and retail customers are turning to community banks. Compared to our peers, the Company’s core deposits consist of a larger percentage of noninterest-bearing demand deposits resulting in a lower cost of funds of 2.37% for fiscal year 2025.
Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of $250 and over) were $74,683 and $59,233 at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These deposits are monitored closely by the Bank and typically priced on an individual basis. When these deposits are from a municipality, certain bank-owned securities are pledged to guarantee the safety of these public fund deposits as required by Ohio law.
The Company has the option to use a third-party broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding, however, these deposits are not relied upon as a primary source of funding. As of June 30, 2025, there were $1,420 of brokered deposits within savings deposits that were used to fund the seasonal decline of public fund deposits. There were $6,004 of brokered deposits as of June 30, 2024.
To provide additional sources of liquidity, the Company has lines of credit with other financial institutions and has entered into agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. As of June 30, 2025, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled $22,551 compared with $13,709 as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $86,330 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The Company considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base. In addition, at June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $91,626 in securities unencumbered by a pledge that could be used to support additional borrowings, as needed, through the Federal Reserve discount window.
22
Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends the Bank can pay without regulatory approval. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. Additionally, the Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the federal regulations. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank could, without prior approval, declare a dividend of approximately $17,085.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations primarily in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. Therefore, as a financial institution, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. The liquidity, maturity structure and quality of the Company’s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates
The financial condition and results of operations for the Company presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and management’s discussion and analysis are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Company’s accounting policies. The selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined.
Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. In the event different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending upon the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Management has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACL). The determination of the ACL on loans involves considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. The ACL is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management’s best estimate of all expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ACL calculation is performed and evaluated quarterly, and losses are estimated over the expected life of the loan. The level of the ACL is believed to be adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the measurement date.
In calculating the ACL, the loan portfolio was pooled into loan segments with similar risk characteristics. The general component covers loans collectively evaluated for credit loss and is based on peer historical loss experience adjusted for current and forecasted factors.
The Company qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not inherently captured in the general component but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit losses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor. Management's adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be for trends in delinquencies, trends in the volume of loans, changes in underwriting standards, changes in the value of underlying collateral, the existence and effect of portfolio concentration, regulatory environment, economic conditions, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company’s loan review function.
In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within the loan segments. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the general component. Specific reserves in the ACL are determined by analyzing the borrower's ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower's industry, among other things. A loan is considered collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact the Company’s financial condition or earnings in future periods.
23
Goodwill. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no additional testing is required, and an impairment loss is not recorded. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, further valuation procedures are performed that could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded. Further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Management evaluated goodwill as of April 30, 2025, the measurement date, utilizing an income approach that incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involved management assumptions based upon future growth and earnings projections. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was then compared to the current carrying value to determine if impairment had occurred. It is our opinion that, as of the measurement date, the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Therefore, management concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may vary significantly and it is impossible to know the future impact of evolving economic conditions. If for any future period it is determined that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances, the Company will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk-based capital ratios.

Item 8— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Consumers Bancorp, Inc.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumers Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Collectively Evaluated Loans - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Management’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) includes a reserve on collectively evaluated loans. The reserve on collectively evaluated loans is based on historical loss rates adjusted for changes in the forecast period and qualitative factors. In defining historical loss rates, the Company utilized regional peer data. Significant assumptions in management’s estimate of the reserve on collectively evaluated loans include (i) the peer group utilized to determine historic loss rates; (ii) the loss drivers utilized to project losses during the forecast period; and (iii) qualitative factor adjustments. Management’s consideration for qualitative factor adjustments include internal and external qualitative and credit risk adjustments, such as economic conditions and trends in volume, delinquencies and underlying collateral valuation.
25
Significant judgment was required by management in the selection and application of subjective assumptions used to derive the quantitative portion of the ACL. Accordingly, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s estimated ACL involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s estimate of the ACL included, but were not limited to, the following:
●
Obtaining an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL on collectively evaluated loans.
●
Evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology used for estimating the ACL on collectively evaluated loans.
●
Testing the completeness and accuracy of data utilized by management.
●
Evaluating the relevance and reliability of information used by management in the development of the estimate.
●
Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used in management’s estimate through a combination of the following:
o
Consideration of whether assumptions used were reasonable given portfolio composition; relevant external factors, including economic conditions; and consideration of historical or recent experience and conditions and events affecting the Company.
o
Developing an independent expectation by establishing a range of reasonable outcomes for the overall collectively evaluated component of the ACL estimate.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2025 and 2024
(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)
NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Consumers National Bank (Bank), together referred to as the Company. CNB Investment Co. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank that was formed in November 2024 for the primary purpose of investing in municipal securities and is disclosed as part of the Bank. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Nature of Operations: Consumers Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in Minerva, Ohio that provides, through its banking subsidiary, a broad array of products and services throughout its primary market area of Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, and Summit counties in Ohio. Its market includes these counties as well as the contiguous counties in northeast Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. The Bank’s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its primary market area.
Business Segment Information: The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07) as of January 1, 2025. The Company's operations have been evaluated for segment reporting and management has determined operations are managed along one operating segment, banking. While the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) monitors the revenue streams of the Company’s various products and services, operations are managed, and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. The Company has determined that all of its financial service operations meet the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, Segment Reporting, as its current operating model is structured whereby financial service operations serve a similar base of retail and commercial customers utilizing a company-wide offering of similar products and services managed through similar processes that are collectively reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the CODM. Therefore, all the Company’s financial service operations are considered by the CODM to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment.
Our CODM evaluates interest and noninterest income streams and credit losses from our various products and services, while expense activities, including interest expense and noninterest expense, are managed, and financial performance is evaluated, on a Company-wide basis. As a result, detailed profitability information for each interest and noninterest income stream is not used to allocate resources or in assessing performance. Rather, the CODM uses consolidated net income to assess performance by comparing it to and monitoring it against budgeted and prior year results. This information is used to manage resources to drive business and net income growth, including investment in key strategic priorities, as well as to determine our ability to return capital to shareholders. Segment assets represent total assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and segment net income represents net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income. All the Company's earnings relate to its operations within the United States.
Acquisition: At the date of acquisition the Company records the assets and liabilities of acquired companies on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value. The results of operations for acquired companies are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income beginning at the acquisition date. Expenses arising from acquisition activities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the periods incurred.
Use of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash, deposits with other financial institutions with original maturities of less than 90 days and federal funds sold.  Cash flows are reported on a net basis for customer loan and deposit transactions, interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and short-term borrowings.
Interest–Bearing Deposits in Other Financial Institutions: Interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions mature within one year and are carried at cost.
Securities: Debt securities are generally classified into either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale categories. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and are those management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are those management may decide to sell before maturity if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management, or other reasons. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of equity, net of tax.
32
Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations where prepayments are anticipated. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.
The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest income from the amortized cost basis of debt securities and report accrued interest separately in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time we no longer expect to receive all contractual amounts due, which is generally at 90 days past due. Accrued interest for a security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Accordingly, we do not recognize an allowance for credit loss against accrued interest receivable.
Allowance for Credit Losses – Held-to-Maturity (HTM) Debt Securities: The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. Any allowance for credit losses on HTM securities would be a contra asset valuation account that would be deducted from the carrying amount of HTM securities to present the net amount expected to be collected and would be charged off against the allowance for credit losses when deemed uncollectible. Adjustments
to the allowance for credit losses would be reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income in the provision for credit losses. Since all the HTM securities are non-rated municipal securities to local customers, management considers the financial condition of the issuer and whether the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities.
Allowance for Credit Losses – Available-for-Sale (AFS) Debt Securities: For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, management determines whether the Company intends to sell or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS securities with unrealized losses not meeting these criteria, management evaluates whether any decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the allowance when the collectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.
Equity Securities: Equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.
Federal Bank and Other Restricted Stocks: The Bank is a member of its regional Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB system. FHLB members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors and may invest in additional amounts. Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, included with Federal bank and other restricted stocks on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Since these stocks are viewed as a long-term investment, impairment is based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
Loans Held for Sale: Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights released. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold.
33
Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. The fair value of the interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage loan is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking activity income.
Loans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The recorded investment in loans includes accrued interest receivable.
Interest income on commercial and mortgage loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due unless the loan is in the process of collection. Past due status is determined by the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.
All interest accrued but not received on loans placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when the customer has exhibited the ability to repay and demonstrated this ability over at least a consecutive six-month period and future payments are reasonably assured.
Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments: Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when funded.
Concentrations of Credit Risk: The Bank grants consumer, real estate, and commercial loans primarily to borrowers in Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, Summit, and contiguous counties in Ohio. Therefore, the Company’s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in these counties. Automobiles and other consumer assets, business assets and residential and commercial real estate secure most loans.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans: The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis and established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. When a loan or portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the portion deemed uncollectible is charged against the allowance and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses.
The allowance balance is estimated using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience of our peer group provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments.
The allowance for credit losses consists of general and specific components. The general component includes loans with similar risk characteristics that are collectively evaluated for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses for the general portfolio segments is evaluated based upon periodic quantitative review of the collectability of the loans that correlates historical loss experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (loss rate, expected loss) method to estimate the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses for all portfolio segments.
For each portfolio segment, a loss driver analysis (LDA) is performed to identify appropriate loss indicators and create a regression model for use in forecasting cash flows. The LDA analysis utilizes peer data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (FFIEC) Call Report data for all segments. The Company has established a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period with a one-year straight-line reversion to the long-term historical average. Key inputs into the discounted cash flow model include loan-level detail, including the amortized cost basis of individual loans, payment structure, and forecasted loss drivers. Since the Company has had very limited loss experience, management elected to utilize benchmark peer loss history data to estimate historical loss rates. Management worked with a third-party advisory firm to identify an appropriate peer group for each loan segment that shares similar characteristics. The Company uses the central tendency seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate forecast from the FOMC for all portfolio segments. Other key assumptions include a maturity assumption for loans without maturity dates and prepayment / curtailment rates specific to each loan segment. Prepayment and curtailment rates are calculated based on the Company’s own data.
34
The Company has identified six portfolio segments of loans including Commercial & Industrial, Commercial Real Estate, Farmland, Land Development, 1 – 4 Family Residential Real Estate, and Consumer loans. Each segment has a distinct set of risk characteristics that are monitored by management. Below are the risk characteristics of the loan segments.
Commercial & Industrial: Commercial & Industrial loans are made for a wide variety of general business purposes, including financing for equipment, inventories and accounts receivable. The term of each commercial loan varies by its purpose. Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Current and projected cash flows are evaluated to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and usually incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The commercial loan portfolio includes loans to a wide variety of corporations and businesses across many industrial classifications, including agriculture, primarily in the areas where the Bank operates.
Commercial Real Estate: Commercial real estate loans include mortgage loans to owners of owner-occupied commercial properties, commercial investment properties, and multi-family investment properties as well as loans originated to finance the construction of owner occupied and investment properties. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Current and projected cash flows are evaluated to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Loans secured by existing commercial real estate have fixed or variable rates with amortization periods of up to 25 years.
Commercial construction loans generally adjust with the prime rate during the construction period and may convert to amortizing loans with maturities up to 25 years. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant, and regular inspections are required to monitor the progress of construction through completion. The property owner’s and/or guarantor’s financial strength, expertise, credit history, and the projected cash flow of the property are considered during underwriting of construction loans. Construction financing is considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, there may not be sufficient funds to complete the project, or a completed project with an insufficient value to assure full repayment. We attempt to reduce such risks on construction loans by including a contingency amount in the financing package, through inspections of construction progress on the property, by reviewing the owner’s financial strength, the success of the owners’ and / or contractor’s past projects, and by requiring personal guarantees of the owners.
Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and are primarily located in our immediate and surrounding market area. This diversity helps reduce the Company’s exposure to adverse economic events that may affect any single market or industry. The three largest collateral concentrations within the commercial real estate non-owner-occupied portfolio are retail rental, office rental, and nursing home/assisted living facilities. The office rental segment includes a high percentage of medical facilities that require special build outs that would make it more costly for a tenant to change locations. Also, personal guarantees are typically obtained on commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are originated primarily in the area in which the bank operates. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria.
Farmland: Farmland loans include loans to finance or refinance the acquisition or improvement of land used for agricultural purposes. The loans are secured by mortgages on the land and buildings, contain fixed and variable rates, and amortize over periods up to 30 years. The portfolio is concentrated within the bank’s primary market area and is diversified across a number of agricultural segments with grain, dairy, and beef cattle operations comprising the largest segments. Current and projected cash flows are evaluated to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Agriculture lending is largely dependent on the successful management and operation of the farm and may be adversely affected by volatile commodity prices, weather, rising farm production costs, and fluctuating land value.
35
Land Development: Land Development loans include loans to finance the land acquisition and the infrastructure improvements necessary to develop saleable residential lots located within our primary market area. Land development loans are adjustable-rate loans with interest only periods generally up to three years. Principal payments are tied to the sale of the developed lots to related or third-party residential builders, or individual borrowers. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as development progresses and as inspections warrant, and regular inspections are required to monitor the progress of development through completion. In underwriting construction loans, we consider the property owner’s and/or guarantor’s financial strength, expertise, credit history, and the projected cash flow of the saleable lots.
Land development financing is considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved real estate. Risk of loss on a development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of development costs and of the respective values of the completed lots. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. We attempt to reduce such risks on development loans by including a contingency amount in the financing package, through inspections of construction progress on the property, by reviewing the developers financial strength and past projects, and requiring personal guarantees.
1-4 Family Residential Real Estate: Residential real estate loans are secured by one to four family residential properties and include owner occupied, non-owner occupied, construction, and home equity loans. Credit approval for residential real estate loans requires demonstration of sufficient income to repay the principal and interest and the real estate taxes and insurance, stability of employment, an established credit record and an appropriately appraised value of the real estate securing the loan that generally requires that the residential real estate loan amount be no more than 85% of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan unless the borrower purchases private mortgage insurance. Residential mortgage loans to purchase or refinance existing homes are fixed or variable rate and contain amortization periods of up to thirty years. Residential construction loans are secured by mortgages on the subdivided lot, have a fixed rate interest only period of up to 18-months, and may convert to a fixed or variable rate loan with amortization periods of up to thirty years.
Consumer: The Company originates direct and indirect consumer loans, primarily automobile loans, personal lines of credit, and unsecured consumer loans in its primary market areas. Credit approval for consumer loans requires income sufficient to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, an established credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances as compared to real estate mortgage loans, and generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances and economic conditions. Consumer loans generally have fixed rates and amortization periods up to 84 months.
In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within the loan segments. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the general component. Specific reserves in the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower's ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower's industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated on a quarterly basis.
Individually evaluated loans include the third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit, nonaccrual loans, modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and other loans deemed appropriate by management. Specific reserves on non-performing loans are typically based on management’s best estimate of the fair value of collateral securing these loans, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.
The Company qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not inherently captured in the general component but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit losses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor. Management's adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be for trends in delinquencies, trends in the volume of loans, changes in underwriting standards, changes in the value of underlying collateral, the existence and effect of portfolio concentration, regulatory environment, economic conditions, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company’s loan review function.
36
Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures: The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if the Company has the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur, and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the income statement as a component of provision for credit losses.
Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): The Company has invested in LIHTCs through funds that assist corporations in investing in limited partnerships and limited liability companies that own, develop and operate low-income residential rental properties for purposes of qualifying for the LIHTCs. These investments are accounted for under the proportional amortization method which recognizes the amortization of the investment in proportion to the tax credit and other tax benefits received.
Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets Owned: Real estate properties and other repossessed assets, which are primarily vehicles, acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of acquisition, establishing a new cost basis. Any reduction to fair value from the carrying value of the related loan at the time of acquisition is accounted for as a loan loss. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If the fair value declines after acquisition, a valuation allowance is recorded as a charge to income. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposition are reported as a charge to income.
Transfers of Financial Assets: Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.
Premises and Equipment: Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, generally over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease facility or the estimated economic life of the improvement. Useful lives range from three years for software to thirty-nine and one-half years for buildings.
Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance: The Bank has purchased single-premium life insurance policies to insure the lives of current and former participants in the salary continuation plan. As of June 30, 2025, the Bank had policies with total death benefits of $23,474 and total cash surrender values of $13,266. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank had policies with total death benefits of $19,215 and total cash surrender values of $10,500. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Tax-exempt income is recognized from the periodic increases in cash surrender value of these policies.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Core deposit intangible assets arise from whole bank or branch acquisitions and are measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed at least annually for impairment. Any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. The Company has selected April 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company’s balance sheet.
Long-Term Assets: Premises, equipment and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.
Repurchase Agreements: Substantially all repurchase agreement liabilities, which are classified as short-term borrowings, represent amounts advanced by various customers. Securities are pledged to cover these liabilities, which are not covered by federal deposit insurance.
Retirement Plans: The Bank maintains a 401(k) savings and retirement plan covering all eligible employees and matching contributions are expensed as made. Salary continuation plan expense allocates the benefits over years of service.
Income Taxes: The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Income tax expense is the sum of the current-year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Earnings per Common Share: Basic earnings per common share is net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock awards.
Stock-Based Compensation: Compensation cost is recognized for restricted stock awards issued to employees over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated by using the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred.
Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, which are also recognized as a separate component of equity, net of tax.
Loss Contingencies: Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable, and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are such matters that will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, discounted cash flows, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
Dividend Restrictions: Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to the June 30, 2024 financial statements to be comparable to the June 30, 2025 presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on prior year net income or shareholders’ equity.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective: In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-06 Disclosure Improvements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative (ASU 2023-06). The amendments in this ASU are the result of FASB’s decision to incorporate into the Accounting Standards Codification certain disclosure requirements, referred by the SEC, for incremental information to US GAAP. Topics in the ASU that have applicability to the Company are (1) Statement of Cash Flows which requires an accounting policy disclosure in annual periods of where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and losses are presented in the statement of cash flows, (2) Debt which requires disclosure of amounts and terms of unused lines of credit and unfunded commitments and the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding short-term borrowings, and (3) Derivatives and Hedging which adds cross-reference to disclosure requirements related to where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and losses are presented in the statement of cash flows.
The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Accounting Standards Codification and will not become effective for any entity. Management is reviewing the provisions of ASU 2023-06, and does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
In December 2023, FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). FASB issued ASU 2023-09 to address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is to be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-09 will impact income tax disclosures, and the Company does not expect a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
38
In November 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-03 Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40). The amendments in this update require disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period (1) the Company disclose the amounts of (a) employee compensation, (b) depreciation, and (c) intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that contains any of the expense categories listed; (2) include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current generally accepted accounting principles in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements; (3) disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively; (4) disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, the Company’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this update or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the update and does not expect adoption of the update to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal Year 2025: In November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (ASU 2023-07). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 apply to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. Public entities are required to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. In addition, public entities must provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting in interim periods. The amendments clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements. The amendments require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Finally, the amendments require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in ASU 2023-07 and all existing segment disclosures in ASC Topic 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity that adopts ASU 2023-07 is required to apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-07, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on January 1, 2025 with little impact as currently the Company's financial service operations are aggregated into one reportable operating segment.

As of June 30, 2025, there were 427 available-for-sale securities, of which 369 were in an unrealized loss position. Also, there were three held-to-maturity securities all of which were in an unrecognized loss position as of June 30, 2025. The Company evaluates all securities in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis to determine if an ACL and corresponding impairment charge should be recorded. Consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value of the amortized cost. No ACL was recorded in the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.
The Company’s mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s municipal bond portfolio consists of tax-exempt and taxable general obligation and revenue bonds to a broad range of counties, towns, school districts, and other essential service providers. As of June 30, 2025, 97.4% of the municipal bonds held in the available-for-sale portfolio had an S&P or Moody’s investment grade rating, and 2.6% were non-rated issues. The municipal bonds in the held-to-maturity portfolio are all non-rated issues to local entities that are also deposit customers. The other debt securities consist of subordinated notes issued by other bank holding companies. The issuers of all securities owned by the Company continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the securities’ contractual terms. The unrealized losses related to these securities have not been recognized into income because the decline in fair value is not attributed to credit quality, management does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not likely that management will be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The unrealized losses on these securities are primarily due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased and increased credit spreads. The securities’ fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company owned equity securities with an amortized cost of $400. The following table presents the net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities recognized in earnings for the twelve months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. There were no realized gains or losses on the sale of equity securities during the periods presented.

Credit Quality Indicators:
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, current economic trends and other relevant information. At the time of origination, the Company analyzes all commercial loans individually and classifies the loans by credit risk. Management regularly monitors commercial loans for any changes in the borrowers’ ability to service their debt and completes an annual review to confirm the risk rating for those loans with total outstanding loan relationships greater than $500. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
Pass. Loans classified as pass exhibit a wide array of characteristics but at a minimum represent minimal level of risk and are considered collectable. Borrowers in this rating may have leveraged but acceptable balance sheet positions, satisfactory asset quality, stable to favorable sales and earnings trends, acceptable liquidity, and adequate cash flow. While generally adhering to credit policy, these loans may exhibit occasional exceptions that do not result in undue risk. Borrowers are generally capable of absorbing setbacks, financial and otherwise.
Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Not Rated. Loans listed as not rated are included in groups of homogeneous loans. Past due information is the primary credit indicator for groups of homogenous loans.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to maximize collection of loan balances by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than insignificant payment delay, or an interest rate reduction. In some cases, the Company may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. If principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. There were no modifications of loans to borrowers in financial distress completed during the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2025 or 2024.
Collateral Dependent Loans
A loan is considered collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The following table presents the amortized cost of collateral dependent loans and the related allowance for credit losses allocated to these loans:

As of June 30, 2025, the Company leased real estate for seven office locations and various equipment under operating lease agreements. The lease agreements have maturity dates ranging from one year or less to May 31, 2035, including extension periods. Lease agreements for three locations have a lease term of 12 months or less and are therefore considered short-term leases. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at our sole discretion. Most renewals to extend the lease terms are included in our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as they are reasonably certain of exercise. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the fully collateralized FHLB borrowing rate, commensurate with the lease terms based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average remaining life of the lease term for the leases with a term over 12 months was 6.61 years as of June 30, 2025 and the weighted-average discount rate was 1.85%.
Rent expense for all the operating leases was $230 and $245 for the twelve-month periods ending June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, the right-of-use asset, included in premises and equipment, was $647 and the lease liability, included in other liabilities, was $677.

Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. For the goodwill impairment analysis, the Company is the only reporting unit. Management performed a quantitative impairment assessment as of April 30, 2025. The assessment estimated fair value on an income approach that incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involved management assumptions based upon future growth and earnings projections. The results of the assessment indicated no impairment as of the measurement date. Goodwill is the only intangible asset on the Company’s balance sheet with an indefinite life. Management will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible impairment.
49
The core deposit intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years. The Company recorded intangible amortization expense of $56 in 2025 and $57 in 2024. The intangible amortization expense is expected to be $57 per year for each of the next four fiscal years and $73 thereafter.

Pursuant to collateral agreements with FHLB, advances are secured by all the stock invested in the FHLB and certain qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The advances were collateralized by $163,200 and $182,257 of first mortgage and multi-family loans under a blanket lien arrangement at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Based on this collateral, the Bank was eligible to borrow up to a total of $86,330 in additional advances at June 30, 2025.
NOTE 9—EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Bank maintains a 401(k) savings and retirement plan that permits eligible employees to make before- or after-tax contributions to the plan, subject to the dollar limits from Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Bank matches 100% of the employee’s voluntary contributions to the plan based on the amount of each participant’s contributions up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation. All regular full-time and part-time employees who complete 90 days of service and are at least 18 years of age are eligible to participate. Amounts charged to operations were $432 and $417 for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The Bank maintains a nonqualified Salary Continuation Plan (SCP) to reward and encourage certain Bank executives to remain employees of the Bank. The SCP is considered an unfunded plan for tax and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) purposes and all obligations arising under the SCP are payable from the general assets of the Company. The estimated present value of future benefits to be paid to certain current and former executives totaled $4,336 as of June 30, 2025 and $3,997 as of June 30, 2024 and is included in other liabilities. For purposes of calculating the present value of future benefits, a discount rate of 5.50% was used to project the liability through June 30, 2025 and 6.0% was used at June 30, 2024. For the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, $479 and $452, respectively, have been charged to expense in connection with the SCP. Distributions to participants were $140 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and $142 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
The Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2010 Plan) is a nonqualified share-based compensation plan. The 2010 Plan was established to promote alignment between key employees’ performance and the Company’s shareholder interests by motivating performance through the award of stock-based compensation. The purpose of the 2010 Plan was to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees and compensate outside directors for their service to the Company. The 2010 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has sole authority to select the employees, establish the awards to be issued, and approve the terms and conditions of each award contract.
51
Under the 2010 Plan, the Company could grant, among other things, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or any combination thereof to any employee and outside director. Each award was evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the number of shares awarded, the vesting period, the performance requirements, and such other provisions as the Compensation Committee determines. Upon a change-in-control of the Company, as defined in the 2010 Plan, all outstanding awards immediately vest.
The Company has granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors. Restricted stock units and awards are issued at no cost to the recipient and can be settled in shares or cash at the end of the vesting period depending on the type of award. Restricted stock awards are made at the end of the measurement period once certain specified performance targets as established by the Compensation Committee are achieved with some awards fully vesting on the date of grant and others vesting 25% on the grant date, with the remaining vesting 25% per year over a three-year period. Restricted stock awards provide the holder with dividends during the vesting period. Cash dividends are reinvested into shares of stock and are subject to the same restrictions and vesting as the initial award. Restricted stock units begin to vest at the end of the measurement period once certain specified performance targets as established by the Compensation Committee are achieved. Some units, primarily the awards made to directors and senior management, are 100% vested at the end of the measurement period. For other unit awards, primarily the awards made to executive management, 25% vest at the end of the performance period, with the remaining vesting 25% per year over a three-year period. The fair value of the restricted stock units and awards, which is used to measure compensation expense, is the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. All dividends are forfeitable in the event the shares do not vest.

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as an income-based tax and the Bank is subject to a capital-based financial institutions tax in the State of Ohio. At June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase within the next twelve months. There were no interest or penalties recorded for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and there were no amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2025 and 2024. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2021.
On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the legislation formally titled “An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H. Con. Res. 14” and commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill (the Act). The Company is currently evaluating the income tax implications of the Act; however, the Company does not expect the Act to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

NOTE 12—REGULATORY MATTERS
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective-action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors and the regulators can lower classifications in certain cases. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements.
The prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and plans for capital restoration are required.
As of fiscal year-end 2025 and 2024, the Company met the definition of a Small Bank Holding Company and, therefore, was exempt from maintaining consolidated regulatory capital ratios. Instead, regulatory capital ratios only apply at the subsidiary bank level. The Basel III Capital Rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of June 30, 2025, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject.
The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 for the Bank:

As of the latest regulatory examination, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized. There are no conditions or events since that examination that management believes may have changed the Bank’s category.
The Company’s principal source of funds for dividend payment is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. As of June 30, 2025 the Bank could, without prior approval, declare a dividend of approximately $17,085.
NOTE 13—COMMITMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
The Bank is a party to commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. Commitments are agreements to lend to customers providing that there are no violations of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk more than the amount recognized in the statements of financial position. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
The Bank evaluates each customer’s credit on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. The amount of commitments to extend credit and the exposure to credit loss for non-performance by the customer (before considering collateral) was $212,550 and $144,616 as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, $144,581 of the commitments carried variable rates and $67,969 carried fixed rates with interest rates ranging from 3.05% to 10.25% with maturity dates from July 2025 to August 2060. As of June 30, 2024, $130,955 of the commitments carried variable rates and $13,661 carried fixed rates with interest rates ranging from 3.05% to 10.50% with maturity dates from July 2024 to January 2056. Financial standby letters of credit were $2,010 and $1,180 as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In addition, commitments to extend credit of $12,609 and $11,298 as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, were available to checking account customers related to the overdraft protection program. Since some loan commitments expire without being used, the amount does not necessarily represent future cash commitments.
NOTE 14—FAIR VALUE
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:
Securities available-for-sale and equity securities: When available, the fair values of available-for-sale and equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs). For securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).
55
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value:

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include the following:
Collateral Dependent Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent loans with specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. Collateral dependent individually evaluated loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or are charged down to their fair value. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. There were no collateral dependent individually evaluated loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2025 or June 30, 2024.
Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets Owned: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to their initial recognition, these assets are remeasured at fair value, which is the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell, through a write-down included in other noninterest expenses. Real estate owned properties and other repossessed assets, which are primarily vehicles, are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. There were no such fair value measurement adjustments recorded during June 30, 2025 or June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024 there were no other real estate owned and other repossessed assets.

The assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying value of cash and deposits in other financial institutions were considered to approximate fair value resulting in a Level 1 classification.
Accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings: The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings were considered to approximate fair value due to their short-term duration resulting in a Level 2 classification.
Loans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.
Loans: Fair value for loans was estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks as well as general portfolio credit risk.
Securities held-to-maturity: The held-to-maturity securities are general obligation and revenue bonds issued by local municipalities. The fair value of these securities are calculated using a spread to the applicable municipal fair market curve resulting in a Level 3 classification.
Time deposits: Fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit was estimated using the rates offered at June 30, 2025 and 2024 for deposits of similar remaining maturities, resulting in Level 2 classification. Estimated fair value does not include the benefit that results from low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market.
Federal Home Loan Bank advances: Fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances was estimated using current rates at June 30, 2025 and 2024 for similar financing resulting in a Level 2 classification.
Federal bank and other restricted stocks, at cost: Federal bank and other restricted stocks include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock that are accounted for at cost due to restrictions placed on their transferability, and, therefore, are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements.
57
Off-balance sheet commitments: The Company’s lending commitments have variable interest rates and “escape” clauses if the customer’s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the above table.
NOTE 15—AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT PARTNERSHIP
In April 2023, the Company invested in a limited partnership that will in turn invest in qualified affordable housing projects that will generate tax benefits for the limited partner investors, including federal low-income housing tax credits pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. This partnership investment is an unconsolidated Variable Interest Entity (VIE) for which the Company holds an interest in but is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The purpose of this investment is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnership include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity.
The Company uses the proportional amortization method to account for its investment. The investment is included in other assets and the unfunded commitment is included in other liabilities. As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Company by the creditors of the limited partnership; however, the tax credits are generally subject to recapture should the partnership fail to comply with the applicable government regulations.
The following table summarizes the balances of the affordable housing tax credit investment and related unfunded commitment at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024.

NOTE 19 – REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company accounts for revenues from contracts with customers under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Interest income, net securities gains (losses), gains from the sale of mortgage loans and bank-owned life insurance are not included within the scope of ASC 606. For the revenue streams in the scope of ASC 606, service charges on deposits and electronic banking fees, there are no significant judgments related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition. All the Company's revenue from contracts with customers is recognized within noninterest income.
Service charges on deposit accounts: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as stop payment charges, statement rendering and other fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer's request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer's account balance.
Interchange income: The Company earns interchange income from cardholder transactions conducted through the various payment networks. Interchange income from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The gross amount of these fees are processed through noninterest income.
Other income: Other noninterest income consists of other recurring revenue streams such as check order fees, wire transfer fees, and other miscellaneous revenue streams. Check order income mainly represents fees charged to customers for checks. Wire transfer fees represent revenue from processing wire transfers.
The following table presents the Company's sources of noninterest income for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.
