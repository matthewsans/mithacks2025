History
and Organization
PCS
Edventures!, Inc., an Idaho corporation (“PCS,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,”
and words of similar import), was originated under the laws of the State of Idaho on August 3, 1994, as “PCS Education Systems,
Inc.” On March 27, 2000, we changed our name from “PCS Education Systems, Inc.” to “PCS Edventures!.com, Inc.”;
and on August 31, 2015, we changed our name from “PCS Edventures!.com, Inc.” to “PCS Edventures!, Inc.” PCS Edventures!,
Inc. is our current company name.
On
February 18, 2016, we announced the completion of an asset purchase of Thrust-UAV, a privately-held company focused on drone technology.
On
March 27, 2017, the Company filed a Form 15-12g with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) whereby, under
Rule 12g-4(a)(1) and Rule 12h-3 (b)(1)(i), it terminated its duty to file reports with the Commission.
Effective
December 31, 2017, the Company’s Executive Vice President, Director, and highest-ranking operations officer, resigned to pursue
other interests. Given his tenure at the Company of over 20 years and his position at the time of his departure, this effectively caused
a change in executive leadership at the Company. On January 1, 2018, Michael J. Bledsoe, then Vice President and Treasurer, and a Director,
was appointed to assume responsibility for the operational oversight of the Company. On April 23, 2018, he was promoted to President,
a position he currently holds. Todd R. Hackett was Chairman of the Board and CEO at the time of this transition and remains in those
positions with the Company.
The
Company’s Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company to register its common
stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and return to its
former status as a “fully-reporting” entity with the Commission given the Company’s improved financial condition and
management’s desire to improve the Company’s reporting quality to shareholders. Accordingly, the Company filed a Form 10
Registration Statement with the Commission on October 3, 2023, which became effective December 4, 2023 (the “Form 10 Registration
Statement”).
On
January 22, 2025, the Board of Directors appointed Sean P. Iddings to the Board, bringing the Board members to three (3) Directors.

Overview
The
Company specializes in creating experiential, hands-on, transitional kindergarten through 12th grade (TK-12) STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math) education products and curriculum. “STEM” is often abbreviated as STEAM – Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math – to include the arts. We use the terms STEM and STEAM interchangeably throughout this
Annual Report and make no significant distinction between the two terms. Through our acquisition of Thrust-UAV, we developed educational
drones and drone curriculum. Our customers include schools and school districts from the collegiate to transitional kindergarten level,
and providers of out-of-school programming, which include after-school programs, military education programs, home-schooling programs,
summer programs, and corporate outreach programs. We sell predominately in the United States and sell into nearly every state in the
nation. We have a few international customers, but revenue from customers outside of the United States is not material, and we do not
focus our sales efforts on international markets at this time.
Our
products facilitate STEM education by providing engaging activities that demonstrate STEM concepts and inspire further STEM studies,
with the goal of ultimately leading students to pursue STEM career pathways. Due to our exceptionally detailed curriculum, our products
are easy to teach and do not require a teaching degree or experience to administer.
PCS’
educational products are developed from both in-house efforts and contracted services. They are marketed through reseller channels, direct
sales efforts, partner networks, and web-based channels.
Products
PCS
has developed and sells a variety of STEM education products into the TK-12 market, which can be categorized as follows:
1.
Enrichment
Programs
These
camps are for the informal learning market and are designed to be highly engaging for students while easily administered by the instructor.
The Company offers approximately 36 different enrichment programs and typically develops at least two (2) new programs each year.
Some of the more popular programs include Podcasting; Ready, Set, Drone!;Drone Designers; Rockin Robots; Claymation; Cubelets
Bot Builder; Influencer Camp; The Science of Super Powers; Flight and Aerodynamics; and Build a Better World.

6.
Professional
Development Training
The
Company offers professional development trainings, for a fee, to educators who are implementing the Company’s products in their
classroom.
The
Company intends to continue developing STEM education products that address demand from large markets.
Distribution
Methods of Products
The
Company sells its products directly to customers and through resellers. The Company kits all of its products at its Meridian, Idaho facility
and ships the products directly to customers. Resellers do not typically inventory the Company’s products and the Company “drop
ships” its products directly to the resellers’ customers. Trainings and Professional Development sessions are conducted either
at the Company’s facilities or at the customer’s location, depending on the desires of the customer. Customers can buy from
the Company’s website, from a reseller’s website, or by presenting the Company with a valid purchase order.
Competition
The
STEM education market is not well defined and is very fragmented. Our products experience competition from multiple angles. Most schoolteachers
with exposure to STEM can create their own lesson plans, using their own materials, to emulate the educational benefits of using the
Company’s products, at a fraction of the cost. The value proposition of our products is less compelling in a budget-constrained
environment, as cost becomes an overriding factor in many such cases. Additionally, there are several sources of free and inexpensive
curriculum that teachers can use to help them deliver STEM educational concepts similar to those experienced by the users of our products.
In
addition to competition at the local level, many of our products face competition from similar products produced by multinational companies
that have significant advantages over us in terms of financial resources, human resources, brand loyalty, supply-chain costs, and global
reach. While many of these companies primarily target the toy industry, their sheer size and cost advantages allow them to easily breach
the education market with their products. In this regard, the Company competes directly with Lego, Robolink, Fischertechnik, K’Nex
(acquired by Basic Fun), and Vex IQ, among many others.
There
are numerous for-profit companies of various sizes that develop and sell STEM educational products. A good example is Teacher Created
Materials, a company headquartered in Huntington Beach, California. They are very similar to our company and much larger.
We
also compete against non-profit organizations, such as Project Lead The Way, who have a mission to promote and implement STEM education.
The programs they provide can be free, subsidized, government-sponsored, rigorously developed, and/or heavily promoted, creating intense
competition for our products and services.
While
there may be several characteristics that differentiate our Company’s products from those of our competition, all of us are competing
for a finite market. There are several potential solutions to STEM education demand and, oftentimes, companies can achieve a first-mover
advantage by developing a relationship with a customer or distributor, and integrating their suite of products and services into the
supply chain before we can showcase our offerings.
5
We
believe that we have a competitive advantage in curriculum development. We employ STEM teachers who, through experience, understand the
environment that educators operate within and the unique challenges they face, and we develop our curriculum with the educator in mind
for an easy, successful, and consistent implementation. Many of our competitors’ products focus on the product or the student,
with the educator left to figure out the details of implementation.
Manufacturing,
Supplies, and Quality Control
Our
Enrichment Programs contain several types of materials, kitted in a box. There is no manufacturing involved in the creation of our final
product in the Enrichment Program category. Nearly all materials used are non-proprietary and commercially available. The materials are
mostly consumer discretionary (paper, crayons, pencils, tape, yarn, etc.) and sourced from a variety of vendors, some of which are located
outside of the United States. Some of our Enrichment Programs contain proprietary products from other companies, commercially available,
and the Company maintains close relationships with these suppliers. The final creation of the product via kitting and packaging is done
at our warehouse facility in Meridian, Idaho. This includes the printing of the curriculum. All curriculum development oversight is performed
at our corporate facility, also in Meridian, Idaho, but separate from our warehouse facility.
We
have been working closely with our vendors located outside of the United States to determine the impact of any tariff on our transactions.
Most vendors pass a portion of the tariff amount onto their customers, including us. In some cases, we have negotiated to split the tariff
amount with the vendor. Tariffs are a relatively new development, and we are proactively assessing the impact of them on our costs.
Our
Discover series of products contains some proprietary products designed by our Company and manufactured abroad as well as non-proprietary,
commercially available products. Most of our Discover series of products are comprised of other companies’ final products, combined
with our curriculum. Our RubiQ education drone is a proprietary product of the Company and is the main component in Discover Drones.
The RubiQ education drone’s components are manufactured abroad and quality-controlled at our corporate facility. The final creation
of the product via kitting and packaging is done at our warehouse facility in Meridian, Idaho. This includes the printing of the curriculum.
All curriculum development oversight is performed at our corporate facility, also in Meridian, Idaho, but separate from our warehouse
facility.
Our
BrickLAB products contain proprietary plastic building bricks (that are Lego compatible) manufactured for us by a long-time vendor with
manufacturing facilities in South Korea. The final creation of the product via kitting and packaging is done at our warehouse facility
in Meridian, Idaho. This includes the printing of the curriculum; and all curriculum development oversight is also performed at our corporate
facility.
The
STEAMventures BUILD Activity Book was developed at our corporate facility. The final creation of the product via kitting and packaging
is done at our warehouse facility. This includes the printing of the curriculum; and all curriculum development oversight is also performed
at our corporate facility.
Sources
and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers
Raw
material procurement became more challenging in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Backlogs created availability problems
for a few items, shipping congestion from time to time significantly delayed shipment of many items, and prices of nearly all items increased
materially.
Supply
chains recovered as the Covid-19 pandemic receded, but recent tariff activity by the U.S. has complicated supply chain management once
again. We expect continued inflation in the materials we use in our final products.
With
few exceptions, we can generally source materials from multiple vendors, although the pricing from different vendors varies considerably.
Thus, supply problems that we experience generally do not impair our business from functioning. However, supply problems that cause us
to procure from higher-priced sources negatively affect our gross margin as we cannot adjust our prices as quickly as the prices of our
raw materials increase.
6
In
response these challenging environments, we have raised prices on selected items every year to reset our margins back to desirable levels
after price increases of inputs. Additionally, we buy in bulk to achieve better pricing, and have increased general inventory levels.
While we purchase from numerous vendors, below are our most used vendors by dollar volume:
Mida’s
Global
Robolink
Amazon
FPVelite

Dependence
on One or a Few Major Customers
During
Fiscal Year 2025, we had four (4) major customers who each accounted for at least 5% of sales and who, when aggregated, accounted for
27.8% of sales. The details of sales from our major customers are below:

Customer
A is a reseller. The sales from reseller customers represent the aggregation of many purchase orders each of these customers placed with
us throughout the year. Our reseller customers place an order with us when their customer orders our product from them. This cycle recurs
numerous times throughout any given year.
We
work closely and frequently with our larger customers to ensure that they are receiving the value proposition and service from us they
require to continue doing business with us. We would categorize our relationship with these customers as excellent and do not believe
that there is a risk to any of these relationships over the next year. Customer C, being a contract with a specified ending date with
no minimum order requirement in any given year, is not likely to experience the duration with us as our other major customers have, although
the possibility exists that a new contract will be created to replace the current one when it expires.
We
believe that the risk of losing any one (1) of these customers is small, and we are actively, and successfully, soliciting larger customers
to diversify our current customer concentration. While we believe the risk of losing any one (1) of these major customers over the next
year is small, the loss of any two (2) of these customers, without similar replacement, would pose a significant risk to the financial
health of the Company.
Seasonality
of Business
Our
business is subjected to strong seasonal patterns during any given year, with our busiest period coinciding with summer learning and
the planning leading up to providing summer programs (January through July). The period between Thanksgiving and the New Year is our
slowest time, coinciding with the holiday season, as most schools observe the holidays with significant time off during this period.
Patents,
Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, including Duration
We
do not have any designs or equipment which are patented, registered trademarked, or licensed.
Research
and Development Costs During the Last Two Fiscal Years
We
currently expense our costs under a general operating expense category instead of capitalizing any research and development expenses.
Employees
As
of March 31, 2025, we had 25 full-time employees.

Impact
of the Covid-19 Pandemic
The
pandemic affected our end markets considerably for a period of time when lockdown orders were enacted at schools and after-school programs.
We sell to educational program providers, and our products are designed to be used in-person with group collaboration encouraged. School
closures and a movement to remote learning during much of calendar year 2020 significantly and negatively impacted our revenue. Our revenue
for fiscal year 2021 (ending March 31, 2021) declined 57.7% from our revenue for fiscal year 2020. For fiscal year 2022, the impact from
the pandemic was negligible, as most TK-12 learning institutions and after-school programs resumed in-person learning and services. We
reported record revenue in fiscal year 2023 and again in fiscal year 2024, indicating that the any lingering effects of the pandemic
were insignificant.
During
the pandemic when our markets were significantly impaired by mandated lockdowns, we developed a STEM activity book, titled STEAMventures,
which could be used in a distance-learning environment. We also modified two (2) of our enrichment programs to be used at the individual
level instead of at the group level, to accommodate areas where in-person learning was not possible. Through these developments, we believe
that we have a better suite of offerings for distance-learning environments, should that environment arise again.
Impact
of the Policies of the New Administration
In
January, we had a change in the Presidency of the United States and, with it, a sharp turn from past education policy. The current administration
wants to end the Department of Education, which administers billions of dollars of grants nationwide. Some of these grants will likely
cease, and some will likely be administered by a different agency or allocated to the states to administer. While nothing has been finalized
yet, the uncertainty of what might happen has created confusion and anxiety in our market, which has frozen decision makers.
Schools
that promote DEI policies have had funding terminated or have received threats of doing so should these policies continue to be promoted.
Some of these schools have pursued legal action against the administration. This has also added to the confusion and anxiety in our market.
Additionally,
as early as April of 2024, the prior administration granted extensions to the deadline of using ESSER funds, from September 30, 2024,
to March of 2026. The new administration rescinded these extensions, complicating budgets for many schools that were counting on this
funding extension. This has further added to the confusion and anxiety in our market.
Management
believes that as these uncertainties are removed, these disruptions to our market will recede.
Additionally,
the new administration has used tariffs as a policy tool to address trade imbalances. While nothing has been finalized yet, management
believes that costs of raw materials procured from overseas suppliers will likely increase due to some sort of permanent tariff policy.
While the ultimate magnitude of these cost increases is yet unknown, the likelihood of their continued existence is high, which translates
into increased raw materials costs. The Company has been working with its vendors, one at a time, to manage through these uncertain times
regarding tariff rates. The Company reprices its products once per year, and will likely pass the majority of any tariff-related cost
increases on to the customer.
Growth
Plan
Our
primary focus is to continue penetrating the U.S. market with our current product line as we feel the market is large relative to our
current market share and receptive to our value proposition of high-quality, easily implemented, hands-on STEM programs. We are actively
pursuing larger customers who can implement our programs at multiple sites, recognizing that some unique product development may be required
for these sales. We intend to develop new products and to enhance our current product line based on market feedback we receive, both
solicited and unsolicited, and based on developments within our market. We intend to further develop and enhance our educational drone
product line, and we are prepared to compete intensely in this product category, as we believe that 1), our curriculum offers us a competitive
advantage in this space, and 2), the educational drone market is nascent and is expected to continue to grow significantly.
8
In
response to new policies on education by the new administration, we are embarking on two (2) new initiatives that complement our current
strategies. The first initiative is to align our products more closely with state and standards and quality guidelines, especially where
such a conversion is easy. In the past, we have aligned our products closer to national standards and quality guidelines (than state
standards) for the following three reasons:
1.
Many of the programs we serve receive their funding from federal grants;
2.
When state standards are relevant, they are loosely applied to out-of-school-time programs; and
3.
There is considerable overlap between federal standards and many of the state’s standards.
Given
the new administration’s vocal desire to return education administration to the states, we believe that if it is successful in
that endeavor, then paying more attention to state-level priorities will enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of our products.
The
second initiative is to provide evidence that our products accomplish certain desired educational outcomes. Many of the opportunities
that we see that are sponsored by a state entity require evidence-based solutions. We anticipate that the evidence-based requirement
will grow over time, so we are commissioning studies to be done on a handful of our products to produce evidence of various positive
outcomes. We are early in this process and do not expect to have the final results until early in calendar year 2026.
Regulation
and Environmental Compliance
Presently,
none of our products are in highly regulated industries.
Need
for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
No
products presently being manufactured or sold by us are subject to prior governmental approvals. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the educational
drone market is relatively new and undergoing significant regulatory evolution. We stay current on these regulatory developments and
help our customers understand and comply with new regulations.
Effect
of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
Our
Form 10 Registration Statement became effective 60 days after filing with the Commission (December 4, 2023, by reason of the 60th
day being a Saturday), at which point our securities became registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Issuers with securities
registered under Section 12(g) are subject to numerous regulatory requirements under the Exchange Act. For example, we are subject to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct
of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of
senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes
clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines
for audit committee members appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; prohibits certain
insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.
Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with
the rules and regulations of the Commission regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders
of our Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require that we provide our stockholders
with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the
Commission at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.
With
the effectiveness of our Form 10 Registration Statement, we also became required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q with the Commission on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in
corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; changes
in executive officers and directors; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
9
The
Company currently does not hold any intellectual property rights. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade and business secrets,
we cannot assure that our employees, consultants, contractors, or advisors will not, unintentionally or willfully, disclose our trade
secrets to competitors or other third parties. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes
less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, the Company’s competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods,
and know-how. If we are unable to defend our trade secrets from others use, or if our competitors develop equivalent knowledge, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs,
and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting
in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenue. Existing patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of
the United States. Therefore, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party use. Enforcing a
claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using the Company’s trade secrets could be expensive and time-consuming, and
the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our trade secrets or to determine
the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources
and could materially adversely affect our future operating results.

1C. Cybersecurity
Processes
for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are conducted in-house, with the help of analytics
and notifications that are built-in to our third-party tools. These processes include:
a.
Providing
employees with tools and training to minimize and report cybersecurity risks;
b.
Monitoring
databases and tools for unusual activity or suspicious login attempts;
c.
Tracking,
managing, and safely disposing of physical hardware; and
d.
Responding
to any identified threats and reporting these situations to management.
Cybersecurity
threats could potentially result in slowed or halted business operations, such as shipping, closing sales, marketing engagement, and
other communications. This would negatively impact the Company’s financial condition until the issue is resolved. Such threats
could impact customers of certain programs that rely on digital resources, but a majority of our products would not be materially affected.
Other threats may include the compromise of customer personally-identifiable information. We continually monitor for threats to avoid
risks to Company or individuals’ data, interruptions to business operations, or financial losses.
No
cybersecurity incidents were identified this year. One threat was identified: insecurely stored credentials. This was responded to by
implementing an encrypted password manager Company-wide. We will continue to monitor for threats to avoid risks to Company or individuals’
data, interruptions to business operations, or financial losses. Information about risks or any identified cybersecurity threats are
reported by our Director of Technology to our President.
Identified
cybersecurity risks are reported to IT, where they are assessed and responded to. Any actions taken or cybersecurity incidents identified
are reported to the Director of Technology. Qualifications for these individuals include prior experience, education, and/or training
in cybersecurity.

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements,
below, of this Annual Report.
Overview
of Current and Planned Operations
PCS
Edventures!, Inc. sells STEM/STEAM products to educational and recreational entities serving youth. Because the majority of our customers
work in out-of-school-time settings, we have not attempted to align our products to fit in the classroom setting, until recently. Classroom
curriculum must promote academic achievement through rigorous alignment with specific state standards to be considered for use. Each
state has its own unique set of standards, making classroom curriculum development a state by-state endeavor.
On
the other hand, out of school programs focus more broadly on the goals of engagement, career exploration and development of 21st
century skills. This difference makes it easier to penetrate out-of-school programs, as more freedoms exist for curriculum development.
We focus our efforts on these out-of-school programs, which include summer school, summer camps, YMCA programs, Boys and Girls club programs,
and various other programs offered outside of the classroom, at all times of the year, that are too numerous to list. Oftentimes, these
programs are sponsored, administered, and/or supported by local school districts, and we employ considerable efforts to build relationships
with these types of school districts to provide desired programing for their out-of-school programs. The majority of the time, the out-of-school
programs offered are funded with grants; however, some programs are run on a for-profit basis. The Company sells to all of these types
of entities.
However,
given the new administration’s stated goals of removing federal influence and administration from education, and returning those
functions to the states, we are now considering which of our products would be adaptable to the educational standards of certain larger
states. We intend to continue to weigh state-level priorities much more heavily in the development of future products as well. We view
a transition from federal dominance to state dominance of the application of educational standards to curriculum as likely, albeit over
a long time frame, and we are adapting our product development to this change in our market.
Market
feedback also indicates that products that have evidence of their effectiveness are increasingly being demanded, especially in state-funded
programs and larger programs. While we maintain a library of the evidence we have accumulated about the outcomes one can expect when
using our products, and while this library of evidence has helped us win larger orders, we believe that expanding this library and upgrading
the tiers of evidence we have will produce meaningful benefits for future sales.
12
We
have engaged various firms to help us generate more compelling evidence of our products’ effectiveness. We are early in this process,
but we intend to substantially build out our library of evidence of our products’ effectiveness. The course we take to accomplish
this endeavor will depend on our experiences with these early initiatives.
We
offer professional development training for instructors using our products, and typically charge a fee for this service, with the fee
primarily covering our expenses. Management does not view this service as a profit center, but rather as a customer service component
of our product that adds to its uniqueness and value in the marketplace, and as a market development endeavor to build out the Company’s
addressable market.
The
nature of our target market produces considerable seasonality for the Company’s revenue. The quarters ending June 30 and September
30 tend to be the peak of this seasonality (with the quarter ending March 31 being close to these quarters), while the quarter ending
December 31 tends to be the low point of our seasonality. The Table below reflects this seasonality.

and marketing activities remain fairly constant throughout the year.

Revenue
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, our revenue was $7,421,228 compared to $9,094,466 for the year ended March 31, 2024. There were five (5)
factors that negatively impacted our revenue in fiscal year 2025 versus that in fiscal year 2024.
1.
We
did not win an Iowa STEM Scale-Up contract in fiscal year 2025 and reported no revenue from that customer. In fiscal year 2024, our
revenue from our Iowa STEM Scale-Up contract was $823,143. In fiscal year 2023, our revenue from this customer was $467,457. We won
a contract for fiscal year 2026 and expect associated revenue for this contract to be closer to our fiscal year 2023 experience.
2.
Our
Catapult order was significantly less in fiscal year 2025 versus that of fiscal year 2024. Catapult administers summer programming
in Missouri due to the state’s public funding of such programs. They experience annual fluctuations in their customer base,
and they inventory our products over the course of the year. Thus, seasons when their customer base is down and when their inventory
of our products is high produce smaller orders than seasons when their customer base is up and they have a low inventory of our products.
We believe that their order placed with us in fiscal year 2025, in the aggregate amount of $587,100, was under the former conditions,
and that their order placed with us in fiscal year 2024, in the amount of $1,286,695, was under the latter conditions.
3.
Our
Air Force JROTC (“AFJROTC”) contract produces less revenue as the contract ages. The AFJROTC has approximately 884 sites, and we have
sold into approximately 642 of them thus far.
4.
The
expiration of ESSER funds on September 30, 2024, eliminated a key funding stream for our products during the second half of our fiscal
year.
5.
The
change in Presidential administration created significant changes in the education market regarding funding streams, administration
of grants, and general federal influence over education. These changes were and still are disruptive to educational decision making
and, thus, disruptive to our market.
The
Company has been soliciting larger customers for over three (3) years and has seen some success. The AFJROTC is the Company’s largest
success by a wide margin, producing revenue of $453,314 in the year ended March 31, 2025, $1,269,036 in the year ended March 31, 2024,
and $2,655,336 in the year ended March 31, 2023.
13
We
have experienced other successes in our campaign to find larger customers. The table below shows customer transactions by size for the
periods indicated.

We
believe that we can continue to experience success in soliciting larger customers, but we can offer no assurances that success will be
certain, nor can we offer any numerical framework in describing the success that may occur. Risk factors include anything that would
negatively affect educational funding in the United States; finding and retaining employees that meet our high standards; and anything
that would negatively affect our supply chain of critical components.
Cost
of Sales
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, our cost of sales was $2,983,940, or 40.2% of revenue. For the year ended March 31, 2024, our cost of
sales was $3,359,801, or 36.9% of revenue.
We
strive to have a cost of sales that is less than 40% of revenue. We price our products once per year, at the beginning of the calendar
year, and maintain that pricing level throughout the year. During inflationary environments, when the price level of the Company’s
raw materials is increasing, the Company must absorb that negative impact to gross margins until we can reprice our products at the beginning
of the next calendar year. This repricing analysis considers the current pricing level of materials, as well as the likely increase in
those levels in the year ahead. We attempt to incorporate shipping costs into the cost of raw materials, but oftentimes during the course
of the year, we are compelled to ship in a more expedient manner, which is more expensive than our baseline assumptions.
Factors
affecting cost of sales include:
Helps
sub 40% cost of sales
Impedes
sub 40% cost of sales
Higher
revenue
Higher
inflation

Operating
Expenses
Operating
expenses are divided into two categories – salary + wages, and general + administrative. Salary and wages tend to increase over
time as the Company has been increasing its number of employees, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Also, we desire to
retain employees over the long term, which requires periodic increases in compensation as their value to the Company increases.
The
Company also has a discretionary quarterly bonus program based on qualified revenue. Qualified revenue is defined as revenue where there
are no reseller fees or other price adjustments associated with that revenue. Thus, all reseller sales are disqualified from the discretionary
quarterly bonus calculation, as are other miscellaneous transactions where the Company did not receive a full margin. During quarters
with higher revenue, salaries and wages will increase all other things equal.
Salary
and wages were $1,914,941 for the year ended March 31, 2025, compared to $1,778,946 for the year ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31,
2025, we had 25 full-time employees. As of March 31, 2024, we had 22 full-time employees.
14
General
and administrative expenses include all operating expenses outside of salaries and wages. These include the following categories:
1.
Advertising
and marketing expenses;
2.
Trade
show and travel expenses;
3.
Product
development expenses;
4.
Finance
charges;
5.
Contract
labor expenses;
6.
Lease

7.

8.
Workers’

9.
Office
supplies and repairs;
10.
Professional
expenses;
11.
Licenses;
12.
State
sales tax expenses; and
13.
Office
and warehouse infrastructure expenses.
Most
of these expenses are not strongly correlated with changes in revenue, but they tend to increase over time. General and administrative
expenses were $1,439,014 for the year ended March 31, 2025. For the year ended March 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses were
$1,148,652. In late October and early November of 2024, we ended our lease on our 10,000 square foot combined warehouse and office facility,
and entered into two (2) new leases - a 20,880 square foot warehouse and R&D facility, and a 5,016 square foot corporate office facility.
This expansion was the primary driver in the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2025 versus fiscal year 2024,
although general inflation also played a significant role.
Total
Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2025, were $3,353,955, compared to $2,927,598 for the year ended March 31, 2024.
Other
Income/Expenses
Other
income and expenses are those outside of the Company’s ordinary course of business. During the Covid pandemic, the Employee Retention
Tax Credit was offered to companies to keep employees on the payroll during the lockdowns. The Company qualified for those benefits,
which are disclosed under other income and expenses.
Interest
income and interest expense are also disclosed under other income and expenses. The Company had considerable interest expense prior to
paying off all of its promissory note debt as of March 31, 2023. Since that time and as the Company has accumulated cash, it has invested
surplus cash in a Vanguard money market fund that invests exclusively in repurchase agreements and short-term U.S. government securities.
The ticker symbol of this fund is “VMFXX.”
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, other income and expenses were $127,930, with net interest income comprising the entire amount. For the
year ended March 31, 2024, other income and expenses were $104,328, with interest income totaling $48,904.
Net
Income Before Tax
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, net income before tax was $1,211,263 versus $2,911,395 for the year ended March 31, 2024. The Company
experienced a lower sales level in fiscal year 2025 versus that of fiscal year 2024, which largely accounts for the difference in net
income before tax for these two periods. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2025 were also higher than those for fiscal year 2024.
Taxes
The
Company has significant net operating losses which arose due to past losses. At March 31, 2025, the Company had net operating losses
of approximately $8.0 million that may be offset against future taxable income. The federal net operating losses and tax credits expire
in years beginning in 2029. The state net operating losses and tax credits expire in years beginning in 2026.
Prior
to fiscal year 2023, the Company offset its potential tax benefit from the operating loss carry-forwards with a valuation allowance in
the same amount. As it became clear that the Company will more likely than not use its tax loss carry-forward amounts, the valuation
allowance was partially removed for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, such that the tax benefit recognized by us in fiscal year
2023 was $1,011,466. The valuation allowance was fully removed as of March 31, 2024, resulting in a tax benefit of $1,529,793 for fiscal
year 2024. Once the valuation allowance was fully removed, a provision for income taxes was disclosed. For the fiscal year ending March
31, 2025, the Company’s provision for income taxes was ($264,865).
15
Net
Income
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, net income was $946,865 versus $4,441,188 for the year ended March 31, 2024. Removing the tax loss carry-forward
valuation allowance added $1,529,793 to net income for the year ended March 31, 2024.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Cash
Flow from Operations
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, cash provided by operations was $2,520,966 compared to cash provided by operations of $975,680 for the
year ended March 31, 2024. A decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, and a smaller increase in inventory as of March 31,
2025, compared to March 31, 2024, were the largest factors behind the increase of cash flow from operations in fiscal year 2025 over
that in fiscal year 2024.
As
of March 31, 2025, total current assets were $5,918,984 and total current liabilities were $326,439, resulting in working capital of
$5,592,545. As of March 31, 2024, total current assets were $5,425,141 and total current liabilities were $416,154, resulting in working
capital of $5,008,987.
The
Company had a current ratio as of March 31, 2025, of 18.13 compared to a current ratio of 13.04 as of March 31, 2024.
As
of March 31, 2025, we had $3,223,147 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $1,329,708 in cash as of March 31, 2024. The improvements
in working capital, current ratio, and cash on hand are largely due to the realization of $1,675,859 of accounts receivable during fiscal
year 2025 that were on the books at the end of fiscal year 2024.
Cash
Flow from Investing Activities
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, cash used by investing activities was $79,814 compared to cash used by investing activities of $23,696
for the year ended March 31, 2024. We purchased warehouse and office equipment related to our move from one facility to two during fiscal
year 2025, which accounts for the increase in cash used by investing activities.
Cash
Flow from Financing Activities
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, cash used by financing activities was $547,713. We made the following common stock repurchase transactions
during fiscal year 2025, which accounts for this activity:

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of PCS Edventures!, Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of PCS Edventures!, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2025, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Deferred
Tax Asset
ASC
740 Income Taxes discusses the considerations for valuing deferred tax assets. The Company has significant net operating losses (NOLs)
resulting in the recognition of a significant deferred tax asset. The Company has determined that the asset will be fully realized based
on current earnings trends. The Company uses judgment in order to determine whether an allowance is needed. We considered this a significant
estimate that involved subjective judgments made by management.
How
We Addressed it During Our Audit
We
tested management’s determination and calculations of their tax provision and deferred taxes, to ensure they were recorded in accordance
with ASC 740 Income Taxes.

6.
Professional Development
Training
The
Company offers professional development trainings, for a fee, to educators who are implementing the Company’s products in their
classroom.
The
Company intends to continue developing STEM education products that address demand from large markets.
Accounting
Method
The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a March 31st
fiscal year end.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents, totaling $3,223,147 and $1,329,708 at March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, respectively, consist of operating and
savings accounts. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid financial instruments with original
maturities of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant estimates include reserves related to accounts receivable and inventory,
the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, the valuation of equity instruments, and debt discounts.
Concentration
of Credit Risks and Significant Customers
The
Company extends credit to customers and is therefore subject to credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit
terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible
losses which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. An allowance for credit losses is recorded
to account for potential bad debts. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for credit losses and are based upon an assessment
of selected accounts, historic averages, and as a percentage of remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these
percentages, the Company evaluates historical write-offs, and current trends in customer credit quality, as well as changes in credit
policies. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. The Company has established an allowance for credit losses
of $38,027 as of March 31, 2025, and $34,204 as of March 31, 2024.
The
following Table shows the Company’s concentration of credit risk, sorted by accounts receivable as of March 31, 2025, and 2024.

Concentration
of Credit Risk of Cash Deposits
We
have three (3) operating accounts at two (2) different banks. We have a checking and depository account at one bank and a checking account
at another bank. From time to time, cash balances in these accounts exceed the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit. However, these instances
occur infrequently as we strive to maintain balances below the $250,000 limit in each of these accounts. We also have a Vanguard money
market account where we invest our cash assets that are in excess of our working capital needs. The Vanguard money market account is
not subject to FDIC insurance and invests exclusively in repurchase agreements and short-term U.S. government securities.
Inventory
Finished
goods inventory is composed of items produced in-house, as well as items from outside suppliers. These items include, but are not limited
to, Fischertechnik® manipulatives, Brick manipulatives, drone components, robotics components, furniture units, curriculum, and other
miscellaneous items used in our various labs. Our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value and valued using
the average cost method for each item.
When
indicators of inventory impairment exist, the Company measures the carrying value of the inventory against its market value, and if the
carrying value exceeds the market value, the inventory value is adjusted accordingly. The Company has established a provision for excess
and obsolete inventory reserve of $3,981 as of March 31, 2025, and $3,274 as of March 31, 2024.
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Depreciation
on property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company had fully
depreciated property and equipment prior to March 31, 2018. Beginning in fiscal year 2022 through the current reporting period, the Company
purchased various warehouse and office equipment for $141,832 and recognized $44,619 in depreciation of that equipment for a total property
and equipment of $97,213 as of March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2024, property and equipment was $43,739, which was net of $18,280 in
depreciation recognized.
Software
has been fully depreciated as of March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances arise that indicate the existence of impairment for patents
and other intangibles. There was no impairment recorded during the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024.
Income
Taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
In
November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” (ASU 2015-17), which requires reporting the net amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities
as a single noncurrent item on the classified balance sheet. Before this change, the net amounts of current and noncurrent deferred tax
assets and liabilities were reported separately.
We
account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the asset and
liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts, using
currently enacted tax laws. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established, based on the weight of available evidence, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets, net of deferred
tax liabilities, is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income. We exercise significant judgment in determining
our provisions for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our
ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets.
24
In
accordance with GAAP, the Company has analyzed its filing positions in all jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
for the open tax years in such jurisdictions. The Company currently believes that all significant filing positions are highly certain
and that all of its significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit. Therefore, the Company has
no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions, and no adjustment to such reserves was required by GAAP. No interest or penalties
have been levied against the Company and none are anticipated; therefore no interest or penalty has been included in the provision for
income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions which reduce or limit the availability
and utilization of net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forwards in the event of a more than 50% change in ownership. If such
an ownership change occurs with the Company, the use of these net operating losses could be limited.

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company accounts for revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on April
1, 2018. Revenue amounts presented in our financial statements are recognized net of sales tax, value-added taxes, and other taxes. Amounts
received as prepayment on future products or services are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized as income when the product is
shipped, or service performed.
The
Company had deferred revenue of $20,026 as of March 31 2025, related to contractual commitments with customers where the performance
obligation will be satisfied within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. The revenue associated with these performance obligations
is recognized as the obligation is satisfied. The Company had $14,549 of deferred revenue as of March 31, 2024.
Most
of our contracts with customers contain transaction prices with fixed consideration; however, some contracts may contain variable consideration
in the form of discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, penalties and other similar items. When a contract
includes variable consideration, we evaluate the estimate of variable consideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained;
therefore, we include the variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal
of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.
This can result in recognition of revenue over time as we perform services or at a point in time when the deliverable is transferred
to the customer, depending on an evaluation of the criteria for over time recognition in FASB ASC 606. For certain fixed-fee per transaction
contracts, such as delivering training courses or conducting workshops, revenue is recognized during the period in which services are
delivered in accordance with the pricing outlined in the contracts.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
recognize stock-based compensation expense under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”).
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options at their respective grant date. The use of
option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility and the expected
term of the option. The fair value of restricted stock awards is the fair market value on the date of grant. We recognize these compensation
costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.
During
fiscal years 2025 and 2024, no performance options were issued or exercised.
As
of March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding warrants or options.
25
Business
Segments and Related Information
GAAP
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and requires enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders.
It also establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company currently
operates as one (1) business segment.
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Beginning
in fiscal year 2025 annual reporting, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) that was issued by the FASB. This new standard requires an enhanced disclosure of significant
segment expenses on an annual basis.
Operating
Segments and Related Disclosures
We
manage our Company as one (1) reportable operating segment, STEM Supplies and Curriculum. The segment information aligns with how the
Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews and manages our business. The Company’s CODM is the
Company’s President.
Financial
information and annual operating plans and forecasts are prepared and reviewed by the CODM at a consolidated level. The CODM assesses
performance for the STEM Supplies and Curriculum segment and decides how to better allocate resources based on net income reported on
the Statements of Operations. The Company’s objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimize the financial results.
The accounting policies of our STEM Supplies and Curriculum segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies herein.
For
single reportable segment-level financial information, total assets, and significant non-cash transactions, see our Financial Statements.
Net
Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
The
Company calculates net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260”). Under ASC 260,
basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes vested restricted
stock awards. Diluted net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming exercise
of all dilutive unexercised stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of these instruments was determined using the treasury stock
method. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock awards, the amount
of compensation cost for future service not yet recognized by the Company and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded as income
tax expense when the stock options become deductible for income tax purposes are all assumed to be used to repurchase shares of the Company’s
common stock.
Common
stock outstanding reflected in the Company’s balance sheets includes “restricted” stock awards outstanding. Securities
that may participate in undistributed net income with common stock are considered participating securities. The computation of diluted
earnings per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. The following schedules
presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share:

NOTE
7 – NOTES PAYABLE
The
Company had no notes payable outstanding as of March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024.
NOTE
8 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
The
Company adopted ASC 842 as of November 9, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at December
31, 2019, the date of the initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated, and disclosures required under
ASC 842, will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2020.
The
Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Right of use assets related to operating type leases are
reported in other noncurrent assets and the present value of remaining lease obligations is reported in accrued and other liabilities
and other noncurrent liabilities on the Balance Sheets. The Company does not currently have any financing type leases.
Operating
lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rates applicable to
the economic environment based on the information available at commencement date, in determining the present value of future payments.
The right of use asset for operating leases is measured using the lease liability adjusted for the impact of lease payments made prior
to commencement, lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and any asset impairments. Lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for minimum lease payments
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The
Company re-measures and reallocates the consideration in a lease when there is a modification of the lease that is not accounted for
as a separate contract. The lease liability is re-measured when there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of
whether the Company will exercise a lease option. The Company assesses right of use assets for impairment in accordance with its long-lived
asset impairment policy.
The
Company accounts for lease agreements with contractually required lease and non-lease components on a combined basis. Lease payments
made for cancellable leases, variable amounts that are not based on an observable index and lease agreements with an original duration
of less than twelve months are recorded directly to lease expense.
a.
Warehouse
The
Company leases a 20,880 square foot warehouse facility located at 1135 N. Hickory Ave, Suite 130, Meridian, ID 83642, under a non-cancelable
lease agreement, which commenced on October 1, 2024, and expires November 30, 2029. The first two (2) payments were deferred. This lease

the previous amount in the month of December each year.
28
b.

11 – INCOME TAXES
Prior
to fiscal year 2023, the Company offset its potential tax benefit from the operating loss carry-forwards with a valuation allowance in
the same amount. As it became clear that the Company will more likely than not use its tax loss carry-forward amounts, the valuation
allowance was partially removed for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, such that the tax benefit recognized by us in fiscal year
2023 was $1,011,466. The valuation allowance was fully removed as of March 31, 2024, resulting in a tax benefit of $1,529,793 for fiscal
year 2024. Once the valuation allowance was fully removed, a provision for income taxes was disclosed. For the fiscal year ending March
31, 2025, the Company’s provision for income taxes was ($264,398).
FASB
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than
not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of March 31, 2025. The Company
is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its
position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
The
Company may be subject to potential examination by federal, state, and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential
examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and compliance
with federal, state, and city tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
will materially change over the next 12 months.
Although
we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject
to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. We periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. Changes in income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels, among other things, could
materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among
financial reporting periods.
The
Company files income tax returns in the United States, the State of Idaho and the State of California. The statute of limitations on
a Federal tax return is the due date of the tax return plus three (3) years. In the case of NOLs, the year in which the NOL was generated
remains open up to the amount of the NOL until the statute of limitations expires on the year it was used. All required tax returns of
the Company due since inception have been filed. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits to report in the current period.

intends to continue to repurchase its common stock in the open market from time to time. When the Company accumulates a significant amount
of its common shares, it intends to obtain those shares in certificate form and have its transfer agent cancel the shares.
On
May 23, 2025, the Company concluded a private stock repurchase from a shareholder, buying 284,959 shares at $0.14 per share, for total
consideration of $39,894.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure
that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, in this case, our President, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly
present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
Management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our President who acts as our Principal Financial Officer have evaluated the
effectiveness, as of March 31, 2025, of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025, due to the
Company engaging the professional CPA firm of B.A. Harris, CPAs, to assist the Company in preparing our preliminary condensed financial
statements and schedules for our auditor’s review.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
At
the end of fiscal year 2024, management recognized that it needed assistance in the preparation of financial statements. The Company
engaged B.A. Harris, CPAs, to assist in the preparation of financial statements during fiscal year 2025. With the exception of engaging
B.A. Harris, CPAs, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
Under
Rule 13d-3 of the Commission, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct
the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares
may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose
of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares
(for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage
ownership of any person, the number of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person
(and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown
in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of
common stock actually outstanding.
The
following table sets forth, as of March 31, 2025, the names, addresses and number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by all
persons known to the management of PCS to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, and the names
and number of shares beneficially owned by all directors of PCS and all executive officers and directors of PCS as a group (except as
indicated, each beneficial owner listed exercises sole voting power and sole dispositive power over the shares beneficially owned).
36
For
purposes of this table, information as to the beneficial ownership of shares of common stock is determined in accordance with the rules
of the Commission and includes general voting power and/or investment power with respect to securities. Except as otherwise indicated,
all shares of our common stock are beneficially owned, and sole investment and voting power is held, by the person named. For purposes
of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of any shares of common stock which
such person has the right to acquire within 60 days after the date hereof. The inclusion herein of such shares listed beneficially owned
does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership.
All
percentages are calculated based upon a total number of 121,924,804 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2025.

Transactions
with Promoters and Control Persons
There
were no material transactions, or series of similar transactions, during our Company’s last five fiscal years, or any currently
proposed transactions, or series of similar transactions, to which we were or are to be a party and in which any promoter or founder
of ours or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had an interest. We have not had any promoters or parents
during the past five (5) fiscal years.

Director
Independence.
Our
Board of Directors is currently composed of three (3) members, Todd R. Hackett, Michael J. Bledsoe, and Sean P. Iddings. Todd R. Hackett
and Michael J. Bledsoe do not qualify as independent directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global
Market (the Company has no plans to list on the NASDAQ Global Market).
Sean
P. Iddings qualifies as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The
NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least
three (3) years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business
dealings with us.
In
addition, our Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination, as to our directors, that no relationships exist which, in
the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations,
our Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our directors and us with regard to our directors’
business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.
