(the Company) is a global industrial technology leader, that helps customers across the General Engineering, Transportation, Earthworks, Energy and Aerospace & Defense end markets build their products with precision and efficiency. The Company was founded based on a tungsten carbide technology breakthrough in 1938 and was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1943 as a manufacturer of tungsten carbide metal cutting tooling. In 1967, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the stock ticker KMT.The Company's core expertise includes the development and application of tungsten carbides, ceramics, super-hard materials and solutions used in metal cutting and extreme wear applications to keep customers up and running longer against conditions such as corrosion and high temperatures. We bring together material science, technical expertise, innovation and customer service in a way that allows us to anticipate customers' needs and help them overcome problems and achieve their manufacturing objectives. Our standard and custom product offering spans metal cutting and wear applications including turning, milling, hole making, tooling systems and services, as well as specialized wear components and metallurgical powders. End users of the Company's metal cutting products include manufacturers engaged in a diverse array of industries including: transportation vehicles and components, machine tools and light and heavy machinery; airframe and aerospace components; and energy-related components for the oil and gas industry, as well as power generation. The Company’s wear and metallurgical powders are used by producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as road construction, mining, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply, and for aerospace and defense.Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a “year” refers to our fiscal year ending on June 30. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Kennametal Inc. and its subsidiaries.BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW Kennametal operates in two segments: Metal Cutting and Infrastructure. The Company's reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. Sales and operating income by segment are presented in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Item 7 of this Annual Report (MD&A). Additional segment data is provided in Note 21 of our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. METAL CUTTING The Metal Cutting segment develops and manufactures high performance tooling and metal cutting products and services and offers an assortment of standard and custom metal cutting solutions to diverse end markets, including General Engineering, Transportation, Aerospace & Defense and Energy. The products include milling, hole making, turning, threading and toolmaking systems used in the manufacture of airframes, aero engines, trucks and automobiles, ships and various types of industrial equipment. We leverage advanced manufacturing capabilities in combination with varying levels of customization to solve our customers’ toughest challenges and deliver improved productivity for a wide range of applications. Metal Cutting markets its products under the Kennametal®, WIDIA®, WIDIA Hanita® and WIDIA GTD® brands through its direct sales force, a network of independent and national distributors, integrated supplier channels and digitally. Application engineers and technicians are critical to the sales process and directly assist our customers with specified product design, selection, application and support.INFRASTRUCTURE Our Infrastructure segment produces engineered tungsten carbide and ceramic components, earth-cutting tools, and advanced metallurgical powders, primarily for the Earthworks, General Engineering, Energy and Aerospace & Defense end markets. These wear-resistant products include compacts, nozzles, frac seats and custom components used in oil and gas and petrochemical industries; rod blanks and abrasive water jet nozzles for general industries; earth cutting tools and systems used in underground mining, trenching and foundation drilling and road milling; tungsten carbide powders for the oil and gas, aerospace and process industries; high temperature critical wear components, tungsten penetrators and armor solutions for aerospace and defense; and ceramics used by the packaging industry for metallization of films and papers. We combine deep metallurgical and engineering expertise with advanced manufacturing capabilities, such as 3D printing, to deliver solutions that drive improved productivity for our customers. Infrastructure markets its products primarily under the Kennametal® brand and sells through a direct sales force as well as through distributors.4Table of ContentsINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS During 2025, we generated 60 percent of our consolidated sales in markets outside of the United States of America (U.S.), with principal international operations in Western Europe, China and India. We also operate manufacturing and distribution facilities in Israel, Latin America, South Africa and Vietnam, while serving customers through sales offices, agents and distributors in Europe and other parts of the world. While geographic diversification helps to minimize the sales and earnings effect of demand changes in any one particular region, our international operations are subject to normal risks of doing business globally, including tariffs, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in social, political and economic environments.Our international sales and long-lived assets are presented in Note 21 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Further information about the effects and risks of currency exchange rates are presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section, set forth in Item 7A of this Annual Report.ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We continually evaluate new opportunities to expand into new market areas, and to introduce new and/or complementary product offerings into new or existing areas where appropriate. We expect to continue to grow our business and further enhance our market position through the investment opportunities that exist within our core businesses, including potential acquisitions in the near term. During 2025, we completed the sale of a subsidiary located in Goshen, Indiana to a Chicago-based private equity firm and recognized a loss on divestiture of $1.5 million.RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Our major metallurgical raw materials consist of tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which are used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. Although an adequate supply of these raw materials currently exists, our major sources for raw materials are located abroad and prices fluctuate at times. We exercise great care in selecting, purchasing and managing the availability of raw materials utilizing a mix of long-term supply agreements coupled with spot purchases. Additionally, our internal tungsten recycling capability provides us access to additional sources of tungsten, and therefore, helps to mitigate our reliance on third parties. We also purchase steel bars and forgings for making toolholders and other tool parts, as well as for producing mining tools, rotary cutting tools and accessories. We purchase products for use in manufacturing processes and for resale from many suppliers located in the U.S. and abroad. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) Our R&D efforts focus on delivering innovations to our customers from both new product and process technology development. New product development provides solutions to our customers’ manufacturing challenges and productivity requirements. New process technology is developed and implemented in support of operational excellence to enhance product quality and efficiency at our plant sites. We use a disciplined framework, and have established “stage-gates,” or sequential tests to remove inefficiencies and accelerate commercial success. This framework is designed to accelerate and streamline development into a series of actions and decision points, integrating resource tasks to implement new and enhanced products and process technologies faster. Our stage-gate process ensures a strong linkage between verified customer requirements and corporate strategy and enables us to gain the full benefits of our investment in development work.We hold a number of patents and trademarks which, in the aggregate, are material to the operation of our businesses. The duration of our patent protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction. SEASONALITY Our business is affected by seasonal variations to varying degrees by summer road construction, traditional summer vacation shutdowns of customers’ plants and holiday shutdowns that affect our sales levels during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year.BACKLOG Our backlog of standard orders generally is not significant to our operations.COMPETITION As one of the world’s leading producers of tooling and metal cutting products, specialty wear-resistant components and ceramics, earth cutting tools and advanced metallurgical powders, we maintain a competitive position in major markets worldwide. We actively compete in the sale of all our products with several large global competitors and with many smaller niche businesses offering various capabilities to customers around the world. While several of our competitors are divisions of larger corporations, our industry remains largely fragmented, containing several hundred fabricators, toolmakers and niche specialty coating businesses. Many of our competitors operate relatively small facilities, producing a limited selection of tools while buying cemented tungsten carbide components from original producers of cemented tungsten carbide products, including Kennametal. We also supply coated solutions and other engineered wear-resistant products to both larger corporations and smaller niche businesses. Given the fragmentation, opportunities for consolidation exist from both U.S.-based and internationally-based firms, as well as among thousands of industrial supply distributors.5Table of ContentsThe principal competitive differentiators in our businesses include customer focused support and application expertise, custom and standard product innovation, product performance and quality, and our brand recognition. We derive competitive advantage from our premium brand positions, global presence, application expertise and ability to address unique customer needs with new and improved tools, innovative surface and wear-resistant solutions, highly engineered components, consistent quality, traditional and digital customer service and technical assistance capabilities, state-of-the-art manufacturing and multiple sales channels. With these strengths, we are able to sell products based on the value-added productivity we deliver to our customers, rather than competing solely on price.REGULATION From time to time, we are a party to legal claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which may relate to our operations or assets, including real, tangible or intellectual property assets. While we currently believe that the amount of ultimate liability, if any, we may face with respect to these actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur or if protracted litigation were to ensue, the effect on us could be material.Compliance with government laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials or pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position for the years covered by this Annual Report, nor is such compliance expected to have a material effect on us in the future.The operation of our business has exposed us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters. We are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain sites associated with our current or former operations.We establish and maintain accruals for estimated liabilities associated with certain environmental matters. As of June 30, 2025, the balance of these accruals was $11.0 million. These accruals represent anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues and are generally not discounted. We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular environmental matter is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. When a material loss contingency is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a material loss contingency is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. The accruals we have established for estimated environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs of addressing identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), other governmental agencies and by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) groups in which we are participating. The accrued liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the government or the courts on these matters.Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), under which we have been identified by the USEPA or other third party as a PRP with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and estimated liability associated with these sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals are adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at the sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.6Table of ContentsHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Employee Profile. We employed 8,124 people, including approximately 8,100 full-time employees, as of June 30, 2025. Approximately 2,500 employees were located in the U.S. and 5,600 were located in other parts of the world, principally Germany, India and China. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 1,900 of our employees were represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be generally good.Inclusion and Belonging. We are fully committed to inclusion and belonging (I&B) in the workplace. We continue to deploy our strategy and the supporting infrastructure to elevate and advance I&B across our global organization and instill accountability for our performance. Our I&B initiatives are guided by our I&B Steering Team, which was formed in fiscal 2023 and expanded in 2025. The Steering Team is led by five senior executives who are responsible for one of our I&B strategic pillars – awareness, acquisition, development, community and culture. Our I&B strategy is also championed by the Global Inclusion Council, which consists of cross-functional global leaders. Four regional inclusion councils covering the Americas, Asia Pacific, EMEA and India execute the strategies and provide a global perspective. We track key metrics to monitor the progress of our I&B strategy and goals and to identify areas for improvement across all levels of the organization. As part of our awareness initiatives in 2025, we have launched the redesign of the external career website to include a section on belonging, highlighting our culture. We continued to support our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to foster communication, mentorship and community among diverse groups within the Company. Additionally, throughout the year, we have incorporated educational opportunities to reinforce our ongoing commitment to employee well-being and inclusion.Health and Safety. Safety, including the health of our employees and contractors, is one of our core values and a priority across our global operations. We are committed to developing a world-class health and safety culture aimed at achieving zero injuries and illnesses. The long-term vision to achieving our world-class health and safety culture is formalized and communicated in our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Roadmap that consists of four focus areas – fatality and serious injury (FSI) prevention, incident prevention, leadership development and culture and environmental compliance and sustainability. The Company uses our EHS Management System, including an extensive list of apps, to enable streamlined collection, tracking and dissemination of key data related to our EHS standards and requirements. Along with each standard, we have developed a self-assessment used to evaluate performance and develop action plans for advancing on the EHS Roadmap. In 2025, we continued to achieve positive results in proactive risk identification and closure programs which drive our culture of eliminating hazards prior to potential incidents. Our total recordable incident rate (TRIR) performance was 0.42 in 2025 compared to 0.35 in 2024. Employee Development and Training. For the Company to grow, our employees must grow and develop continuously. We offer learning and development opportunities for all employees. In 2025, this included training for senior, mid-level and emerging leaders in role- and function-specific skills, such as coaching, feedback, collaboration, performance management, process improvement and sales training. We also offered our operational employees technical training through the Kennametal Knowledge Center.Supporting our learning and development efforts is our OneTeam learning management system (LMS). Available in multiple languages, OneTeam offers more than 20,000 online courses in an easy-to-use interface. Throughout 2025, over 4,000 employees accessed the LMS and completed over 18,800 courses. Training is offered to our employees in many different formats. Although not all training hours are tracked through OneTeam, over 12,700 hours of completed training were recorded in the system during 2025.Compensation and Benefits. The Company offers competitive compensation and benefits packages to build a qualified and motivated workforce and to meet their health and wellness needs. Our overall executive compensation philosophy is designed to attract, incentivize and retain high-performing talent. Executive compensation includes a mix of base salary, annual cash-based incentives under our Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and our equity-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).The AIP, which is largely based on the Company’s achievement of short-term financial and strategic goals, also includes a portion of non-financial metrics, including an individual performance component and a safety component for all executive leadership team members and other key senior leaders. Employee Engagement. To measure the effectiveness of our employee engagement strategy, we track key performance indicators such as our voluntary turnover rate. Our voluntary turnover rate was 7.7 percent in 2025 compared to 7.9 percent in 2024. We also conduct annual “Be Heard” employee engagement surveys to gather input and feedback on a wide range of categories including teamwork, inclusion and belonging, health and safety, ethical behavior and decision-making. We use the survey results, which are shared with employees, to refine employee engagement programs and develop new initiatives. In our most recent survey launched in April 2025, we had a response rate of 76 percent and showed an immaterial decrease in engagement scores across our global production and professional workforce. 7Table of ContentsAVAILABLE INFORMATION Our internet address is www.kennametal.com.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially affected by a number of factors. Our management regularly monitors the risks inherent in our business, with input from our Enterprise Risk Management process. In addition to real time monitoring, we periodically conduct a formal enterprise-wide risk assessment to identify factors and circumstances that might present significant risk to the Company. Many of these risks are discussed throughout this report. The risks below, however, are not exhaustive. We operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We are also subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors could emerge, and it is not possible to predict the outcome of all such risk factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following discussion details the material risk factors and uncertainties that we believe could cause Kennametal’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.8Table of ContentsGlobal Operational Risks:The conflict in the Middle East, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other conflicts could adversely affect our business. The conflict in the Middle East that began in October 2023 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 have resulted in disruptions within our business and throughout our supply chain. A significant escalation or expansion of these conflicts beyond the current geographic, political and economic scope and scale could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could exacerbate other risks. Such risks include, but are not limited to: an increase in the frequency and severity of the cybersecurity threats we and various third parties with whom we do business experience, unfavorable changes in exchange rates, delivery delays, price inflation in a wide variety of raw materials and components, widespread reductions in customer demand and increased logistical challenges. Public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. We face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases. A widespread healthcare crisis, such as an outbreak of a communicable disease could adversely affect the global economy and our business, our suppliers and our customers’ ability to conduct business for an indefinite period of time. For example, the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic negatively affected the global economy, disrupted financial markets, international trade, impacted qualified personnel availability, and significantly affected global supply chains, all of which had an effect on the Company and our end markets. The extent to which our business may be affected by public health threats or outbreaks in the future will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the duration of a pandemic or outbreak, impacts on economic activity, and the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Downturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business has historically been cyclical and subject to significant effect from economic downturns. Global economic downturns coupled with global financial and credit market disruptions have had a negative effect on our sales and profitability in the past. These events could contribute to weak end markets, a sharp drop in demand for our products and services, higher energy costs and commodity prices, and higher costs of borrowing and/or diminished credit availability. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for our business remain positive, we are unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength and pace or sustainability of economic development. Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely affect sales and earnings. We have manufacturing operations and assets located outside of the U.S., including but not limited to those in Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, South Africa and Vietnam. We also sell our products to customers and distributors located outside of the U.S. During the year ended June 30, 2025, 60 percent of our consolidated sales were derived from non-U.S. markets. These international operations are subject to a number of special risks, in addition to the risks that affect our domestic operations, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, overlap of different tax regimens, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulations, labor unrest, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, current and changing regulatory environments (including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the importation and exportation of products and raw materials), risk of failure of our foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust laws, trade regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in obtaining distribution support, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differences in the availability and terms of financing, social and political instability and unrest and risks of increased taxes and/or adverse tax consequences. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. To the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks, our international sales may be adversely affected, we may be subject to additional and unanticipated costs, and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.9Table of ContentsAdditional tax expense or exposures could affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to various taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or treaties, or in their application or interpretation, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.Implementation of tariffs and changes to or uncertainties related to tariffs and trade agreements could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods from a variety of countries and regions that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and has raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods from other countries. In response, many of these foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the U.S. or have enacted export restrictions on certain goods, including critical minerals, produced in their country. Uncertainties with respect to tariffs, trade agreements or any potential trade wars could negatively affect the global economy and demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in tariffs and trade barriers could also result in adverse changes in the cost and availability of our raw materials, most notably tungsten, and our ability to manufacture globally to support global sales which could lead to increased costs that we may not be able to effectively pass on to customers, each of which could materially adversely affect our operating margins, results of operations and cash flows.Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect results. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war, which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected. Changes in the regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety regulations, could subject us to increased compliance and manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Health and safety regulations. Certain of our products contain hard metals, including tungsten and cobalt. Hard metal dust is being studied for potential adverse health effects by organizations in several regions throughout the world, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Future studies on the health effects of hard metals may result in our products being classified as hazardous to human health, which could lead to new regulations in countries in which we operate that may restrict or prohibit the use of, and/or exposure to, hard metal dust. New regulation of hard metals could require us to change our operations, and these changes could affect the quality of our products and materially increase our costs.Environmental regulations. We are subject to various environmental laws, and any violation of, or our liabilities under, these laws could adversely affect us. Our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for noncompliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under these laws. We may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulations affecting the mining and drilling industries, utilities industry or the use of fossil fuels. Some of our principal customers are mining and drilling companies that supply coal, oil, gas or other fuels as a source of energy to utility companies or for transportation. The operations of these mining and drilling companies are geographically diverse and are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to these industries, including, without limitation, actions to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels, our customers’ operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with these regulations may also induce customers to discontinue or limit their operations and may discourage companies from developing new opportunities. As a result of these factors, demand for our mining- and drilling-related products could be substantially affected by regulations adversely affecting the mining and drilling industries or altering the fuel choices of utilities or in transportation. Our principal customers also include transportation original equipment manufacturers and tier suppliers engaged in the production of internal combustion engines. As a result of breakthrough technologies, changing consumer preferences or regulations designed to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, demand for our products could be negatively affected.10Table of ContentsClimate change and resulting legal or regulatory responses. There is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures may cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Such climate change may impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Growing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. The sale of metal cutting, mining, highway construction and other tools and related products as well as engineered components and advanced materials entails an inherent risk of product liability claims. We cannot give any assurances that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that our policies will cover any particular loss. Insurance can be expensive, and we may not always be able to purchase insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Business Strategy Risks:Our restructuring efforts may not have the intended effects. We have implemented restructuring and other actions to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency and position the Company for long-term profitable growth. However, there is no assurance that these efforts, or that any other actions that we have taken or may take in the future, will be sufficient to counter any future economic or industry disruptions. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur future restructuring charges or impairment charges, or that we will achieve all of the anticipated benefits from the restructuring actions we have taken or plan to take in the future. We may not be able to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions successfully. We may evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to strengthen or expand our business. We can give no assurances, however, that any acquisition opportunities will arise or if they do, that they will be consummated, or that additional financing, if needed, will be available on satisfactory terms. In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration of acquisitions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. Our failure to consummate an acquisition or effectively integrate newly acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected strategic growth and rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Impairment of goodwill could result in a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At June 30, 2025, goodwill totaled $282.7 million, or 11 percent of our total assets. Goodwill results from acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill. If future operating performance at our Metal Cutting reporting unit were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash impairment charge for goodwill. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our continued success depends on our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements and trade secret laws and, to a lesser extent, trademark and patent laws, to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. If one of our patents is infringed upon by a third party, we may need to devote significant time and financial resources to defend our rights with respect to such patent. We may not be successful in defending our patents. Similarly, while we do not knowingly infringe on the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to spend a significant amount of time and financial resources to resolve any infringement claims against us, and we may not be successful in defending our position or negotiating alternative remedies. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce or defend our intellectual property rights in proceedings initiated by us or brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 11Table of ContentsIf we are unable to retain our qualified management and employees, our business may be negatively affected. Our ability to provide high quality products and services depends in part on our ability to retain our skilled personnel in the areas of management, product engineering, servicing and sales. Competition for such personnel is intense, and our competitors can be expected to attempt to hire our management and skilled employees from time to time. In addition, our restructuring activities and strategies for growth have placed, and are expected to continue to place, increased demands on our management’s skills and resources. If we are unable to retain our management team and professional personnel, our customer relationships and level of technical expertise could be negatively affected, which may materially and adversely affect our business.Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to our restructuring initiatives, unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could affect our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. We compete directly and indirectly with other manufacturers and suppliers of metal cutting tools, engineered components and advanced materials. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater access to financial resources or be less leveraged than us. In addition, the industry in which our products are used is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive.Cybersecurity Risks:Failure of, or a breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology infrastructure (both on-premises and third-party managed) to achieve our business objectives. Despite security measures taken by us, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, supplier error, programming errors, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any disruption of our infrastructure could negatively affect our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any disruption could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate. Increased global information technology threats, vulnerabilities, and a rise in sophisticated and targeted international computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Any such breach in security could expose the Company and its employees, customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes, litigation and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential information relating to customers, employees, vendors and the extended supply chain or other parties is misappropriated from our computer system. We cannot assure that our ongoing focus on system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any cyber-attack or network disruption. We do not believe we have been the target of a material successful cyber-attack.Raw Material Risks:Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the prices and availability of raw materials. The raw materials we use for our products include tungsten ore concentrates and scrap carbide, which are used to make tungsten oxide, as well as compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt. We also purchase steel bars and forgings for making toolholders and other tool parts, as well as for producing mining tools, rotary cutting tools and accessories. A significant portion of our raw materials is supplied by sources outside of the U.S. The raw materials extraction industry is highly cyclical and at times pricing and supply can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including natural disasters, pandemics or public health issues, general economic and political conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, export restrictions enacted by foreign governments and currency exchange rate fluctuations. This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs. In an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions can affect how much of these price increases we can recover in the form of higher sales prices for our products. To the extent we are unable to pass on any raw material price increases to our customers, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, restrictions in the supply of tungsten, cobalt and other raw materials could adversely affect our operating results. If the prices for our raw materials increase or we are unable to secure adequate supplies of raw materials on favorable terms, our profitability could be impaired. If the prices for our raw materials decrease, we could face product pricing challenges.12Table of ContentsCapital and Credit-Related Risks:Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with a specified financial ratio. Our ability to meet the financial covenant or requirements in our revolving credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratio, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.ITEM 1B – UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C – CYBERSECURITYRisk Management and Strategy. We assess, identify and manage cybersecurity risks through a structured process. We rely on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework to guide our approach; covering risk identification, analysis, prioritization and treatment. We continuously monitor and mitigate identified risks, particularly those deemed significant to the Company, including, but not limited to: operational risk (i.e., disruption of business operations); intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk, which are tracked through our enterprise risk management program.We closely oversee risks associated with using third-party service providers. This involves evaluating their adherence to our security requirements, conducting technical assessments, monitoring their operational performance and establishing incident reporting protocols when our information is impacted by cyber incidents.Despite our efforts, we acknowledge the potential impact of cyber threats on our operations and business. While the Company has not experienced any significant risks from cyber threats to date, we recognize the potential consequences, including operational disruptions, legal costs, damage to our reputation and financial impacts. We remain vigilant and proactive in managing these risks. We deploy state-of-the-art technologies and services to help us identify and respond to security incidents, manage a 24/7 Security Operations Center and regularly test our preparedness for cyber incidents. These efforts enable us to effectively recognize and respond to low-impact incidents, avoiding their escalation to more problematic situations. Governance. The Board of Directors of the Company maintains oversight of cybersecurity risks, ensuring the effectiveness of our risk management processes. The Audit Committee is specifically tasked with monitoring cybersecurity risks, evaluating our approach to cybersecurity, assessing emerging threats and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to mitigate risks.Management, led by the Chief Information Security Officer (the “CISO”), plays a crucial role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. The CISO holds a Master of Science in Information Security and Assurance along with other technical certifications, has over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity and has extensive experience managing cybersecurity programs in multinational manufacturing companies. The IT Risk Management Committee, under guidance of the CISO, oversees the assessment and mitigation of identified risk. Regular reporting mechanisms keep the Board of Directors of the Company informed about our cybersecurity posture and emerging risks; enabling informed decision-making regarding cybersecurity strategy and resource allocation.ITEM 2 – PROPERTIESOur principal executive offices are located at 525 William Penn Place, Suite 3300, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15219.

Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a “year” is to our fiscal year ended June 30. Additionally, when used in this Annual Report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Kennametal Inc. and its subsidiaries.OVERVIEW Kennametal Inc. was founded based on a tungsten carbide technology breakthrough in 1938. The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1943 as a manufacturer of tungsten carbide metal cutting tooling and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1967. With more than 85 years of materials expertise, the Company is a global industrial technology leader, helping customers across the General Engineering, Transportation, Earthworks, Energy and Aerospace & Defense end markets manufacture with precision and efficiency. This expertise includes the development and application of tungsten carbides, ceramics, super-hard materials and solutions used in metal cutting and extreme wear applications to keep customers up and running longer against conditions such as corrosion and high temperatures. Our standard and custom product offering spans metal cutting and wear applications including turning, milling, hole making, tooling systems and services, as well as specialized wear components and metallurgical powders. End users of the Company's metal cutting products include manufacturers engaged in a diverse array of industries including: the manufacturers of transportation vehicles and components, machine tools and light and heavy machinery; airframe and aerospace components; and energy-related components for the oil and gas industry, as well as power generation. The Company’s wear and metallurgical powders are used by producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as road construction, mining, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply, and for aerospace and defense.Throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD&A), we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth (decline), constant currency regional sales growth (decline) and constant currency end market sales growth (decline). The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as details on their use and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Sales of $1,966.8 million in 2025 decreased 4 percent from $2,046.9 million in 2024, reflecting an organic sales decline of 4 percent and an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 1 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 1 percent.Operating income was $143.1 million, or 7.3 percent margin, compared with $170.2 million, or 8.3 percent margin, in the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower sales and production volumes, higher wages and general inflation, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $6 million and the net effect of increased tariffs of approximately $4 million. These factors were partially offset by restructuring benefits of approximately $23 million, pricing, lower raw material costs, an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $13 million from an advanced manufacturing production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act within the Infrastructure segment, and a net benefit of $12 million within the Infrastructure segment related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024. In 2025, the Metal Cutting and Infrastructure segments had operating margins of 7.1 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively.During the year ended June 30, 2025, we completed the sale of a subsidiary located in Goshen, Indiana to a Chicago-based private equity firm. The Company received $19 million in proceeds and recognized a loss on divestiture of $1.5 million during 2025. The proceeds are subject to customary post-closing adjustments as well as an EBITDA-based earn-out opportunity for Kennametal at the end of a three-year period.In February 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a $200 million, three-year share repurchase program outside of the Company's dividend reinvestment program. During 2025, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for $60 million.Uncertainties with respect to evolving global trade policies and tariffs have negatively affected the global economy. The Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products or an inability to effectively mitigate tariff-related cost increases through pricing and sourcing strategies. These factors could also increase the potential for future impairment charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairments. We have executed tariff mitigation actions including the implementation of surcharges on certain product sales and, where appropriate, rerouted internal supply chains. The unmitigated net effect from increased tariffs was approximately $4 million during fiscal 2025.18Table of ContentsAdditionally, our business has been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange and inflationary headwinds. We have been able to partially mitigate the effects of inflation, foreign currency exchange challenges and other disruptions through price increases on our products. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of these issues on our business, operating results or financial condition, but we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions and attempt to mitigate the negative effect to the extent possible.We reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.20 for 2025. EPS for the year was unfavorably affected by restructuring and related charges of $0.13 per share and a loss on divestiture of $0.01 per share. EPS in the prior year of $1.37 was unfavorably affected by restructuring and related charges of $0.13 per share.We generated cash flow from operating activities of $208.3 million in 2025 compared to $277.1 million during the prior year. Capital expenditures were $89.0 million and $107.6 million during 2025 and 2024, respectively. During 2025, the Company returned a total of $122 million to the shareholders through $60 million in share repurchases under the $200 million, three-year program and $62 million in dividends. For a discussion related to the results of operations, changes in financial condition and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2023 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2024.RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONSSALES Sales of $1,966.8 million in 2025 decreased 4 percent from $2,046.9 million in 2024, reflecting an organic sales decline of 4 percent and an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 1 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 1 percent.Our sales growth (decline) by end market and region are as follows:2025(in percentages)As ReportedConstant CurrencyEnd market sales growth (decline):Aerospace & Defense6%6%Energy(1)0General Engineering(5)(4)Transportation(6)(4)Earthworks(6)(7)Regional sales decline:Americas(4)%(3)%Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA)(4)(4)Asia Pacific(2)(1)GROSS PROFIT Gross profit decreased $29.0 million to $598.1 million in 2025 from $627.1 million in 2024. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower sales and production volumes, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $8 million and the net effect of increased tariffs of approximately $4 million. These factors were partially offset by pricing, lower raw material costs, an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $13 million from an advanced manufacturing production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act within the Infrastructure segment and a net benefit of $12 million within the Infrastructure segment related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024. The gross profit margin for 2025 was 30.4 percent compared to 30.6 percent in 2024.OPERATING EXPENSE Operating expense in 2025 was $430.8 million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 1 percent, from $433.2 million in 2024.We invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering high quality products to our customers. Research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled $44.4 million and $44.2 million for 2025 and 2024, respectively.19Table of ContentsRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES, NET In the June quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced an initiative to streamline our cost structure. Total restructuring and related charges for this program of $22.0 million, compared to a target of approximately $25 million, were recorded through June 30, 2025, consisting of $16.6 million in Metal Cutting and $5.5 million in Infrastructure. This action delivered annualized run rate pre-tax savings of approximately $35 million in 2025, in line with the target. This action was considered substantially complete as of December 31, 2024.In January 2025, we announced several actions to support the long-term competitiveness of the Company and to mitigate softer market conditions. Total restructuring and related charges for this program of $11.4 million, compared to a target of approximately $25 million, were recorded through June 30, 2025, consisting of $8.8 million in Metal Cutting and $2.6 million in Infrastructure. These actions delivered annualized run rate pre-tax savings of approximately $28 million by the end of fiscal 2025. We now expect total annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million in connection with these actions, exceeding the original target of $15 million. The Company substantially completed the closure of a facility in Greenfield, MA and the consolidation of facilities in Barcelona, Spain during 2025 as a part of these actions.During 2025, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $13.3 million, which consisted of $10.4 million in Metal Cutting and $2.8 million in Infrastructure. Of this amount, restructuring-related charges of $1.3 million were included in cost of goods sold and $0.2 million were included in operating expense.AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES Amortization expense was $10.8 million and $11.6 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively.INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense in 2025 was $24.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, compared to $26.5 million in 2024. The portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was less than 1 percent at June 30, 2025 and 2024. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2025 and 2024.OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET In 2025, other (income) expense, net was $13.8 million of other (income), net compared to $0.7 million in 2024. The increase of $13.1 million is primarily due to foreign currency transactions including preferential exchange rates in Bolivia, partially offset by higher net periodic pension expense.INCOME TAXES The effective tax rate for 2025 was 25.2 percent compared to 21.3 percent for 2024. The year-over-year change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to prior year adjustments that include a $7.8 million benefit related to a tax rate change in Switzerland, a $6.2 million benefit related to a change in unrecognized tax benefits and a $2.9 million charge to settle the Italian tax litigation. The current year effective tax rate reflects a benefit for the advanced manufacturing production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and $1.4 million for interest received to resolve an income tax dispute in India and geographical mix. Italian income tax litigation settlement. In 2012, we received an assessment from the Italian tax authority that denied certain tax deductions primarily related to our 2008 tax return. Attempts at negotiating a reasonable settlement with the tax authority were unsuccessful; and as a result, we decided to litigate the matter which was eventually settled during 2024. We continue to believe the assessment was baseless and that our 2008 tax return was compliant, in all material respects, with Italian income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, no income tax liability had been recorded in connection with this assessment in any period. During fiscal 2024, the Italian government launched a tax amnesty program aimed at reducing the number of tax disputes pending before the Italian courts. Pursuant to program guidelines, payments made to successfully resolve a dispute had to be received by the Italian government no later than September 30, 2023. Due to the prolonged amount of time the case had been pending, and the inherent costs and risks of further litigating the matter, we decided to negotiate a settlement with the Italian tax authority that resulted in an income tax charge of $2.9 million during fiscal 2024. With this settlement, the matter is officially closed. U.S. Income tax reform. On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which includes a broad range of tax reform provisions, was signed into law in the United States. We are in the process of assessing what impact the OBBBA will have on our business.NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO KENNAMETAL Net income attributable to Kennametal was $93.1 million, or $1.20 of earnings per diluted share (EPS) in 2025, compared to $109.3 million, or EPS of $1.37 in 2024. The decrease is a result of the factors previously discussed.BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW We operate in two reportable operating segments consisting of Metal Cutting and Infrastructure. Corporate expenses that are not allocated are reported in Corporate. Segment determination is based upon internal organizational structure, the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. See Note 21 of our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 20Table of ContentsOur sales and operating income by segment are as follows:(in thousands)20252024Sales:Metal Cutting$1,219,686 $1,280,781 Infrastructure747,159 766,118 Total sales$1,966,845 $2,046,899 Operating income:Metal Cutting$86,375 $132,573 Infrastructure58,465 39,857 Corporate(1,717)(2,207)Total operating income143,123 170,223 Interest expense24,930 26,472 Other (income) expense, net(13,811)(699)Income before income taxes$132,004 $144,450 METAL CUTTING(in thousands)20252024Sales$1,219,686 $1,280,781 Operating income86,375 132,573 Operating margin7.1 %10.4 %(in percentages)2025Organic sales decline(5)%Foreign currency exchange effect(1)Business days impact1 Sales decline(5)%2025(in percentages)As ReportedConstant CurrencyEnd market sales growth (decline):Aerospace & Defense2%3%General Engineering(6)(5)Transportation(6)(4)Energy(2)(1)Regional sales decline:Americas(4)%(2)%EMEA(7)(7)Asia Pacific(1)—21Table of ContentsIn 2025, Metal Cutting sales of $1,219.7 million decreased by $61.1 million, or 5 percent, from 2024. This was driven by an organic sales decline of 5 percent and an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of 1 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 1 percent. Aerospace & Defense end market sales increased in EMEA, and to a lesser extent in the Americas, as a result of our focused execution on our growth initiatives, the effects of which were partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific due to lower economic activity and certain production challenges at our OEM customers. Sales in the General Engineering end market declined in EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific due to lower manufacturing activity. Transportation end market sales decreased in EMEA due to the decline in vehicle production and project activity, partially offset by increases in Asia Pacific due to increased vehicle production and in the Americas resulting from our focused execution on our growth initiatives. Energy end market sales declined in EMEA due to reduced oil and gas activity, partially offset by an increase in sales in the Americas due to power generation. On a regional basis, sales in the Americas decreased primarily due to the General Engineering end market. A decline in EMEA is primarily due to the General Engineering, Transportation and Energy end markets as a result of a decline in vehicle production and lower manufacturing activity. Sales were flat in Asia Pacific due to an increase in the Transportation end market, as a result of increased vehicle production, offset by decreases in the General Engineering and Aerospace & Defense end markets. In 2025, Metal Cutting operating income was $86.4 million, a $46.2 million decrease from 2024. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower sales and production volumes, higher wages and general inflation, unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately $6 million, the net effect of increased tariffs of approximately $4 million and higher restructuring and related charges of approximately $2 million compared to the prior year. These factors were partially offset by pricing, restructuring benefits of approximately $17 million and lower raw material costs. Metal Cutting operating margin in 2025 was 7.1 percent compared to 10.4 percent in the prior year.

This was driven by an organic sales decline of 2 percent. Aerospace & Defense end market sales increased in EMEA and the Americas as a result of project timing and the execution of our growth initiatives. Energy end market sales increased in Asia Pacific as a result of project timing, the effects of which were offset by declines in the Americas due to lower global oil and gas activities as rig counts decreased year-over-year and order timing. Sales in the General Engineering end market decreased in the Americas and EMEA due to declines in industrial activity year-over-year, partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific from project timing. Earthworks end market sales decreased in the Americas due to lower mining activity, including customer mine closures and competitive pressures, partially offset by higher construction activity and an increase in sales in EMEA. Earthworks end market sales decreased in Asia due to lower customer capital investment from lower coal prices. On a regional basis, sales in the Americas decreased primarily due to a decline in the Earthworks end market from lower mining activity, including customer mine closures and competitive pressures, partially offset by higher construction activity. The General Engineering and Energy end markets decreased due to declines in industrial activity year-over-year, which was partially offset by the execution of our growth initiatives in the Aerospace & Defense end market. Sales in EMEA increased in the Aerospace & Defense end market from order timing and execution of our strategic initiatives as well as higher Earthworks demand, partially offset by a decline in the General Engineering end market from declines in industrial activity year-over-year and project timing. Sales decreased in Asia Pacific due to a decline in underground mining from lower customer capital investment from lower coal prices, partially offset by the General Engineering and Energy end markets.In 2025, Infrastructure operating income was $58.5 million, a $18.6 million increase from 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $13 million from an advanced manufacturing production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, a net benefit of $12 million related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024, restructuring benefits of approximately $7 million, lower raw material costs and pricing. These factors were partially offset by lower sales and production volumes, higher wages and general inflation and a loss from divestiture of approximately $2 million related to the sale of a subsidiary in Goshen, IN. Infrastructure operating margin in 2025 was 7.8 percent compared to 5.2 percent in the prior year. CORPORATE(in thousands)20252024Corporate expense$(1,717)$(2,207)In 2025, Corporate expense decreased $0.5 million from 2024.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flow from operations is the primary source of funding for working capital requirements, reinvesting in our business through capital expenditures and returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year ended June 30, 2025, cash flow provided by operating activities was $208.3 million.During fiscal 2022, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement is a five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, which we use to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans of up to $700.0 million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be (1) Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for any borrowings in euros, pounds sterling, yen, and U.S. dollars respectively, plus an applicable margin, (2) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus an applicable margin, or (3) fixed as negotiated by us. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2027.The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including one financial covenant: a maximum leverage ratio where debt, net of domestic cash in excess of $25 million and sixty percent of the unrestricted cash held outside of the United States, must be less than or equal to 3.75 times trailing twelve months EBITDA, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses.As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement and we had no borrowings outstanding and $700.0 million of availability. 23Table of ContentsBorrowings on other lines of credit and notes payable were $1.0 million and $1.4 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The lines of credit represented short-term borrowings under credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate. The availability of the credit lines, translated into U.S. dollars at June 30, 2025 exchange rates, totaled $62.1 million.For the year ended June 30, 2025, average daily borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement were approximately $5.4 million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 5.5 percent for the year ended June 30, 2025. Based upon our debt structure at June 30, 2025 and 2024, less than 1 percent of our debt was exposed to variable rates of interest. We consider the majority of the $1.0 billion unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. With regard to these unremitted earnings, we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws. With regard to the small portion of unremitted earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested, we maintain a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes. The deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries not permanently reinvested is $3.8 million as of June 30, 2025. At June 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $140.5 million. Total Kennametal Shareholders’ equity was $1,284.0 million and total debt was $597.8 million. Our current senior credit ratings are considered investment grade. We believe that our current financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide us with access to the capital markets. We continue to closely monitor our liquidity position and the condition of the capital markets, as well as the counterparty risk of our credit providers.Cash generated from operations is expected to meet our planned capital expenditures of approximately $90 million and expected dividend payments in fiscal 2026. There can be no assurance, however, that we will generate cash from operations in line with our expectations, or that these projections will remain constant throughout fiscal 2026. If cash generated from operations is not sufficient to support these activities, we may be required to use existing cash and cash equivalents, reduce capital expenditures or borrow under the Credit Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available borrowings are sufficient to meet both the short-term and long-term capital needs of the Company.The following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of June 30, 2025: Contractual Obligations (in thousands)  Total20262027-20282029-2030ThereafterLong-term debt, including current maturities(1)$692,025 $22,275 $344,550 $16,800 $308,400 Other lines of credit and notes payable1,004 1,004 — — — Pension benefit payments(2)56,801 112,776 107,540 (2)Postretirement benefit payments(2)973 1,706 1,706 1,430 (2)Operating leases(3)52,838 14,116 17,188 6,992 14,542 Purchase obligations(4)42,900 42,880 20 — — Unrecognized tax benefits(5)1,947 103 1,515 166 163 Total  $138,152 $477,755 $132,928 (1)Long-term debt includes interest obligations of $92.0 million and excludes debt issuance costs of $2.5 million.

The lease has not yet commenced as the facility has yet to be constructed and the Company does not have the right to use the property until the future handover date. The future cash flows related to this lease are not included in the table.(4)Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments for materials, supplies and machinery and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. Purchase obligations with variable price provisions were determined assuming market prices as of June 30, 2025 remain constant.(5)Unrecognized tax benefits are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. These amounts include interest of $0.2 million and a penalty of $0.1 million accrued related to such positions as of June 30, 2025. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.Other Commercial Commitments (in thousands)Total20262027-20282029-2030ThereafterStandby letters of credit$4,539 $3,459 $1,080 $— $— Guarantees10,527 2,828 7,699 — — Total$15,066 $6,287 $8,779 $— $— 24Table of ContentsThe standby letters of credit relate to insurance and other activities.

In February 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a $200 million, three-year share repurchase program outside of the Company's dividend reinvestment program. During 2025, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for $60 million.Dividends. In fiscal 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in each quarter for a total of $62 million in dividends returned to the shareholders.Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. During 2025, cash flow provided by operating activities was $208.3 million, compared to $277.1 million in 2024. During 2025, cash flow provided by operating activities consisted of net income and non-cash items amounting to $247.5 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of $39.2 million. Contributing to the change in certain assets and liabilities were an increase in inventories of $17.4 million, decrease in accrued income taxes of $12.3 million, a decrease in accrued pension and postretirement benefits of $7.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.2 million and a decrease in other of $5.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $9.1 million.During 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was $277.1 million consisting of net income and non-cash items amounting to $278.2 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of $1.1 million. Contributing to the change in certain assets and liabilities were a decrease in accrued income taxes of $16.2 million, a decrease in accrued pension and postretirement benefits of $9.5 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $2.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $36.8 million.Cash Flow Used for Investing Activities. Cash flow used for investing activities was $61.8 million for 2025, a decrease of $47.6 million, compared to $109.4 million in 2024. During 2025, cash flow used for investing activities included capital expenditures, net of $87.1 million, which consisted primarily of equipment upgrades, proceeds from a divestiture of $18.7 million and proceeds from insurance recoveries of $11.8 million, partially offset by an outflow of $5.2 million which includes an investment in a strategic partnership with Toolpath Labs, Inc.Cash flow used for investing activities was $109.4 million for 2024 and included capital expenditures, net of $102.1 million, which consisted primarily of equipment upgrades, the acquisition of a business for $4.0 million and an investment in a strategic partnership with ModuleWorks GmbH.Cash Flow Used for Financing Activities. Cash flow used for financing activities was $133.9 million for 2025 compared to $141.7 million in 2024. During 2025, cash flow used for financing activities primarily included $61.9 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders, $60.1 million in common shares repurchased, primarily under the share repurchase program and $7.1 million of the effect of employee benefit and stock plans and dividend reinvestment. Cash flow used for financing activities was $141.7 million for 2024 and included $65.6 million in common shares repurchased, primarily under the share repurchase program, $63.4 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders and $10.0 million of the effect of employee benefit and stock plans and dividend reinvestment.FINANCIAL CONDITION At June 30, 2025, total assets were $2,545.4 million, an increase of $41.7 million from $2,503.8 million at June 30, 2024. Total liabilities increased $5.6 million from $1,215.2 million at June 30, 2024 to $1,220.8 million at June 30, 2025.Working capital was $616.9 million at June 30, 2025, an increase of $30.3 million from $586.6 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in inventories of $23.6 million, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $12.6 million, an increase in other current assets of $7.9 million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of $4.6 million. Partially offsetting these items was a decrease in accounts receivable of $7.4 million, an increase in other current liabilities of $5.0 million and an increase in accounts payable of $4.4 million. Currency exchange rate effects increased working capital by a total of approximately $22.5 million, the effects of which are included in the aforementioned changes.Property, plant and equipment, net decreased $18.1 million from $938.1 million at June 30, 2024 to $919.9 million at June 30, 2025, primarily due to depreciation of $125.7 million and disposals of $1.8 million, partially offset by capital additions of $89.0 million and a currency exchange effect of approximately $22.0 millionAt June 30, 2025, other assets were $586.2 million, an increase of $23.1 million from $563.1 million at June 30, 2024. The primary drivers for the increase were an increase in other of 12.9 million, including an investment in a strategic partnership with Toolpath Labs, Inc, an increase in goodwill of 11.2 million and an increase in deferred income taxes of $11.1 million. Partially offsetting these items was amortization of intangibles of $10.8 million. Currency exchange rate effects increased other assets by a total of approximately $23.9 million, the effects of which are included in the aforementioned changes.25Table of ContentsKennametal Shareholders’ equity was $1,284.0 million at June 30, 2025, an increase of $34.1 million from $1,249.9 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to net income attributable to Kennametal of $93.1 million, other comprehensive income attributable to Kennametal of $47.9 million and capital stock issued under employee benefit and stock plans of $14.1 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid to Kennametal Shareholders of $61.9 million and the repurchase of capital stock of $60.1 million primarily under the share repurchase program.EFFECTS OF INFLATION Rising costs, including the cost of certain raw materials, continue to affect our operations throughout the world. We experienced higher levels of inflation in 2025 and expect inflation will continue to be a challenge in fiscal 2026. We will strive to minimize the effects through cost containment, productivity improvements and price increases.DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As part of our financial reporting process, our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We use relevant information available at the end of each period to make these judgments and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies.Revenue Recognition. The Company's contracts with customers are comprised of purchase orders, and for larger customers, may also include long-term agreements. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. These contracts with customers typically relate to the manufacturing of products, which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied when control of the product passes to the customer. The Company considers the timing of right to payment, transfer of risk and rewards, transfer of title, transfer of physical possession and customer acceptance when determining when control transfers to the customer. As a result, revenue is generally recognized at a point in time - either upon shipment or delivery - based on the specific shipping terms in the contract. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, customary local commercial terms and the type of transportation. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as activities to fulfill a promise to transfer a product to a customer and as such, costs incurred are recorded when the related revenue is recognized. Payment for products is due within a limited time period after shipment or delivery, typically within 30 to 90 calendar days of the respective invoice dates. The Company does not generally offer extended payment terms.Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers, primarily distributor customers, have an element of variable consideration that is estimated when revenue is recognized under the contract. Variable consideration primarily includes volume incentive rebates, which are based on achieving a certain level of purchases and other performance criteria as established by our distributor programs. These rebates are estimated based on projected sales to the customer and accrued as a reduction of net sales as they are earned. The majority of our products are consumed by our customers or end users in the manufacture of their products. Historically, we have experienced very low levels of returned products and do not consider the effect of returned products to be material. We have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns.We warrant that products sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed, used and maintained. This warranty terminates 30 days after delivery of the product to the customer and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse, abuse, neglect or improper storage, handling or maintenance. Products may be returned to Kennametal only after inspection and approval by Kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from Kennametal. We have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above.The Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events that have occurred other than the passage of time. The Company also records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligation. The Company did not have any material remaining performance obligations, contract assets or liabilities as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. The Company pays sales commissions related to certain contracts, which qualify as incremental costs of obtaining a contract. However, the Company applies the practical expedient that allows an entity to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. These costs are recorded within operating expense in our consolidated statements of income.26Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service (substantive vesting period). Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. We utilize the Black-Scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all stock option awards. Time vesting stock units are valued at the market value of the stock on the grant date. Performance vesting stock units with a market condition are valued using a Monte Carlo model.Accounting for Contingencies. We accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss. The significant contingencies affecting our consolidated financial statements include environmental, health and safety matters and litigation.Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Changes in circumstances include technological advances, changes in our business model, capital structure, economic conditions or operating performance. Our evaluation is performed at the asset group level, based upon, among other things, our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate. When the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. We apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset group.Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. As of June 30, 2025, goodwill of $282.7 million was allocated only to the Metal Cutting reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment test during the June quarter in connection with our annual planning process unless there are impairment indicators that warrant a test prior to that quarter. In 2025, we performed a quantitative "Step 1" analyses using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. We can use a qualitative test, known as "Step 0," or a quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In 2024, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the quantitative analysis.Under the Step 0 test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing the Step 1 quantitative test is necessary.Step 1 of the quantitative test requires comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. Otherwise, the Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. We apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to measure the fair value of our equity under the income approach. A terminal value utilizing a constant growth rate of cash flows is used to calculate a terminal value after the explicit projection period. The estimates and assumptions used in our calculations include revenue and gross margin growth rates, expected capital expenditures to determine projected cash flows, expected tax rates and an estimated discount rate to determine present value of expected cash flows. These estimates are based on historical experiences, our projections of future operating activity and our weighted average cost of capital (WACC). In order to determine the discount rate, the Company uses a market perspective WACC approach. The WACC is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. Therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the Company, may have an effect on future calculations of estimated fair value. 27Table of ContentsFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Certain events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately affect the estimated fair values of the Metal Cutting reporting unit may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, a continued decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in customer demand or other pressures adversely affecting our long-term sales trends, (ii) inability to achieve the sales from our strategic growth initiatives, and (iii) increased pressure on margins due to higher inflationary costs or other factors. A significant change in any of these factors may increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment in a future period.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees and retirees. Accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over either the expected work life of employees or over the average life of participants participating in these plans, depending on plan status and on participant population. This estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age. Differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans.In the valuation of our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, management utilizes various assumptions. Our discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for a plan’s projected benefit payments. This rate can fluctuate based on changes in the corporate bond yields. At June 30, 2025, a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would be immaterial to our pre-tax income.The long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans, coupled with the current and short-term mix of the investment portfolio. The historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes. This return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors.Future compensation rates, withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information. These assumptions are not expected to significantly change. Mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables.We expect to contribute approximately $7.3 million and $1.0 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in 2026. Expected pension contributions in 2026 are primarily for international plans.Inventories. We use the last-in, first-out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our U.S. inventories, and they are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the remainder of our inventories is measured using approximate costs determined on the first-in, first-out basis or using the average cost method, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. When market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value, a lower of cost or net realizable value provision or a lower of cost or market provision, as applicable, is recorded. Once inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete, a new cost basis is established that is not subsequently written back up in future periods. Income Taxes. The Company’s provision for income taxes is calculated based on income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management’s estimates and judgments. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is “more likely than not” that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of June 30, 2025, the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss and other carryforwards, pension benefits, accrued employee benefits and inventory. In the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase in the valuation allowance would be required. In the event we were to determine that we are able to use our deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance is recorded, a decrease in the valuation allowance would be required.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSThe Company did not adopt any new accounting standards during 2025 that have had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 28Table of ContentsRECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report and reconciliations to the most closely related GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and results and a supplemental measure of year-over-year results. The non-GAAP financial measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes and may, therefore, also be useful to investors as they are a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP financial measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.Organic sales growth (decline). Organic sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, business days and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. We report organic sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels.Constant currency end market sales growth (decline). Constant currency end market sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by end market excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth (decline), constant currency end market sales growth (decline) does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying end market trends by providing end market sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. We report constant currency end market sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels. Constant currency regional sales growth (decline). Constant currency regional sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by region excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth (decline), constant currency regional sales growth (decline) does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying regional trends by providing regional sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. We report constant currency regional sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels.Reconciliations of organic sales decline to sales decline are as follows:Year ended June 30, 2025Metal CuttingInfrastructureTotalOrganic sales decline(5)%(2)%(4)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(1)—(1)Business days effect(9)1—1Sales decline(5)%(2)%(4)%Reconciliations of constant currency end market sales (decline) growth to end market sales (decline) growth, are as follows:Metal CuttingYear ended June 30, 2025EnergyGeneral EngineeringAerospace & DefenseTransportationConstant currency end market sales (decline) growth(1)%(5)%3%(4)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(1)(1)(1)(2)End market sales (decline) growth(6)(2)%(6)%2%(6)%29Table of ContentsInfrastructureYear ended June 30, 2025EnergyGeneral EngineeringAerospace & DefenseEarthworksConstant currency end market sales (decline) growth—%(3)%16%(7)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)—(1)—1End market sales (decline) growth(6)—%(4)%16%(6)%TotalYear ended June 30, 2025EnergyGeneral EngineeringAerospace & DefenseTransportationEarthworksConstant currency end market sales (decline) growth—%(4)%6%(4)%(7)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(1)(1)—(2)1End market sales (decline) growth(6)(1)%(5)%6%(6)%(6)%Reconciliations of constant currency regional sales (decline) growth to reported regional sales (decline) growth, are as follows:Year Ended June 30, 2025AmericasEMEAAsia PacificMetal CuttingConstant currency regional sales decline(2)%(7)%—%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(2)—(1)Regional sales decline(7)(4)%(7)%(1)%InfrastructureConstant currency regional sales (decline) growth(4)%4%(3)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(1)1—Regional sales (decline) growth(7)(5)%5%(3)%TotalConstant currency regional sales decline(3)%(4)%(1)%Foreign currency exchange effect(5)(1)—(1)Regional sales decline(7)(4)%(4)%(2)%(5) Foreign currency exchange effect is calculated by dividing the difference between current period sales and current period sales at prior period foreign exchange rates by prior period sales.(6) Aggregate sales for all end markets sum to the sales amount presented on Kennametal's consolidated financial statements.(7) Aggregate sales for all regions sum to the sales amount presented on Kennametal's consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. As part of our financial risk management program, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and, therefore, hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes. We may use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results. Our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow, allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations. See Notes 2 and 6 of our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.We are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and, in the event of nonperformance, to market risk for changes in currency exchange rates, as well as settlement risk. We manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.30Table of ContentsIncluded below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical 10 percent weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar and its effects on the June 30, 2025 currency exchange rates. We compared our contractual derivative arrangements in effect at June 30, 2025 to the hypothetical foreign exchange in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on pre-tax income and accumulated other comprehensive loss. Our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting.Also included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical 10 percent change on the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements as of June 30, 2025. We compared our borrowing arrangements in effect at June 30, 2025 to the hypothetical interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense, pre-tax income and accumulated other comprehensive loss. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Certain currency forward contracts that hedge significant cross-border intercompany loans are considered as other derivatives and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting. Range forward contracts (a transaction where both a put option is purchased and a call option is sold) are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge anticipated cash flows from cross-border intercompany sales of products and services. At June 30, 2025, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar would have changed accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by $0.3 million and pre-tax income by $0.4 million. DEBT, REVOLVING AND OTHER LINES OF CREDIT AND NOTES PAYABLE At June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had $597.8 million and $597.4 million, respectively, of outstanding debt, including revolving and other lines of credit and notes payable. The effective interest rate was 3.7 percent as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Based upon our debt structure at June 30, 2025 and 2024, less than 1 percent of our debt was exposed to variable rates of interest. A hypothetical change of 10 percent in market interest rates from June 30, 2025 levels would be immaterial.CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in 2025 and decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.11 in 2024. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material effect on future earnings in the short term and long term.31Table of ContentsITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 using the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.32Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kennametal Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kennametal Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.33Table of ContentsCritical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Provision for Income TaxesAs described in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $33.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2025. The Company’s provision for income taxes is calculated based on income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management’s estimates and judgments. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the provision for income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities, including the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as management’s assessment of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes, including controls over accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the accuracy of the provision for income taxes, which included the effective tax rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences, (ii) evaluating whether the data utilized in the calculations of the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities were appropriate and consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, (iii) evaluating the identification of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonableness of the more likely than not determination in consideration of court decisions, legislative actions, statutes of limitations, and developments in tax examinations by jurisdiction, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on expectations of the ability to utilize its tax attributes through testing of historical and estimated future taxable income. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments and estimates related to the application of foreign and domestic tax laws and regulations. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaAugust 12, 2025We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.34Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME Year

NATURE OF OPERATIONSWith more than 85 years of materials expertise, the Company is a global industrial technology leader, helping customers across the General Engineering, Transportation, Earthworks, Energy and Aerospace & Defense end markets manufacture with precision and efficiency. This expertise includes the development and application of tungsten carbides, ceramics, super-hard materials and solutions used in metal cutting and extreme wear applications to keep customers up and running longer against conditions such as corrosion and high temperatures.Our standard and custom product offering spans metal cutting and wear applications including turning, milling, hole making, tooling systems and services, as well as specialized wear components and metallurgical powders. End users of the Company's metal cutting products include manufacturers engaged in a diverse array of industries including: the manufacturers of transportation vehicles and components, machine tools and light and heavy machinery; airframe and aerospace components; and energy-related components for the oil and gas industry, as well as power generation. The Company’s wear and metallurgical powders are used by producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as road construction, mining, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply, and for aerospace and defense.Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a “year” is to a fiscal year ended June 30. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Kennametal Inc. and its subsidiaries. NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The summary of our significant accounting policies is presented below to assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements.PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As part of our financial reporting process, our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develop estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash investments having original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market funds and bank deposits at June 30, 2025.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE We market our products to a diverse customer base throughout the world. Trade credit is extended based upon periodically updated evaluations of each customer’s ability to satisfy its obligations. We record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience, industry concentrations of credit risk, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and forward-looking information. INVENTORIES We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our United States (U.S.) inventories, and they are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the remainder of our inventories is measured using approximate costs determined on the first-in, first-out basis or using the average cost method, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. When market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value, a lower of cost or net realizable value provision or a lower of cost or market provision, as applicable, is recorded. Once inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete, a new cost basis is established that is not subsequently written back up in future periods. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Retirements and disposals are removed from cost and accumulated depreciation accounts, with the gain or loss reflected in operating income. Interest related to the construction of major facilities is capitalized as part of the construction costs and is depreciated over the facilities' estimated useful lives. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is generally computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: building and improvements over 15-40 years; machinery and equipment over 4-15 years; furniture and fixtures over 5-10 years and computer hardware and software over 3-5 years.39Table of ContentsLONG-LIVED ASSETS We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and intangible assets that are amortized, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable. Changes in circumstances include technological advances, changes in our business model, capital structure, economic conditions or operating performance. Our evaluation is performed at the asset group level, based upon, among other things, our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate. When the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. We apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset group.GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. We perform our annual impairment test during the June quarter in connection with our annual planning process unless there are impairment indicators that warrant a test prior to that quarter. As of June 30, 2025, only the Metal Cutting reporting unit has goodwill recorded. We completed annual tests of goodwill impairment and recorded no impairments during 2025, 2024 or 2023 for our Metal Cutting reporting unit. In 2025 and 2023, we performed quantitative "Step 1" analyses using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. We can use a qualitative test, known as "Step 0," or a quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In 2024, we elected to implement Step 0 and were not required to conduct the quantitative analysis. We apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The majority of our intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, while certain customer-related intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated method. Identifiable assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS We sponsor these types of benefit plans for certain employees and retirees. Accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over either the expected work life of employees or over the average life of participants participating in these plans, depending on plan status and on participant population. This estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age. Differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans.In the valuation of our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, management utilizes various assumptions. Discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for a plan’s projected benefit payments. This rate can fluctuate based on changes in the corporate bond yields. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans, coupled with the current and short-term mix of the investment portfolio. The historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes. This return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors.Future compensation rates, withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information. These assumptions are not expected to significantly change. Mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables.EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while diluted earnings per share is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur related to the issuance of capital stock under stock option grants, performance awards and restricted stock units. The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share relates solely to the effect of capital stock options, performance awards and restricted stock units.The following tables provide the computation of diluted shares outstanding:(in thousands)202520242023Weighted-average shares outstanding during period77,264 79,390 80,803 Add: Unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units630 575 599 Number of shares on which diluted earnings per share is calculated77,894 79,965 81,402 Unexercised stock options with an exercise price greater than the average market price and restricted stock units not included in the computation because they were anti-dilutive274 396 642 40Table of ContentsREVENUE RECOGNITION The Company's contracts with customers are comprised of purchase orders, and for larger customers, may also include long-term agreements. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. These contracts with customers typically relate to the manufacturing of products, which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied when control of the product passes to the customer. The Company considers the timing of right to payment, transfer of risk and rewards, transfer of title, transfer of physical possession and customer acceptance when determining when control transfers to the customer. As a result, revenue is generally recognized at a point in time - either upon shipment or delivery - based on the specific shipping terms in the contract. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, customary local commercial terms and the type of transportation. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as activities to fulfill a promise to transfer a product to a customer and as such, costs incurred are recorded when the related revenue is recognized. Payment for products is due within a limited time period after shipment or delivery, typically within 30 to 90 calendar days of the respective invoice dates. The Company does not generally offer extended payment terms.Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers, primarily distributor customers, have an element of variable consideration that is estimated when revenue is recognized under the contract. Variable consideration primarily includes volume incentive rebates, which are based on achieving a certain level of purchases and other performance criteria as established by our distributor programs. These rebates are estimated based on projected sales to the customer and accrued as a reduction of net sales as they are earned. The majority of our products are consumed by our customers or end users in the manufacture of their products. Historically, we have experienced very low levels of returned products and do not consider the effect of returned products to be material. We have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns.We warrant that products sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed, used and maintained. This warranty terminates 30 days after delivery of the product to the customer and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse, abuse, neglect or improper storage, handling or maintenance. Products may be returned to Kennametal only after inspection and approval by Kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from Kennametal. We have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above.The Company records a contract asset when it has a right to payment from a customer that is conditioned on events that have occurred other than the passage of time. The Company also records a contract liability when customers prepay but the Company has not yet satisfied its performance obligation. The Company did not have any material remaining performance obligations, contract assets or liabilities as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. The Company pays sales commissions related to certain contracts, which qualify as incremental costs of obtaining a contract. However, the Company applies the practical expedient that allows an entity to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. These costs are recorded within operating expense in our consolidated statements of income.SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS All fees billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as a component of sales. All costs associated with shipping and handling are classified as a component of cost of goods sold.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service (substantive vesting period). Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. We utilize the Black-Scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all stock option awards. Time vesting stock units are valued at the market value of the stock on the grant date. Performance vesting stock units with a market condition are valued using a Monte Carlo model.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs of $44.4 million, $44.2 million and $43.1 million in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were expensed as incurred. These costs are included in operating expense in the consolidated statements of income.41Table of ContentsINCOME TAXES The Company’s provision for income taxes is calculated based on income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management’s estimates and judgments. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities, including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the future income tax effects (using enacted tax laws and rates) of differences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, and projections of future profitability within the carry forward period, including taxable income from tax planning strategies. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of the deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Upon changes in facts and circumstances, we may conclude that deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is currently recorded may not be realized, resulting in a charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES As part of our financial risk management program, we use certain derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and, therefore, hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results. Our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow, allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations. We account for derivative instruments as a hedge of the related asset, liability, firm commitment or anticipated transaction, when the derivative is specifically designated as a hedge of such items. We measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item. Certain currency forward contracts hedging significant cross-border intercompany loans are considered other derivatives and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. CASH FLOW HEDGES Range forward contracts (a transaction where both a put option is purchased and a call option is sold) are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge anticipated cash flows from cross-border intercompany sales of products and services. Gains and losses realized on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are recognized as a component of cost of goods sold when the underlying sale of products or services is recognized into earnings.NET INVESTMENT HEDGES We designate financial instruments as net investment hedges from time to time to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our net investment in foreign currency-based subsidiaries. The remeasurements of these non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss. Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss unless we complete or substantially complete liquidation or disposal of our investment in the underlying foreign operations.CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of international operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates throughout the year. The resulting net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The local currency is the functional currency of most of our locations.Losses of $1.3 million, $4.1 million and $3.9 million from currency transactions were included in other (income) expense, net in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.NOTE 3 — SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURESYear ended June 30 (in thousands)202520242023Cash paid during the period for:Interest$24,768 $26,382 $28,192 Income taxes58,646 48,518 43,730 Supplemental disclosure of non-cash information:Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of property, plant and equipment3,094 (4,497)(2,248)42Table of ContentsNOTE 4 —SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMWe have a supplier finance program managed through two global financial institutions under which we agree to pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices from our participating suppliers on the invoice due date. We, or the global financial institutions, may terminate our agreements at any time upon 30 days written notice. We do not provide any forms of guarantees under these agreements. Supplier participation in the program is solely up to the supplier. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program, and their participation has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. The payment terms that we have with our suppliers under this program are considered commercially reasonable. As of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the program were $17.3 million and $26.1 million, respectively, and were recorded within trade accounts payable.The following rollforward table indicates the Company's outstanding obligations under the supplier finance program for the year ended June 30, 2025: Year Ended June 30 (in thousands)2025Confirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of the year $26,059 Invoices confirmed during the year66,035 Confirmed invoices paid during the year(74,788)Confirmed obligations outstanding at the end of the year$17,306 NOTE 5 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels to prioritize the inputs used in valuations, as defined below:Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable.As of June 30, 2025, the fair values of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized as follows: (in thousands)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalAssets:Derivatives (1)$— $88 $— $88 Total assets at fair value$— $88 $— $88 Liabilities:Derivatives (1)$— $81 $— $81 Total liabilities at fair value$— $81 $— $81 43Table of ContentsAs of June 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized as follows:(in thousands)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalAssets:Derivatives (1)$— $91 $— $91 Total assets at fair value$— $91 $— $91 Liabilities:Derivatives (1)$— $89 $— $89 Total liabilities at fair value$— $89 $— $89   (1) Currency derivatives are valued based on observable market spot and forward rates and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.There have been no changes in classification and transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy in the current period.

The notional amount of the contracts translated into U.S. dollars at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 was $4.7 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The time value component of the fair value of range forward contracts is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 44Table of ContentsThe following represents losses, net of tax, related to cash flow hedges:(in thousands)20252024Unrealized gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss)$771 $(26)NET INVESTMENT HEDGESAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had certain foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans payable with total aggregate principal amounts of ¥82.3 million and ¥279.7 million, respectively, designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our net investment in our China-based subsidiaries. Losses of $2.2 million and $0.2 million were recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income (loss) as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively.As of June 30, 2025, the foreign currency-denominated intercompany loans payable designated as net investment hedges consisted of:InstrumentNotional (CNY in thousands)(2)Notional (USD in thousands)(2)MaturityForeign currency-denominated intercompany loan payable¥82,304 $11,487 March 2026(2) Includes principal and accrued interest.NOTE 7 — INVENTORIESInventories consisted of the following at June 30: (in thousands)20252024Finished goods$328,243 $310,965 Work in process and powder blends225,726 216,203 Raw materials90,257 77,050 Inventories at current cost644,226 604,218 Less: LIFO valuation(105,989)(89,586)Total inventories$538,237 $514,632 We used the LIFO method of valuing inventories for approximately 34 percent and 33 percent of total inventories at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.NOTE 8 — GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSAs of June 30, 2025, goodwill of $282.7 million was allocated to the Metal Cutting reporting unit.

Estimated amortization expense for 2026 through 2030 is $10.6 million, $9.1 million, $8.0 million, $7.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively.NOTE 9 — LEASESAt the inception of our contracts, we determine if the contract is or contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement. For leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined considering factors such as the lease term, our credit rating and the economic environment of the location of the lease as of the commencement date.We account for non-lease components separately from lease components. These costs often relate to the payments for a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and other operating costs in addition to base rent. We also generally do not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease costs associated with leases of less than 12 months were $7.7 million, $5.9 million and $7.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.46Table of ContentsAs a lessee, we have various operating lease agreements primarily related to real estate, vehicles and office and plant equipment. Our real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing, warehousing, office and administration facilities, represent a majority of our lease liability. Our lease payments are largely fixed. Any variable lease payments, including utilities, common area maintenance and repairs and maintenance, are expensed during the period incurred. Variable lease costs were immaterial for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. A majority of our real estate leases include options to extend the lease and options to early terminate the lease. Leases with an early termination option generally involve a termination payment. We review all options to extend, terminate, or purchase the ROU assets at the inception of the lease and account for these options when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or materially restrictive covenants. We have signed a material lease agreement related to the Company's future innovation center in Germany. The lease has not yet commenced as the facility has yet to be constructed and the Company does not have the right to use the property until the future handover date. We do not have any material lease transactions with related parties.Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in operating expense on our consolidated statements of income. Operating lease cost was $24.3 million, $22.3 million and $22.0 million in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Credit Agreement is a five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, which we use to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans of up to $700.0 million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be (1) Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for any borrowings in euros, pounds sterling, yen, and U.S. dollars, respectively, plus an applicable margin, (2) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus an applicable margin, or (3) fixed as negotiated by us. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2027.The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including one financial covenant: a maximum leverage ratio where debt, net of domestic cash in excess of $25 million and sixty percent of the unrestricted cash held outside of the United States, must be less than or equal to 3.75 times trailing twelve months EBITDA, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses.As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement and we had no borrowings outstanding and $700.0 million of availability. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 5.5 percent for the year ended June 30, 2025.48Borrowings on other lines of credit and notes payable were $1.0 million and $1.4 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The lines of credit represented short-term borrowings under credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate. The availability of these credit lines, translated into U.S. dollars at June 30, 2025 exchange rates, totaled $62.1 million.NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXESIncome (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended June 30: (in thousands)202520242023Income (loss) before income taxes:United States$(10,085)$(13,544)$(14,702)International142,089 157,994 174,323 Total income before income taxes$132,004 $144,450 $159,621 Current income tax expense (benefit):Federal$2,048 $(4,003)$2,007 State346 1,045 546 International43,986 41,784 42,921 Total current income tax expense46,380 38,826 45,474 Deferred income tax expense (benefit): Federal$(7,647)$(3,389)$(3,394)State(1,549)(2,880)683 International(3,888)(1,748)(6,508)Total deferred income tax expense (benefit):(13,084)(8,017)(9,219)Provision for income taxes$33,296 $30,809 $36,255 Effective tax rate25.2 %21.3 %22.7 %Swiss tax reform. Legislation was effectively enacted during the December quarter of fiscal 2021 when the Canton of Schaffhausen approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing on October 8, 2019 (Swiss tax reform). Significant changes from Swiss tax reform include the abolishment of certain favorable tax regimes and the creation of a multi-year transitional period at both the federal and cantonal levels. The transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform allow companies to utilize a combination of lower tax rates and tax basis adjustments to fair value, which are used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in deductions over the transitional period. To reflect the federal and cantonal transitional provisions, as they apply to us, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $14.5 million during the December quarter of fiscal 2021. We considered the deferred tax asset from Swiss tax reform to be an estimate based on our current interpretation of the legislation, which was subject to change based on further legislative guidance, review with the Swiss federal and cantonal authorities, and modifications to the underlying valuation. During the December quarter of our fiscal 2024, we adjusted the calculation of the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform after a review and receipt of a ruling from the Swiss federal and cantonal authorities and recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit to adjust the deferred tax asset and income tax liabilities related to fiscal years 2022 and 2023.49Table of ContentsThe reconciliation of income taxes computed using the statutory U.S. income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was as follows for the years ended June 30:(in thousands)202520242023Income taxes at U.S. statutory rate$27,721 $30,335 $33,520 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit(950)(1,412)971 U.S. income taxes provided on international income3,220 4,272 4,583 Combined tax effects of international income8,165 10,355 5,761 Change in valuation allowance and other uncertain tax positions(103)(3,590)(4,060)U.S. research and development credit(2,880)(4,026)(3,325)Advanced manufacturing production credit(2,941)(488)— Combined effects of Swiss tax reform— (7,801)(2,225)Non-deductible executive compensation417 2,389 667 Other647 775 363 Provision for income taxes$33,296 $30,809 $36,255 During 2024, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.8 million to record the effects of a tax rate increase enacted by the cantonal and municipal tax authorities where we operate in Switzerland.

Of that amount, $0.3 million expires through 2035, $17.6 million expires through 2045, and $1.7 million does not expire.Included in deferred tax assets at June 30, 2025 is $19.8 million associated with NOL carryforwards in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Of that amount, $2.4 million expires through 2030, $1.0 million expires through 2035, $0.8 million expires through 2040, $2.9 million expires through 2045, and the remaining $12.7 million does not expire. The realization of these tax benefits is primarily dependent on future taxable income in these jurisdictions.A valuation allowance of $6.2 million has been placed against deferred tax assets primarily in U.S. state, Hong Kong and Vietnam jurisdictions, all of which would be allocated to income tax expense upon realization of the deferred tax assets. As the respective operations generate sufficient income, the valuation allowances will be partially or fully reversed at such time we believe it will be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In 2025, the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets increased by $0.3 million.We consider the majority of the $1.0 billion unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. With regard to these unremitted earnings, we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws. With regard to the small portion of unremitted earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested, we maintain a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes. The deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries not permanently reinvested is $3.8 million as of June 30, 2025.In 2012, we received an assessment from the Italian tax authority that denied certain tax deductions primarily related to our 2008 tax return. Attempts at negotiating a reasonable settlement with the tax authority were unsuccessful; and as a result, we decided to litigate the matter which was eventually settled during 2024. We continue to believe the assessment was baseless and that our 2008 tax return was compliant, in all material respects, with Italian income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, no income tax liability had been recorded in connection with this assessment in any period. During fiscal 2024, the Italian government launched a tax amnesty program aimed at reducing the number of tax disputes pending before the Italian courts. Pursuant to program guidelines, payments made to successfully resolve a dispute had to be received by the Italian government no later than September 30, 2023. Due to the prolonged amount of time the case had been pending, and the inherent costs and risks of further litigating the matter, we decided to negotiate a settlement with the Italian tax authority that resulted in an income tax charge of $2.9 million during fiscal 2024. With this settlement, the matter is officially closed. 51Table of ContentsA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalty) is as follows as of June 30:(in thousands)202520242023Balance at beginning of year$1,309 $6,935 $7,598 (Decreases)/Increases for tax positions of prior years316— (658)Increases for tax positions related to the current year7779— Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations(140)(5,686)(99)Foreign currency translation132(19)94Balance at end of year$1,694 $1,309 $6,935 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in 2025, 2024 and 2023 is $1.7 million, $1.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $0.1 million within the next twelve months.Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. We recognized an increase of $0.1 million in 2025 and a decrease of $0.9 million and $0.3 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the amount of interest accrued was $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the amount of penalty accrued was $0.1 million.With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2019. The Internal Revenue Service has audited, or the statute of limitations has expired, for all U.S. tax years prior to 2022. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining our income tax returns for various tax years ranging from 2019 to 2024. We continuously review our uncertain tax positions and evaluate any potential issues that may lead to an increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. NOTE 14 — PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSDefined Benefit Pension Plans. We have defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the U.S., Germany, the UK, Switzerland, India and Israel. Pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and, for certain plans, on average compensation for specified years preceding retirement. We fund pension costs in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, for U.S. plans and in accordance with local regulations or customs for non-U.S. plans. The accrued benefit for all participants in the Kennametal Inc. Retirement Income Plan was frozen as of December 31, 2016. The majority of our defined benefit pension plans are closed to future participation. We have an Executive Retirement Plan for certain executives and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan both of which are closed to future participation as of June 15, 2017 and July 26, 2006, respectively.We presently provide varying levels of postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain employees and retirees. By fiscal 2019, participants over the age of 65 were transitioned to a private exchange and some received a fixed Health Retirement Account (HRA) contribution to offset the cost of their coverage. Postretirement health and life benefits are closed to future participants as of December 31, 2016. We use a June 30 measurement date for all of our plans. During 2025, the Company completed the wind-up of its Canadian defined benefit pension plans and recorded a settlement charge of $0.8 million. During 2023 and 2025, the Company annuitized portions of its UK defined benefit pension plans through the purchase of full buy-in policies. The Company expects to progress to a buy-out and an eventual wind-up of the UK plans after completing customary procedures including obtaining relevant regulatory approvals. The wind-up of the UK plans is expected to occur in fiscal 2026 and 2027.52Table of ContentsThe funded status of our pension plans and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30 were as follows:(in thousands)20252024Change in benefit obligation:Benefit obligation, beginning of year$677,054 $695,911 Service cost909 1,181 Interest cost34,013 35,551 Participant contributions438 434 Actuarial gains(1,772)(4,575)Benefits and expenses paid(54,192)(54,130)Currency translation adjustments14,887 (2,031)Plan amendments12 (51)Plan settlements(3,480)(668)Plan curtailments— — Other adjustments1,161 5,432 Benefit obligation, end of year$669,030 $677,054 Change in plans' assets:Fair value of plans' assets, beginning of year$636,088 $650,180 Actual return on plans' assets35,556 26,205 Company contributions7,755 10,104 Participant contributions438 434 Plan settlements(3,480)(668)Benefits and expenses paid(54,192)(54,130)Currency translation adjustments7,330 (372)Other adjustments93 4,335 Fair value of plans' assets, end of year$629,588 $636,088 Funded status of plans$(39,442)$(40,966)Amounts recognized in the balance sheets consist of:Long-term prepaid benefit$75,062 $70,016 Short-term accrued benefit obligation(7,541)(7,401)Accrued pension benefits(106,963)(103,581)Net amount recognized$(39,442)$(40,966)The pre-tax amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows at June 30:(in thousands)20252024Unrecognized net actuarial losses$292,946 $291,650 Unrecognized net prior service costs1,762 1,728 Unrecognized transition obligations— — Total$294,708 $293,378 To the best of our knowledge and belief, the asset portfolios of our defined benefit pension plans do not contain our capital stock.

Assumptions.

The assumptions were as follows for 2023: 2023Health care costs trend rate assumed for next year7.0 %Rate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines5.0 %Year that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain2031Plan Assets. The primary objective of certain of our pension plans' investment policies is to ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide the benefit obligations at the time the obligations come due. The overall investment strategy for the defined benefit pension plans' assets combines considerations of preservation of principal and moderate risk-taking. The assumption of an acceptable level of risk is warranted in order to achieve satisfactory results consistent with the long-term objectives of the portfolio. Fixed income securities comprise a significant portion of the portfolio due to their plan-liability-matching characteristics and to address the plans' cash flow requirements. Additionally, diversification of investments within each asset class is utilized to further reduce the effect of losses in single investments.Investment management practices for U.S. defined benefit pension plans must comply with ERISA and all applicable regulations and rulings thereof. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. Currently, the use of derivative instruments is not significant when compared to the overall investment portfolio.The Company utilizes a liability driven investment strategy (LDI) for the assets of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in order to reduce the volatility of the funded status of these plans and to meet the obligations at an acceptable cost over the long term. This LDI strategy entails modifying the asset allocation and duration of the assets of the plans to more closely match the liability profile of these plans. The asset reallocation involves increasing the fixed income allocation, reducing the equity component and adding alternative investments. Longer duration interest rate swaps have been utilized periodically in order to increase the overall duration of the asset portfolio to more closely match the liabilities.Our defined benefit pension plans’ asset allocations as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 and target allocations for 2026, by asset class, were as follows:20252024Target %Equity13 %13 %13 %Fixed Income72 83 71 Other15 4 16 The following sections describe the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note 5 for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).Corporate fixed income securities.

Total restructuring and related charges for this program of $22.0 million, compared to a target of approximately $25 million, were recorded through June 30, 2025, consisting of $16.6 million in Metal Cutting and $5.5 million in Infrastructure. This action was considered substantially complete as of December 31, 2024.In January 2025, we announced several actions to support the long-term competitiveness of the Company and to mitigate softer market conditions. Total restructuring and related charges for this program of $11.4 million, compared to a target of approximately $25 million, were recorded through June 30, 2025, consisting of $8.8 million in Metal Cutting and $2.6 million in Infrastructure. The Company substantially completed the closure of a facility in Greenfield, MA and the consolidation of facilities in Barcelona, Spain during 2025 as a part of these actions.During 2025, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $13.3 million, which consisted of $10.4 million in Metal Cutting and $2.8 million in Infrastructure. Of this amount, restructuring-related charges of $1.3 million were included in cost of goods sold and $0.2 million were included in operating expense.During 2024, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $12.4 million, which consisted of $8.5 million in Metal Cutting and $3.9 million in Infrastructure. These amounts are inclusive of a reversal of restructuring and related charges of $1.1 million related to prior actions, including $0.4 million in operating expense. Also included in restructuring and other charges, net during 2024 is a net benefit of $0.6 million primarily due to the sale of properties.During 2023, we recorded restructuring and related charges of $6.6 million, which consisted of $5.3 million in Metal Cutting and $1.3 million in Infrastructure. These amounts are inclusive of a reversal of restructuring and related charges of $0.8 million related to prior actions.

The carrying amounts approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.Long-Term Debt, Including Current Maturities. Fixed rate debt had a fair market value of $570.8 million and $545.9 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Level 2 fair value is determined based on the quoted market prices for similar debt instruments as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.Concentrations of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments and trade receivables. By policy, we make temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions and limit the amount of exposure to any one financial institution. With respect to trade receivables, concentrations of credit risk are significantly reduced because we serve numerous customers in many industries and geographic areas.We are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivatives and, in the unlikely event of nonperformance, to market risk for changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as settlement risk. We manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had no significant concentrations of credit risk.NOTE 18 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONStock Options.

Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions were less than the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes by $0.8 million, $1.5 million and $0.8 million in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.61Table of ContentsThe amount of cash received from the exercise of capital stock options during 2025, 2024 and 2023 was zero. The related tax benefit was zero in 2025, 2024 and 2023. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2025, 2024 and 2023 was zero.Restricted Stock Units – Time Vesting and Performance Vesting. Performance vesting restricted stock units are earned based on both annual and three-year performance targets. The performance vesting restricted stock units are subject to a service condition that requires the individual to be employed by the Company at the payment date after a three-year period, with the exception of retirement eligible grantees. Time vesting stock units are valued at the market value of the stock on the grant date. Performance vesting stock units with a market condition are valued using a Monte Carlo model.Changes in our performance vesting and time vesting restricted stock units for 2025 were as follows:PerformanceVestingStockUnitsPerformanceVestingWeightedAverage FairValueTime VestingStock UnitsTime VestingWeightedAverage FairValueUnvested, June 30, 2024552,461 $28.73 1,122,569 $27.36 Granted303,546 25.15 761,097 25.05 Vested(112,598)36.72 (549,752)28.64 Performance metric adjustments, net(107,780)32.98 — — Forfeited(67,297)25.94 (136,699)25.56 Unvested, June 30, 2025568,332 $24.76 1,197,215 $25.50 During 2025, 2024 and 2023, compensation expense related to performance vesting and time vesting restricted stock units was $21.0 million, $23.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively.

As of June 30, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance vesting and time vesting restricted stock units was $21.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.NOTE 19— ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSThe operation of our business has exposed us to certain liabilities and compliance costs related to environmental matters. We are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain sites associated with our current or former operations.We establish and maintain accruals for estimated liabilities associated with certain environmental matters. At June 30, 2025, the balance of such accruals was $11.0 million, of which $1.4 million was current. At June 30, 2024, the balance was $11.0 million, of which $1.6 million was current. These accruals are generally not discounted.We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular environmental matter is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. When a material loss contingency is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a material loss contingency is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. The accruals we have established for estimated environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs of addressing identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), other governmental agencies and by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) groups in which we are participating. The accrued liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the government or the courts on these matters.Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), under which we have been identified by the USEPA or other third party as a PRP with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and estimated liability associated with these sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals are adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at the sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.62NOTE 20 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLegal Matters. Various lawsuits arising during the normal course of business are pending against us. In our opinion, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these matters will have no significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. During 2023, we recorded a litigation settlement of $3 million related to legacy operations within other (income) expense, net. In February 2025, MachiningCloud, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California alleging breach of a contract and other matters and is seeking more than $330 million in damages. The Company removed the case to federal court in the Western District of California Western Division. At this early stage of the litigation, no determination can be made with regard to the outcome of the litigation, including the probability of an unfavorable outcome. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action, including without limitation, bringing counterclaims against MachiningCloud, Inc.Lease Commitments. We lease a wide variety of facilities, primarily for warehousing, production and offices, as well as vehicles and equipment that are considered operating leases. Refer to Note 9 for more information.Purchase Commitments. We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies and machinery and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. Some of these commitments extend beyond one year and are based on minimum purchase requirements. We believe these commitments are not at prices in excess of current market.Other Contractual Obligations. We do not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our liquidity.Related Party Transactions. Sales to affiliated companies were immaterial in 2025, 2024 and 2023. We do not have any other related party transactions that affect our operations, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.NOTE 21 — SEGMENT DATAThe Company manages and reports its business in the following two segments: Metal Cutting and Infrastructure. The Company's reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. The Company's chief operating decision maker is its President and Chief Executive Officer. The President and Chief Executive Officer regularly reviews the discrete financial information of the Metal Cutting and Infrastructure reportable operating segments to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. The primary measure of profit or loss considered by the President and Chief Executive Officer when evaluating reportable operating segment performance is segment operating income. We do not allocate certain corporate expenses related to executive retirement plans, the Company’s Board of Directors and strategic initiatives, as well as certain other costs and report them in Corporate. Our reportable operating segments do not represent the aggregation of two or more operating segments. Sales to a single customer did not aggregate to more than five percent of total sales in 2025, 2024 and 2023.
