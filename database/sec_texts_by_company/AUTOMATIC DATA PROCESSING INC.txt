Our clients look to us as a source of expertise to understand key HR trends and best practices, employment and related legislation and regulations, and to offer thoughtful strategies to utilize HCM technology to achieve their business objectives and support their workforce. Many of our clients also ask us to take on responsibility for a portion or all of their HCM workflows via one of our Human Resources Outsourcing (“HRO”) solutions. We continue to build on our deep expertise and make it readily available to our clients through a variety of channels, ranging from traditional call and chat options to self-guided and AI-powered options. We will continue to leverage our significant data insights and investments in AI and other technologies to further enable and effectively apply our decades of knowledge and experience to help our clients and their workers navigate the ever-changing world of work.• Benefit our Clients with Our Global Scale. Our clients benefit from our unmatched global footprint and scale in the HCM industry. We will continue to build on these strengths to further improve our client experience, and to add to our global footprint to further meet our clients where they choose to do business and address their needs for a distributed and flexible workforce. We see meaningful opportunities to leverage our strength in global payroll and expand our HR and workforce management 4solutions to support our global and multinational clients. We continue to build more relationships with partners, such as through the ADP Marketplace, in order to provide clients with seamless integrations and customizations that simplify their HR processes and best address their unique needs. And we intend to grow our sales organization and continue to invest in best-in-class sales technology to not only optimize the purchase experience but to also empower our sellers to provide the deep expertise and insights our clients require to ensure they have the right HCM solutions to help them achieve their objectives and make a meaningful impact for their employees. Innovation at ADPInnovation is in our DNA. For over 75 years, we have proven that actively listening and responding to what clients and their employees need and want keeps the world of work progressing forward. As a founder in the industry, we pioneered HCM automation, HCM in the cloud, mobile HCM and a digital HCM marketplace, laying the groundwork and streamlining our infrastructure to innovate at a faster pace. This spirit of innovation remains a steady guide as we continue to listen and respond to emerging needs. As technologies like AI, machine learning (“ML”) and generative AI change how work happens, we remain focused on providing our clients and associates with HCM technology that is easy to use, powered with smart insights and personalized to support a human-centric experience. To bring these solutions to market, we pursue multiple paths to innovation. From leveraging our unique data to provide differentiated insights to collaborating with, or investing in, organizations with complementary products to purchasing solutions that add to our strong foundation, each of these paths helps ADP sustain a culture focused on continuous innovation.Strategically infusing AIThe AI landscape is evolving quickly. As we move from early automation and predictive analytics to AI-enabled workflows, agentic AI is the future of innovation in the HCM space. Our AI strategy is to deliver AI agents for all major HCM roles that our clients have. Our clients have employees performing different roles such as payroll, HR, benefits, compensation, and recruiting. Our goal is to deliver AI agents that continue to automate tedious, time heavy tasks and deliver value to these individuals to do more strategic activities. Similarly, we intend to deliver AI role-based agents to our internal associates such as sales, software engineering, testing, product management, service, and implementation.To advance these efforts, we continue to roll out ADP Assist, our award-winning cross-platform solution powered by generative AI that transforms data into credible and actionable insights. ADP Assist offers smart, user-centric solutions through a conversational interface that touches every aspect of HR – payroll, time, talent, benefits, recruitment, analytics, reporting, and compliance.ADP Assist validates payroll information, checking for payroll anomalies and using generative AI to identify and help resolve missing tax registrations and answer questions by drawing on ADP’s large, up-to-date dataset of compliance information. ADP Assist also uses generative AI to simplify report creation, helping HR practitioners and leaders access internal, national, and global workforce data to analyze compensation, turnover, candidate profile relevancy, and talent market insights. A 2024 AI Breakthrough Award winner, the solution was also recognized in Business Intelligence Group’s 2025 BIG Innovation Awards and 2025 Artificial Intelligence Excellence Awards for driving innovation and possibilities in AI. Along with transforming our solutions, we firmly believe AI and generative AI enhance our operations and enable us to elevate the end-to-end client experience. To lean into our service expertise, we continue to extend generative AI capabilities to a broader portion of our service and implementation associates to deliver an even better client experience. We also continue to explore generative AI capabilities to further empower our sellers to be more productive. In addition, we extended AI tools to all of our product developers for coding, testing, and documentation. Data is our differentiatorTo harness the power of AI, data is critical – and it’s the foundation of the advantage we bring to our clients. Data is at the core of our products and solutions, informing and driving our approach to innovation and new technology. The global scale and scope of our client base provide us the industry’s largest and deepest HCM dataset with over 1.1 million clients spanning over 140 countries and territories and 42 million workers globally. Our broad and granular data set positions us well to deliver smarter and more tailored HCM agents that we believe will be truly differentiated in the market. Additionally, combining our vast client and service data with client outcomes gives us a deeper understanding of clients’ needs and goals. AI represents the next frontier, and our industry-leading data set married to our best-in-class distribution offers 5ADP a distinct, competitive advantage. AI and ML drive many of the key features of ADP’s data products, including ADP DataCloud, our award-winning people analytics solution. ADP DataCloud analyzes aggregated, anonymized and timely HCM and compensation data from more than one million organizations across the U.S., powering solutions that provide clients with in-depth workforce and business insights that enable critical HR decisions. Analytics enhanced by ADP Assist leverages generative AI to deliver answers to analytics questions across key practice areas including benefits, HR, payroll, recruitment and time, helping to remove user friction. Scalable, Global HCM OfferingsWe also continue to advance our next-gen platforms, launching ADP Lyric HCM in September 2024. Building on our position as a leader in global pay, we designed Lyric to be as dynamic as the world of work. The unified, global HCM solution is designed for adaptability, providing our clients with the flexibility they need to address today’s and tomorrow’s workplace challenges, and to personalize the experience based on their needs. The solution was named “Data Solution of the Year for Human Resources” in the 2025 Data Breakthrough Awards.To expand our global offering and enhance our enterprise solution suite, in October 2024 ADP acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider that specializes in supporting large, global enterprises. WorkForce Software’s solutions can adapt to the dynamic needs of today’s employers, creating resiliency, driving performance and making managing a global workforce easy. This acquisition expands our current array of global time and attendance, absence management and scheduling tools and will drive workforce management innovation to help meet the future needs of businesses. In addition, ADP acquired Procesamiento Externo de Información, S.C. (PEI) in February 2025, a provider of
local payroll, HCM expertise, and technology solutions for Mexican businesses, strengthening ADP’s capabilities in local and global payroll and HR.Sustaining a culture of responsible AIIn harnessing the power of data through AI and ML, ADP recognizes the importance of accountability, transparency, privacy, explainability and governance, and in furtherance of those goals has established an active AI & Data Ethics Committee, comprised of both industry leaders and ADP experts, which advises on emerging industry trends and concerns and provides guidance with respect to compliance with the principles that ADP should follow while developing products, systems and applications that involve AI, ML and data.As we continue to explore the potential that new technologies like generative AI can provide, we understand the great responsibility we have to approach these innovations in a way that is ethical, secure, and compliant for our business and the clients and workers we serve around the world. This led to our establishment of an interdisciplinary working group across ADP to determine governance for use cases and adoption of a set of principles and processes to govern the use of these newer technologies, including operational monitoring of recommendations made by AI and ML technologies.Creating a customized HR ecosystemTo meet clients’ shifting needs, we also collaborate with partners through solutions like ADP Marketplace, one of the largest e-commerce platforms for HR solutions in the industry. This innovative marketplace empowers our clients to connect and share data seamlessly across their HR systems, offering access to over 800 partner solutions - from recruiting and onboarding to compliance and learning management. With the introduction of AI technology, including our generative AI smart search tool, clients can quickly discover and evaluate partner solutions using natural language, enabling clients to tailor their HCM ecosystem with integrated solutions that best fit their unique needs. Additionally, ADP API Central offers secure APIs and tools and resources for custom integrations to simplify and automate business processes. This solution was named 6“New Product of the Year” in Business Intelligence Group’s 2024 BIG Awards for Business.Accelerating innovationReflecting our commitment to innovation, ADP’s corporate venture capital arm and innovation lab, ADP Ventures, is focused on enhancing and strengthening ADP’s core business, creating offerings in new adjacent segments and geographies, and developing new assets to monetize markets and segments beyond HCM.
As part of its strategy, ADP Ventures invests in and partners with early-stage and scaling tech startups that advance ADP’s innovation strategy. Reportable SegmentsOur two reportable business segments are Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”), and are based on the way that management reviews the performance of, and makes decisions about, our businesses. For financial data by segment and by geographic area, see Note 15 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Employer Services.

ADP TotalSource clients are able to offer their employees services and benefits on par with those of much larger enterprises, without the need to staff a full HR department.

The most material markets for HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) are the United States, Canada and Europe. In each market, we have both country-specific solutions and multi-country solutions, for employers of all sizes and complexities. The major components of our offerings throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and workforce management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and/or remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Our PEO business offers services exclusively in the United States.We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We also market HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with certified public accountants and banks, among others. None of our major business units has a single homogeneous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client, industry or industry group is material to our overall revenues. We are a leader in each of our major service offerings and do not believe any of our major services or business units is subject to unique market risk.COMPETITIONThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We know of no reliable statistics by which we can determine the number of our competitors, but we believe that we are one of the largest providers of HCM solutions in the world. HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) compete with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions. Our PEO business competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions. We also face ongoing competition from companies’ in-house functions, whereby companies install and operate their own HCM system.Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of offerings, and price. We believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leading-edge technology (together with our data) and commitment to service excellence, distinguishes us from our competitors.INDUSTRY REGULATIONOur business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.11As a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection, AI and cybersecurity-related laws, including federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data. The changing nature of these comprehensive laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the European Union’s (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”),
the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), and the Department of Justice’s (the “DOJ”) Data Security Program established under Executive Order 14117, impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. The GDPR imposes strict and comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor. As part of our overall data protection compliance program, including with respect to data protection laws in the EU, we are one of the few companies in the world to have implemented Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”). Compliance with our BCRs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the GDPR and other data protection laws in the EU. The CPRA requires companies to provide data disclosure, access, deletion and opt-out rights to consumers in California. The DOJ’s Data Security Program requires us to ensure that there is not access to sensitive personal data of U.S. persons by countries of concern in excess of certain thresholds. In the area of AI, some states and localities in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere have proposed or already enacted legislation that imposes obligations on how we develop and market AI-based products and solutions. Specifically, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act imposes requirements on providers of certain types of AI services. Additionally, self-regulatory frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework are being promulgated and adherence to these may become an industry standard or client expectation. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and ADP TotalSource.As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to our clients’ employees, tax authorities and other payees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck. In 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (the “OCC”) authorized us to open ADP Trust Company, National Association (the “ADP Trust Bank”), via a national trust bank charter pursuant to the National Bank Act. The ADP Trust Bank is the sole trustee of ADP Client Trust, our grantor trust which holds U.S. client funds, and is responsible for the oversight and management of those client funds. The ADP Trust Bank, and all of its fiduciary activities including the U.S. money movement it oversees and manages via ADP Client Trust, is subject to comprehensive ongoing oversight and regulation by the OCC. In addition, our U.S. money movement managed by the ADP Trust Bank and our U.S. prepaid access offering are subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “BSA”). Our prepaid access offerings are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Consumer protections for prepaid accounts under Regulation E include requirements related to pre-acquisition fee and other disclosures, error resolution and investigation, and account access. Elements of our money movement activities outside of the United States are subject to licensing and similar anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in certain countries in which we provide such services. In February 2024, ADP Canada Co. became a registered entity with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (“FINTRAC”), Canada’s anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing supervisor, as a Money Service Business as a result of a change in policy guidance from FINTRAC related to the Canadian Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. In November 2024, ADP Canada Co. filed its application for registration with the Bank of Canada as a Payment Services Provider, as defined and required under the Retail Payment Activities Act.Our employee background screening services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements and, as a Certified PEO, maintains certifications with the Internal Revenue Service. Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees, we may be subject to certain obligations, responsibilities and liabilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws, including worksite employee payroll obligations and with respect to claimed employee retention and other tax credits. ADP Strategic Plan Services, LLC, our registered investment adviser, provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Labor. ADP Broker-Dealer, Inc., which supports our Retirement Services business, is a registered broker-dealer regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. ADP Retirement Trust Services, LLC supports our Retirement Services business as a New Hampshire state-chartered trust company. ADP Retirement Trust Services, LLC is a directed-fiduciary trustee with responsibility for oversight of the retirement plan assets of our clients and regulated by the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is also subject to the oversight of the New Hampshire Banking Department.Our current and future offerings in the payments and/or consumer space may also subject us to additional laws and regulations, which could also require corresponding compliance programs and policies and dedicated resources.12In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services. For example, our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages. In addition, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States realize tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities, is based on federal, state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits, which are subject to renewal, amendment or rescission.We believe that key components of our compliance programs provide real competitive differentiators. For instance, our BCRs have enabled ADP to apply a global standard of data protection, simplifying data transfer processes and assisting our clients in meeting the demanding standards of data protection expected in Europe – a solution that most competitors cannot provide. Similarly, the ADP Client Trust and ADP Trust Bank provide client funds with a level of protection that most competitors cannot offer. The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTSWe provide services to more than 1.1 million clients. In fiscal 2025, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of our annual consolidated revenues.We are continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to nine months). In some cases, based on a client's timeline, the period may exceed two years for a large, multi-country ADP Global Payroll or ADP Lyric HCM client or other large, multi-phase implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business. This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients. In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer-term contracts with initial terms typically ranging from two to seven years. However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of our expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to management's estimate of our future revenue.Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to us. Based on our retention levels in fiscal 2025, our client retention is estimated at approximately 13 years in Employer Services, and approximately 6 years in PEO.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTWe continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our solutions and services. In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on our revenues. We believe that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we invested approximately $1.388 billion, $1.276 billion, and $1.195 billion, respectively, in research and development. These investments include expenses for activities such as the development of new products, maintenance expenses associated with our existing technologies, investments in generative AI, purchases of 13new software and software licenses, and additions to software resulting from business combinations.LICENSESWe are the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. Our business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to our business as a whole.OUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE Our HCM strategy is simple: our people have differentiated us for over 75 years and we remain committed to valuing, developing and engaging them. Our Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”), together with our Executive Leadership Team, manages our HCM strategy and related programs and initiatives, as well as our talent strategy. Our CHRO, along with our CEO, as appropriate, regularly updates and supports our Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board (“CMDC”) as well as the Board of Directors on HCM matters. The CMDC is responsible for these matters, as well as our executive compensation program, company-wide equity-based plans, and our management succession planning and development program. Our Associates As of June 30, 2025, our global team of associates consisted of approximately 67,000 persons. Our Culture and ValuesOver seventy-five years ago, our founders established values that still guide us today. We seek to create a values-based culture where every associate feels like they belong and can thrive. Our long-term business success is closely linked to our commitment to creating an environment in which our associates can achieve their full potential, and to do so we listen to and engage our associates. We conduct an annual culture survey, myVoice, where our associates can share their perspectives on important topics, including client service, culture, social responsibility, ethics and compliance, innovation and leadership. Along with many of our world-class clients, we leverage our innovative StandOut® powered by ADP platform, to help managers drive talent engagement throughout the year. We issue quarterly global StandOut® Engagement Pulse® surveys to ensure that all associates can share with their leaders how they feel about their work and their colleagues, and for us to get a snapshot of engagement across the globe.
Through our myMoment Recognition Program, we give our associates the opportunity to recognize and celebrate each other when they demonstrate our values, drive our goals and go above and beyond in contributing to our collective success. Our global ADP Cares program, which is funded by the ADP Foundation and our generous associates, helps members of our team get through difficult, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and major illnesses. We also proudly support our associates that give back to our communities through paid volunteer time off and our donation matching program.We value different perspectives and believe that our associates and their best ideas thrive in a diverse and inclusive environment.We have a number of initiatives to strengthen and further cultivate our values-based culture. As an example, ADP’s Global IDEB Impact Council was created to align and amplify our inclusion efforts, providing us with an advantage to attract and retain associates and clients. The council, comprised of senior leaders across the enterprise, was designed to focus across four pillars, including Technology & Innovation, Culture & Belonging, Business Practices and Talent Practices. Our voluntary business resource groups, which cover a broad array of associates and are open to all that share common interests and experiences, make us stronger by promoting inclusion and cultural awareness, accelerating associate engagement, retention and career development, helping build relationships in our communities, and promoting the conservation and restoration of natural resources.
At ADP, we are committed to upholding fair and equitable pay. Pay equity is critical to creating a culture that enables all associates to reach their full potential. We make pay decisions based on skills, job-related experience, the market value of the job and performance. We have incorporated regular pay equity reviews into our compensation decisions. And, we do not ask candidates to provide their salary history in most of the countries where we operate.14Our commitment to building a better world of work and creating a workplace where everyone can thrive has led to recognition across the globe, including Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies (19 consecutive years); Forbes’ America’s Best Large Employers; Fortune’s America’s Most Innovative Companies; Fast Company’s Best Workplaces for Innovators; TIME’s World’s Best Companies; and Newsweek’s Most Trustworthy Companies in America.Our Talent StrategyOur talent strategy is simple – we aim to attract, develop and retain ambitious, passionate and overall top talent by offering a place where our associates can grow their careers, challenge themselves, share generously, take risks, and create positive change. This has allowed us to be recognized by esteemed organizations as an employer of choice year after year. We invest in our team members so that they have the skills necessary to succeed and grow their careers. The ADP talent journey begins with an innovative, engaging and comprehensive onboarding process followed by extensive training and mentorship. Thereafter, our associates can access a wide range of professional and functional skills training to further continue and enhance performance and career development. Our sales professionals are provided with award-winning training programs and tools throughout their careers, and we also provide our technologists with access to training and experiences in the latest technologies on the market. We know our people leaders have tremendous impact on our associates and clients, and so we invest in a leadership development strategy that uses innovative approaches to support new and experienced leaders with formal learning, tools to understand and engage their team, and in the moment support during moments that matter. Additionally, our succession planning process deploys leaders to new career experiences that help ensure we are developing executives that will deliver results now and in the future.Our Benefits and Health and Wellness ProgramsThe wide range of benefits and health and wellness programs we offer contribute to an environment where all our associates add to our success. Our associates receive a competitive benefits package, intended to help them enjoy physical, emotional and financial well-being and be productive members of their teams. While exact benefits vary by associate and region, they typically include health care coverage, a 401(k) plan with company matching contributions for U.S. associates, life insurance, paid time off and tuition reimbursement. We particularly emphasize benefits that support individual and family needs (parental leave, adoption/fertility benefits and caregiver support), and constantly update our programs according to our associates’ needs.We offer physical and mental wellness programs that help our team pursue a healthy lifestyle and reduce absenteeism and lost time due to injuries. Our efforts include a company-wide health and safety manual and website, safety education and training, and a wellness program that rewards associates for completing wellness activities. Physical and mental health initiatives vary across regions, but can include personal health checks, nutrition and fitness expert visits offering free consultation and programs, employee mental wellness assistance programs, free counseling and mental health therapy assistance for associates, and mindfulness classes.

Risk FactorsOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. The risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. You should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See "Item 1. Business—Competition" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. The risks described below are not the only risks we face and the occurrence of any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSFailure to comply with, compliance with or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequencesOur business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the “Industry Regulation” section in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could cause us to incur substantial costs or could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, and lawsuits, including class actions, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.In addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby, adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable tax authorities. Changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations or rulings or the interpretation thereof could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. In addition, changes in federal, state or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits (including the non-renewal of such laws) could adversely impact our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States realize tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities.
Changes in laws or regulations could also cause us to modify our client funds investment strategy, which may reduce the interest income earned on such funds. Changes in laws, or interpretations thereof, that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our PEO business. In addition, changes in the manner in which health and welfare plans sponsored by PEOs or the TotalSource Health and Welfare Plan, in particular, are regulated could adversely impact the demand for our PEO offering. Because our PEO is a co-employer with our PEO clients and a Certified PEO by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be subject to certain obligations, responsibilities and liabilities of an employer with respect to Worksite Employees (“WSE”), including with respect to their wages and the payment thereof, tax credits for employers, the payment of certain taxes with respect to WSE wages and employee benefits provided to the WSEs. Even though PEO clients are contractually responsible for the timely remittance of such costs, it is possible that our clients will not remit such payments despite their contractual obligations. The risk of failing to receive such payments from PEO clients could be magnified during significant financial or other disruptions or catastrophic events, such as the failure of a bank with whom a significant number of PEO clients may bank at the time, or more widespread stress or failure within the U.S. banking system. Any such event could prevent or materially delay the recovery of any payments not timely remitted and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.In addition, our payroll and tax processing services involve the collection and disbursement of a significant amount of funds to a large number of federal, state and local tax authorities.
Our failure to properly or timely remit taxes on behalf of our clients could result in fines, penalties and interest for which we could be responsible, and could materially adversely affect our reputation, results of operations or financial condition.Our Wisely® offerings and potentially other future offerings in the payments and/or consumer space may subject us to additional laws and regulations, some of which may not be uniform and may require us to modify or restrict our offerings and decrease our potential revenue and earnings. 16Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequencesRegulators worldwide continue to exercise a high level of scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such scrutiny has resulted in aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and regulations, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. We operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties and, in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others. In addition, some of our businesses and entities in the U.S. and a number of other countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “BSA”). Among other things, the BSA requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as national trust banks and providers of prepaid access like us), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. We have registered our prepaid card business as a provider of prepaid access, and registered ADP Trust Bank and ADP Retirement Trust Services with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ADP Canada Co. is a registered entity with FINTRAC as a Money Service Business. In November 2024, ADP Canada Co. filed its application for registration with the Bank of Canada as a Payment Services Provider as defined and required under the Retail Payment Activities Act. We have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we regularly review, upgrade and enhance our policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators. Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Further, bank regulators continue to impose additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their BSA obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses and third-party senders to be higher risk customers for money laundering. As a result, our banking partners that assist in processing our money movement transactions may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional material requirements on us. These regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks’ internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to materially change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.Failure to comply with privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequencesThe collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cyber security laws. These laws, which are not uniform, generally do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, storage, hosting, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, clients, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. The European Union (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and state consumer privacy laws like the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), are among the most comprehensive of these laws, and more and more jurisdictions are adopting similarly comprehensive laws that impose new data privacy protection requirements and restrictions. As part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the GDPR, we implemented Binding 17Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) as both a data processor and data controller, which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with EU data protection laws.
In addition, the Department of Justice implemented a Data Security Program under Executive Order 14117 restricting certain transfers of U.S. persons’ sensitive data to “countries of concern” and we have taken
appropriate steps to comply. We believe that providing insights and content from data, including via AI and ML, will become increasingly important to the value that our solutions and services deliver to our clients. We are increasingly leveraging AI and ML in our solutions and service delivery and are exploring how best to integrate generative AI technologies and develop and deploy capabilities that are beneficial to our clients and their employees. However, legislation that governs the development and/or use of AI has been adopted or is under consideration in the U.S. at the state and local level, as well as abroad, most notably the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act. In addition, self-regulatory frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework are being promulgated and adherence to these may become an industry standard or a client expectation. As a result, the ability to provide data-driven insights and otherwise leverage AI and ML may be constrained by current or future laws (including product liability regimes), regulatory or self-regulatory requirements or ethical considerations, including our own published, guiding ethical principles regarding AI and ML, that could restrict or impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to leverage data and/or these technologies in innovative ways. Our use of generative AI in our products and operations also introduces additional risks, including risks related to accuracy, bias, transparency, security, and privacy. For example, if the data used to train a model or the model’s output is inaccurate or biased, or alleged to be inaccurate or biased, we could be subject to reputational damage or litigation.Complying with privacy, data protection, AI and cyber security laws and requirements, including the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR, our BCRs, U.S. state privacy laws, including the CPRA, and the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation. In addition, data security events, concerns about privacy abuses by other companies and increased awareness of the potential (positive and negative) of AI are changing client, consumer and social expectations for enhanced protections (including with respect to bias and potential discrimination). As a result, noncompliance, the failure to meet such expectations or the perception of noncompliance or such failure, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation.If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could materially adversely affect our business and our brandOur ability to compete and our success depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, clients, vendors, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. We may need to devote significant resources, including cybersecurity resources, to monitoring our intellectual property rights. In addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective, or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Our intellectual property (including source code) could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber-attack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel, or as a result of increased use of generative AI tools by us or our vendors. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which may be successful. In addition, use of AI tools may result in the release of confidential or proprietary information which could limit our ability to protect, or prevent us from protecting, our intellectual property rights.We may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operationsThere is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry. Third parties, including our competitors, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. Additionally, as we expand our use of AI, there is uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights of AI algorithms and content generated by AI and we may become subject to similar claims of infringement. We may be found to be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights, even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, obtain licenses, modify applications, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our clients, vendors or partners in 18connection with any such claim or litigation. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming.SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKSOur businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of personal and business information, and collect, hold and transmit client funds, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses or operations, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, cause losses and materially adversely affect our results of operationsIn connection with our business, we collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors, our partners, and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other personal and business information. We also collect significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients and transmit them to their employees, tax authorities and other payees.We are focused on safeguarding and protecting personal and business information and client funds, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes. Nonetheless, the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication (including due to the use of AI), and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. Certain of these unauthorized parties may be state-sponsored and/or supported by significant financial and technological resources. Although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because unauthorized parties (which could include our personnel) may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of, and the client funds that we collect and transmit.We have programs and processes in place designed to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents. However, as a result of the complexity of our operating environment, the period over which hardware and software has been acquired or other reasons, our programs and processes may not be sufficient or adequate or may fail to prevent, detect or respond to a cybersecurity incident or identify and/or remediate a security vulnerability in our operating environment. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated (including due to the use of AI). In addition, new computing technologies, including quantum computing, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we or our authorized third parties use or have used to encrypt and protect data. We may fail to anticipate or detect these techniques and/or incidents for long periods of time and, even when we do so, we may be unable or fail to implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. Our ability to address data or cybersecurity incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies. Hardware, software, applications or services that we develop or procure from authorized third parties, or are required by governmental or law enforcement agencies to install on our systems, may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could (or in respect of third party software, may be designed to) compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. Unauthorized parties have also attempted to gain (and in certain cases have gained), and will continue to attempt to gain, access to our systems and facilities, and those of our authorized third parties, through fraud, trickery, and other methods of deceit, including using stolen identities to obtain employment with us or our authorized third parties as well as phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use end-user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems, our authorized third parties’ systems or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. As these threats continue to evolve and increase (including due to the use of AI), we continue to invest significant resources, and may be required to invest significant additional resources, to modify and enhance our cybersecurity controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. In addition, as we become increasingly interconnected with our authorized third parties, the security risk of our networks and the larger ecosystem in which we operate is heightened. While our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect confidential personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the systems, personnel or physical facilities of, or the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by, our clients or our authorized third parties and, in any event, unauthorized parties have circumvented in the past, and may in the future be able to circumvent, those security measures. Information or system access obtained by unauthorized parties (which could include our personnel) resulting from successful attacks against our clients or our authorized third parties may, in turn, be used to attack and compromise our information technology systems, or result in production downtimes and operational disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, while we perform due diligence prior to acquisitions and take actions to safeguard the businesses that we acquire, these businesses may not have invested as significantly as we do in security and technology and may be more susceptible to 19cybersecurity incidents, which may make us more vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents as well.We have been, and expect we will continue to be, the subject of cybersecurity attacks, including unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, ransomware attack, insider threats, and theft of sensitive information (including our intellectual property). Although none of the cybersecurity incidents that we have identified to date have materially affected us, including our business strategy, operations, results of operations, or financial condition, we continue to face significant known and unknown cybersecurity threats. In the future, a cybersecurity attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, ransomware attack, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by an unauthorized party (which could include our personnel) with respect to our businesses or our authorized third parties’ businesses, or inadvertent acts or inactions by our authorized third parties or personnel, could result in the loss, disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or our intellectual property or the theft of client or ADP funds, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients, result in liability, litigation, regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider. As the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile, the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients. As a result, the breach or perceived breach of our security systems or the security systems of our authorized third parties could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.While ADP maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk.Our systems, applications, solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations or reputationMany of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. We need to properly manage our systems, applications and solutions, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time, in order to ensure they properly support our businesses. From time to time in the past, these systems, applications or solutions have failed to operate properly or become disabled, and they may do so in the future. Any such failure or disablement, even for a brief period of time, whether due to malevolent acts, errors, defects or any other factor(s), could result in financial loss, a disruption of our businesses or operations, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have a global business resiliency program that includes disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. Despite our preparations, our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data or funds, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities. In addition, the severity of the failure or disablement may require us to replace or rebuild the affected system(s), application(s) or solution(s) and we may be unable to do so before it materially adversely affects our business or operations.A disruption of the data centers or cloud-computing or other technology services or systems that we utilize could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition or results of operationsWe host our applications and serve our clients with data centers that we operate, and with data centers that are operated, and cloud-computing and other technology services and systems that are provided, by third-party vendors. These data centers or cloud-computing and other technology services and systems have failed, become disabled or been disrupted, and may do so in the future. Any failure, disablement or disruption, even for a limited period of time, could disrupt our businesses or operations and we could suffer financial loss, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our third-party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or cloud-computing or other technology services or systems (including those on which our products or services are based), elect to not renew their agreements or licenses with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, breach their agreements or licenses with us or fail to satisfy our expectations, which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY RISKSOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, including as a result of AI, and if we fail to upgrade, enhance and expand our technology and services to meet 20client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may materially diminishOur businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances (such as AI) and changing client needs and preferences. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology, solutions and services, including by leveraging AI in our solutions. If we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences or our competitors or other third parties respond to such challenges more quickly or successfully than us, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish. As new technologies (such as AI) continue to emerge, they may be disruptive to the HCM industry. These technologies could result in new and innovative HCM products and solutions that could increase competition, place us at a competitive disadvantage or even render obsolete our technology, products and solutions. In addition, investment in product development and new technologies often involves a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development and new technologies. We must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if clients delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy, including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion. We may fail to realize all the economic benefit of our investment in the development of a product which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles and result in a significant charge to earnings.A major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations, or have other adverse consequencesOur business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, access to capital markets and borrowing costs may be adversely affected by a major natural disaster or catastrophic event, including civil unrest, geopolitical instability, war, terrorist attack, pandemics or other (actual or threatened) public health emergencies, extreme weather, such as droughts, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires (including as a result of climate change), or other events beyond our control, and measures taken in response thereto.The COVID-19 outbreak created, and such other events may create, significant volatility and uncertainty and economic and financial market disruption. The extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the event; the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto; actions taken by the Company in response thereto and the related costs; the impact on economic activity and employment levels; the effect on our clients, prospects, suppliers and partners; our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services, including due to travel restrictions, business and facility closures, and employee remote working arrangements; the ability of our clients or prospects to pay for our services and solutions; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In addition, clients or prospects may delay decision making, demand pricing and other concessions, reduce the value or duration of their orders, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Our business is also impacted by employment levels across our clients, as we have varied contracts throughout our business that blend base fees and per-employee fees. Political, economic and social factors may materially adversely affect our business and financial resultsTrade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. A slowdown in the economy or other negative changes, including in employment levels, the level of interest rates or the level of inflation, may have a negative impact on our businesses. In addition, as our operating costs increase due to inflationary pressure or otherwise, we may not be able to offset these increases by corresponding price increases for our products and solutions. Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on HCM services or renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.We invest our funds held for clients in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, such investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or together, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.In addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. In order to satisfy these short-term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute regular reverse repurchase transactions, our committed reverse repurchase agreements, and corporate cash balances. A reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may increase our borrowing costs and/or require us to sell 21available-for-sale securities in our funds held for clients to satisfy our short-term funding requirements. When there is a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, the Company may experience a decline in client fund obligations and may also sell available-for-sale securities in our funds held for clients in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations. A sale of such available-for-sale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients, either or both of which may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.In connection with our client funds assets investment strategy, we attempt to minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by generally impounding the client’s funds at or before the time of payment of such client’s obligation. When we don’t impound client funds by the time we pay such client obligations (including for PEO clients with respect to which we are legally obligated for payroll and tax obligations in respect of WSEs as a Certified PEO), we are at risk of not recovering such funds or a material delay in such recovery. Such risk could be magnified during significant financial or other disruptions or catastrophic events, such as the failure of a bank with whom a significant number of clients may bank at the time or more widespread stress or failure within the U.S. banking system. Any such event could prevent or materially delay the recovery of any funds from clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.We are dependent upon various financial institutions to execute electronic funds transfer and paper check payments as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services. While we have contingency plans in place for isolated bank failures and outages, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process payments on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the United States and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The investment community, clients, regulators, and other stakeholders may have evolving and varied expectations regarding our business, culture, and values.
Negative publicity, regardless of whether claims are accurate, about our brand, our solutions, our data, our culture and values, or our partners, vendors, or employees, could adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our financial results. We publicly share certain information about our corporate social responsibility initiatives and we may face increased scrutiny related to these initiatives. Further, regulations, standards and reporting requirements in this respect continue to evolve, and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions, which may result in legal and regulatory uncertainty as well as increased compliance costs for our business. Our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, or at all, our failure to fully comply with these requirements, or our failure to do so in a timely manner, or a negative perception of our initiatives could adversely impact our reputation, business, including employee recruitment and retention, financial results, and growth.Change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitabilityThe major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us strong, investment-grade long-term debt ratings and high commercial paper ratings. Failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain short-term borrowing required by our business, and adversely impact our results of operations.Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or othersWe have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential clients and business partners and may affect our relationships with current clients, vendors, investors and other third parties. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnelOur ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is, to an important degree, dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated people reflecting diverse perspectives and the diversity of our communities and clients. Competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is increasingly intense, making it more difficult and expensive to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel, results of our operations and culture may suffer.22In addition, the nature of the office environment and remote or hybrid working is changing, which may make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel. It may also present operational and workplace culture challenges that may adversely affect our business.23Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C. CybersecurityRisk management and strategyAt ADP, security is integral to our products, our business processes and infrastructure. We have an enterprise-wide approach to security with the objectives of protecting client data and funds, and preventing security incidents that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems and data that resides in those systems, while also improving our system resilience with the aim of minimizing the impact to our business when incidents do occur.In connection with our business, we collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors, our partners, and our employees, contractors and temporary staff. We also collect significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients and transmit them to their employees, tax authorities and other payees. As the global environment continues to grow increasingly hostile and attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. Although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because unauthorized parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure, retain and dispose of, and the client funds that we collect and transmit.ADP has implemented a cybersecurity program designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. Our cybersecurity policies, processes, and standards are informed by industry practices and by industry frameworks and standards such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and the International Organization for Standardization information security standards, including those standards for which we do not have a certification, but we do exercise judgment in selecting applicable controls from such framework or standards. Our cybersecurity program includes: •Technical Safeguards. We have implemented a layered approach to defend against cybersecurity threats. We periodically evaluate technical controls through application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, and security audits.•Incident Management and Response. A global team monitors our key applications and systems 24/7/365 to detect, investigate and respond to anomalies and incidents. This team addresses reported or detected issues by following a defined incident lifecycle and uses an incident management system to record facts, impact and remedial actions taken. We have established a cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation process, outlining processes for responding to incidents from identification to mitigation and notifying members of senior leadership, the board of directors and external advisors, as appropriate. We test our plans and processes through simulation exercises, scenario planning and tabletop exercises, using findings to improve processes. •External and Internal Assessments. We periodically engage assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties to evaluate our technology, security, and related controls and benchmark against industry practices. We engage in both internal and external assurance and audit activities across the company multiple times a year including an annual third-party review of our overall cybersecurity program. •Threat Intelligence. We maintain affiliations with cybercrime task forces and other third-party monitoring organizations. In addition, we collaborate with professional security organizations, law enforcement and technology companies to proactively identify malicious activity.•Business Resiliency Program.
We have established a global, integrated business resiliency program designed to manage the impacts of technological, environmental, process and health risks on service delivery. This program uses an integrated framework that lays out our mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery process.
•Third-Party Risk Management. We maintain a third-party risk management process, designed to identify and manage risks associated with our vendors, our partners and other third parties, that includes conducting security assessments prior to engagement and periodically during the engagement. We also seek to include security and privacy terms, where appropriate, in our contracts with third-party service providers that require third parties to maintain security controls to protect our data and notify us in the event of a cybersecurity incident.•Security Awareness and Training Program.
Our security training and awareness program is a continuous, dynamic initiative, designed to develop and maintain a security-focused culture and empower our associates to make responsible, secure decisions. As part of this awareness program, we communicate to our associates on a regular basis regarding key security topics and current events, best practices for addressing such cybersecurity threats, and 24gamification to reinforce effective behaviors. All associates are also required to take an annual, interactive security training program that includes an overview of key security topics, policies and responsibilities. We have also integrated cybersecurity related risks into our enterprise risk management program, which is designed to identify, prioritize, assess, monitor and mitigate the various risks confronting ADP, including cybersecurity risks. Our enterprise risk management team conducts a range of activities, including an annual enterprise risk management assessment.We have been, and continue to be, the subject of cybersecurity attacks, including unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, and denial of service. Although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the cybersecurity incidents that we have identified to date have materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, we cannot provide assurances that a cybersecurity incident will not materially affect us, or our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition in the future. For additional information on cybersecurity related risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. GovernanceA cross-functional, enterprise-wide management program operates to evaluate our global cybersecurity program’s effectiveness and members of the Company’s executive committee, through an executive security council, routinely review strategy, policy, program effectiveness, standards enforcement and cyber issue management. Our chief information security officer (“CISO”) leads our global cybersecurity program and oversees the global cybersecurity services team, which is responsible for monitoring, identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threats across ADP. Our CISO reports to our chief security officer (“CSO”), who leads our global security organization and is responsible for cybersecurity, fraud prevention, operational risk management, client security management, and workforce protection. Our CSO has over 25 years of experience in a range of security roles, including serving as a chief security officer at another public company, and participates in various cyber security organizations. The current CISO has served in various roles in cybersecurity and information technology for over 25 years and has attained the professional certification of Certified Information Security Manager.Our board of directors is actively engaged in the oversight of our global cybersecurity program. Our board of directors receives regular, quarterly reports on these matters from our CSO and leadership from our global product and technology organization, including on the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s cybersecurity systems and improve cyber readiness, as well as on existing and emerging threat landscapes. In addition, the corporate development & technology committee of our board of directors receives regular, quarterly reports on our global product security and resiliency program led by leadership from our global product and technology organization with assistance from our CSO. Concurrent and in addition to these reports, our chief administrative officer (“CAO”) (who oversees legal, security and compliance matters) provides a legal, regulatory and ethics update at each meeting of the audit committee of our board of directors, which includes matters of cybersecurity, as appropriate. In addition, important actual or emerging cybersecurity events are communicated to the board of directors by our CAO and Chief Legal Officer, even if immaterial to us. Our global cybersecurity program is subject to an annual third-party assessment overseen by our board of directors and this assessment reviews all aspects of our cyber program. Findings are reported to our board of directors and, in response, ADP develops initiatives to improve our maturity across each of the pillars of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The status of these initiatives is then reviewed with our board of directors during its quarterly meetings. This governance process encourages an environment of continuous improvement. Item 2. PropertiesADP owns 6 of its processing/print centers, and 10 other operational offices, sales offices, and its corporate headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate approximately 2,555,369 square feet. None of ADP’s owned facilities is subject to any material encumbrances. ADP leases space for some of its processing centers, other operational offices, and sales offices. All of these leases, which aggregate approximately 5,640,668 square feet worldwide, expire at various times up to the year 2036. ADP believes its facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsIn the normal course of business, ADP is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, ADP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.25Item 4.

These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW As a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, ADP continuously aims to solve complex business challenges for our clients and their workers. Our Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We see tremendous opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: Leading with Best-in-Class HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients. During fiscal 2025, we continued to make meaningful progress on our Strategic Priorities. We launched ADP Lyric HCM, an all-in-one solution designed to address workplace challenges with personalized experiences that meet client needs. We acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider, and began to integrate it into our global HCM ecosystem to better serve large, global enterprises. We enhanced our distribution network by launching an integrated payroll solution for small businesses. We augmented our global payroll capabilities by continuing to expand our offerings in markets with exciting growth opportunities like Japan and Saudi Arabia, and by acquiring payroll businesses like PEI (Procesamiento Externo de Informacion, S.C.) in Mexico. Lastly, we continued deploying AI tools in our products and across our sales, service, and research and development functions to improve the client experience and drive internal productivity gains. Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2025 include:•Revenue growth of 7% to $20,560.9 million; 7% growth on an organic constant currency•Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 50 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 bps •Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth of 10% and 9%, respectively, to $9.98 and $10.01, respectively•Cash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $3.7B, including $2.4B of dividends and $1.3B of share repurchasesFor fiscal 2025, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% both on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 1% for the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. PEO average worksite employees increased 3% for the year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, our ES new business bookings grew 3% in fiscal 2025, and ES client revenue retention was 92.1%. Our strong retention stems in part from our company-wide client satisfaction scores reaching new record highs for the year. These impressive client satisfaction results were broad-based and are a testament to the product investments we are making to improve the client experience.We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our long term strategy and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2025 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.29RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSTotal RevenuesFor the year ended June 30, respectively:Years EndedJune 30,20252024Total Revenues$20,560.9 $19,202.6   YoY Growth7 %7 %  YoY Growth, Organic Constant Currency7 %6 %Revenues increased in fiscal 2025 due to new business started from new business bookings, strong client retention, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in pricing, an increase in interest on funds held for clients, and the impact from the WorkForce Software acquisition. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the changes in revenue for each of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. Total revenues for fiscal 2025 include interest on funds held for clients of $1,189.1 million, as compared to $1,024.7 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average interest rate earned to 3.2% in fiscal 2025, as compared to 2.9% in fiscal 2024, coupled with an increase in our average client funds balances of 6.4% to $37.6 billion in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.

Additionally, operating expenses increased by $137.3 million due to higher service and implementation costs in support of our growing revenue and by $67.8 million due to an increase in costs related to workers' compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.Research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2025 due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products and the WorkForce Software acquisition.Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2025 due to the WorkForce Software acquisition, amortization of investments in internally developed software primarily for our next-gen products, and amortization of purchased software, partially offset by lower amortization of customer contracts and lists.30Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to increases in selling and marketing expenses of $184.4 million as a result of investments in our sales organization and an increase from acquisition related costs.Interest expense increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase of $51.1 million related to commercial paper and reverse repurchase borrowings as a result of increases in average daily commercial paper borrowings of $0.6 billion, and average reverse repurchase outstanding balances of $1.1 billion, as compared to fiscal 2024, offset by decreases in average interest rates on commercial paper issuances and reverse repurchases of 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2024. Additionally, interest expense increased by $37.9 million related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes during the first quarter ended September 30, 2024.Other (Income)/Expense, netYears ended June 30,20252024$ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds$(319.5)$(241.3)$78.2 Realized losses on available-for-sale securities, net1.7 5.9 4.2 Gain on sale of assets(5.0)(17.1)(12.1)Non-service components of pension income, net(31.3)(34.2)(2.9)Other income, net$(354.1)$(286.7)$67.4 Interest income on corporate funds increased in fiscal 2025 due to higher average investment balances of $9.2 billion as compared to $7.4 billion in fiscal 2024, coupled with an increase in average interest rates of 20 basis points, as compared to fiscal 2024. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on non-service components of pension income, net.In fiscal 2025, the gain on sale of assets of $5.0 million related to sales of buildings.Earnings Before Income Taxes ("EBIT") and Adjusted EBIT For the year ended June 30, respectively:Years EndedJune 30,20252024YoY GrowthEBIT$5,310.1 $4,872.3 9 %  EBIT Margin25.8 %25.4 %50 bpsAdjusted EBIT$5,347.1 $4,890.1 9 %  Adjusted EBIT Margin26.0 %25.5 %50 bpsNote: Numbers may not foot due to rounding.Earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2025 due to the increases in total revenues, partially offset by the increases in total expenses discussed above.
EBIT Margin increased in fiscal 2025 due to contributions from client funds interest revenues, discussed above, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing and implementing our clients on growing revenue, partially offset by increased interest expense and acquisition related expenses.Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin exclude interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client fundsextended investment strategy, and net charges, including certain legal matters, gain on sale of assets, and broad-based optimization initiatives, in the applicable periods.31Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 23.2% and 23.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2025 and a valuation allowance release in fiscal 2024 offset by an increase in the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation in fiscal 2025. Refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 23.2% and 23.0%, respectively.

aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers’ compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. During fiscal 2025, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2025 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $10 million in fiscal 2025 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $3 million in fiscal 2024, which were primarily the results of more favorable actuarial loss development in workers’ compensation reserves. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278 million in July 2025, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2026 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2025 reinsurance policy.OtherThe primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and all other interest income and expense.34Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods: Adjusted Financial MeasuresU.S. GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITNet earnings

Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to broad-based, company-wide initiatives.(e) The income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended June 30, 2025.(f) The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction.
The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.

Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2025 and we have sufficient liquidity.For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements ($7.5 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S. as of June 30, 2025), together with our $10.6 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.
Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper. 37Operating, Investing and Financing Cash FlowsOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are summarized as follows: Years ended June 30,20252024$ ChangeCash provided by (used in):Operating activities$4,939.7 $4,157.6 $782.1 Investing activities(3,035.0)(1,389.0)(1,646.0)Financing activities(6,973.4)(1,431.7)(5,541.7)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents37.3 (22.4)59.7 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents$(5,031.4)$1,314.5 $(6,345.9)Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business, and net favorable changes in the components of operating assets and liabilities, as compared to fiscal 2024.Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the acquisition of WorkForce Software with a net cash disbursement of
$1,158.3 million and timing of the net proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $523.0 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $9,288.1 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, a net increase in cash distributed to our clients that was received from the Internal Revenue Service, and a net increase in payments related to reverse repurchase agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance and redemption of debt.We purchased approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $289.11 during fiscal 2025, as compared to purchases of 5.1 million shares at an average price per share of $244.04 during fiscal 2024. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. Capital Resources and Client Fund ObligationsWe have $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2028, 2030, 2032, and 2034. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our senior unsecured notes.Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.6 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $4.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was 38repaid in early July 2025. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:Years ended June 30,20252024Average daily borrowings (in billions)$4.1 $3.5 Weighted average interest rates4.8 %5.3 %Weighted average maturity (approximately in days)2 days2 days Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. As of June 30, 2025, we had $7.5 billion available to us on a committed basis under the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were $38.4 million and $385.4 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows: Years ended June 30,20252024Average outstanding balances (in billions)$2.9 $1.8 Weighted average interest rates4.8 %5.5 %We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.6 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2026 with a one-year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2029 and June 2030, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2025 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $10.6 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and device payment plan agreement receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through June 30, 2025. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 were $176.8 million, as compared to $211.7 million in fiscal 2024. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 to be between $225.0 million and $250.0 million.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations at June 30, 2025 relate primarily to operating leases (Note 7) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (Note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (Note 12), purchase obligations (Note 13), debt obligations (Note 10) and $875.0 million of interest payments on our debt, of which $121.5 million is expected to be paid within one year. In addition to the obligations described above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2025, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2026, 39total $31,343.3 million, and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $30,985.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278.0 million in July 2025 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2026 policy year. As of June 30, 2025, ADP Indemnity had total assets of $725.4 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $665.7 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. ADP Indemnity paid claims of $6.3 million and $1.1 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Refer to the “Analysis of Reportable Segments - PEO Services” above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity.
In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskOur overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities, client employees or other payees).Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.      We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We attempt to minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by generally impounding the client's funds by the time we pay such client’s obligation. When we don't impound client funds in advance of paying such client obligations, we are at risk of not recovering such funds or material delay in such recovery. Through our client funds investment strategy and client impounding processes, we have consistently maintained the required level of liquidity to satisfy all of our obligations.There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $10.6 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions ($7.5 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S. as of June 30, 2025), and available borrowings under our $10.6 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.40We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, and for single A rated, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities it is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows:Years ended June 30, 20252024Average investment balances at cost:  Corporate investments$9,246.6 $7,397.1 Funds held for clients37,631.2 35,369.5 Total$46,877.8 $42,766.6   Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized   losses/(gains) on:  Corporate investments3.5 %3.3 %Funds held for clients3.2 %2.9 %Total3.2 %3.0 %Net realized losses on available-for-sale securities1.7 5.9  As of June 30:Net unrealized pre-tax losses on available-for-sale securities$(425.7)$(1,515.8)Total available-for-sale securities at fair value$33,777.7 $31,207.5 We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 3.0% in fiscal 2024 to 3.2% in fiscal 2025. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $24 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2026. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2026.We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.41CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.
The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. These estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:Deferred Costs - Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill ContractsDescriptionIncremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) and cost incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the client retention period, depending on the business unit.Judgments and UncertaintiesThe Company has estimated the amortization periods for deferred costs by using its historical client retention rates by business unit to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers. The expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years.Sensitivity of Estimate to ChangeAs the assumptions used to estimate the amortization period of the deferred costs could have a material impact on timing of recognition, we assess the amortization periods annually using historical retention rates. Actual retention rates were not materially different than those used in our calculation to determine the amortization period.
We regularly review our deferred costs for impairment. There were no impairment losses incurred during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, June 30, 2024, or June 30, 2023.Goodwill DescriptionGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.Judgments and UncertaintiesThe Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2025 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.
Sensitivity of Estimate to ChangeSome of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including the weighted-average cost of capital, tax rates, market comparisons, and terminal growth rates. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.42We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2025 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.Income TaxesDescriptionJudgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).
A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Judgments and UncertaintiesThe Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when computing the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions.
Sensitivity of Estimate to ChangeWhile the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $163.0 million and $126.9 million, respectively.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information called for by this item is provided under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” under “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”43Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary DataREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders ofAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.Roseland, New JerseyOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related statements of consolidated earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 6, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Goodwill – Employer Services Reportable Segment— Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. In addition, the discounted cash flow model requires the Company to select an appropriate weighted average cost of capital based on current market conditions as of June 30, 2025. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.Forecasts of future revenue and operating margin from the Company’s next-gen platform, for which there is limited historical data, contribute significantly to the estimate of fair value of a reporting unit within the Employer Services reportable segment with approximately $683 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2025. Given the limited historical data associated with the Company’s next-gen platform, significant management judgment was required to forecast future revenue and operating margin to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. In turn, a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort were required when performing 44audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital, including the involvement of our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital used by management to estimate the fair value contributed by the next-gen platform included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit within the Employer Services reportable segment, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital.•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation models, methodology, and significant assumptions used by the Company, specifically the weighted average cost of capital including:◦Testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s calculation of the weighted average cost of capital.◦Developing a range of independent estimates and compared to the weighted average cost of capital selected by management.•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. Due to the limited historical data for the next-gen platform, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue and operating margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) the historical operating results of the Company’s similar existing platforms, (2) the limited operating results to date of the next-gen platform, (3) internal communications to management and the board of directors, and (4) external communications made by management to analysts and investors.Client Funds Obligations - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionClient funds obligations represent the Company's contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll, tax and other payee payment obligations and are recorded as a liability at the time that the Company impounds funds from clients (i.e., money movement). The Company has reported client funds obligations as a current liability in the consolidated financial statements totaling $31,343.3 million as of June 30, 2025. This money movement activity involves significant amounts of client funds being impounded and remitted to third parties and results in a high volume of transactions. To validate the accuracy and completeness of the client funds obligations reported as of period end, the Company performs complex data extracts in order to reconcile the transactional data to the client funds obligations and funds held for clients balances reported at period end. Given the significant volume of data used in the reconciliation, the complexity of the data extraction, and the reconciliation of the data extracts to the client funds obligations balance reported, auditing the client funds obligations is complex and requires the involvement of data specialists to independently reperform the reconciliation and assist with testing of the completeness and accuracy of client funds obligations reported as of period end, including identifying the manual adjustments identified in management’s reconciliation process. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the Company's client funds obligations included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of general information technology controls over the applications relevant to the money movement reconciliation process.•We tested the effectiveness of (1) management’s controls over the client funds obligations data reconciliation and (2) management’s control to reconcile the consolidated client funds obligations to the corresponding consolidated funds held for clients balance.•We involved data specialists to (1) independently reperform management’s client funds obligations reconciliation and (2) perform data analyses to identify and evaluate recurring and new adjustments to the data extracts in the current period.•For a selection of client funds obligations transactions, we evaluated whether the funds were impounded prior to June 30, 2025, agreed the liability to the corresponding asset balance, and evaluated whether the funds were properly included or excluded from the client funds obligations.•We made a selection of adjustments identified by management’s reconciliation of the transactional data to the client funds obligations balance reported at period end and evaluated whether the adjustments were supported and appropriate to reconcile and validate the client funds obligations balance reported at period end.•We made a selection of disbursements to third parties subsequent to the balance sheet date to evaluate whether they were properly included or excluded from client funds obligations.•We tested the Company’s reconciliation of the consolidated client funds obligations to funds held for clients. 45/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPMorristown, New JerseyAugust 6, 2025 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1968.

the Consolidated Financial Statements(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise stated)NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESA. Basis of Preparation.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees. The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust. The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation” to be characterized as a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and therefore, consolidates the trust. Further information on these funds and the Company’s obligations to remit to its clients’ employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 5, “Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.”The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Certain amounts from the comparative financial statements have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation. B. Description of Business.
The Company is a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solutions. The Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. The primary components of the "Other" category include certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, legal settlements, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and interest expense.C. Revenue Recognition.
Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds, other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions. The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees). The Company enters into service agreements with clients that include anywhere from one service to a full suite of services.
The Company’s agreements vary in duration having a legally enforceable term of 30 days to 7 years.
The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one performance obligation, as they are considered a series of distinct services, and are satisfied over time because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Company performs the services. The Company uses the output method based on a fixed fee per employee serviced to recognize revenue, as the value to the client of the goods or services transferred to date (e.g., number of payees) appropriately depicts our performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. The fees are typically billed in the period in which services are performed. PEO, a component of the HR Outsourcing (“HRO”) business, provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll and payroll taxes, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes. The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the Company does not retain risk and acts as an agent with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement. With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the PEO worksite employer is primarily responsible for providing the service and has discretion in establishing wages.52The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits (i.e., PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs), workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company does retain risk and acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. With respect to these fees, the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service and has discretion in establishing price. We recognize client fund interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Set up fees received from certain clients to implement the Company's solutions are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers revenue associated with these set up fees and records them over the period in which such clients are expected to benefit from the material right, which is approximately five to seven years. Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive to perform its services typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing. We assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history and their intention to pay the consideration. D. Deferred Costs. Incremental Costs of Obtaining a ContractIncremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to eight years, depending on the business unit. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the Company incurs to obtain a contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Costs to fulfill a ContractThe Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill its contracts that i) relate directly to the contract ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Company's performance obligations under the contract and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Costs incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected client relationship period if the Company expects to recover those costs. The expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years. These costs are included in operating expenses. The Company has estimated the amortization periods for the deferred costs by using its historical client retention by business units to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers.E. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Highly liquid investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.F. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.
All of the Company's marketable securities are considered to be “available-for-sale” and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on an aggregate approach basis and are included in other (income)/expense, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings.If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of those two conditions is met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and an amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to the yield using the effective-interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. 53G. Fair Value Measurements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Company’s principal, or most advantageous, market for a specific asset or liability.U.S. GAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows:Level 1
Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in active markets.Level 2
Fair value is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including:· quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;· quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;· inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or· inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.Level 3
Fair value is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows).The Company's corporate investments and funds held for clients (see Note 5) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as described below. Over 99% of the Company's available-for-sale securities included in Level 2 are valued based on prices obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company's Level 2 investments, the independent pricing service uses pricing models for each asset class that are consistent with what other market participants would use, including the market approach. Inputs and assumptions to the pricing model used by the independent pricing service are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the independent pricing service applies available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. For the purposes of valuing the Company’s asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities (that are included within Other securities in Note 5), the independent pricing service includes additional inputs to the model such as monthly payment information, new issue data, and collateral performance. For the purposes of valuing the Company’s Municipal bonds, the independent pricing service includes quoted prices for similar assets, benchmark yield curves, and market corroborated inputs. While the Company is not provided access to the proprietary models of the third party pricing service, each quarterly reporting period, the Company reviews the inputs utilized by the independent pricing service and compares the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service and the Company believes the prices received from the independent pricing service are representative of the prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit price). The Company had no available-for-sale securities included in Level 1 and Level 3 at June 30, 2025.The Company issued four series of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities of 7 and 10-years totaling $4.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The fair value of the Notes are estimated in Note 10 utilizing a variety of inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually. The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service.The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy. The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.H. Property, Plant and Equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the 54improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows:Data processing equipment5 to 10 yearsBuildings20 to 40 yearsFurniture and fixtures4 to 7 yearsI. Leases. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The lease liabilities are measured by discounting future lease payments at the Company’s collateralized incremental borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. ROU assets also include adjustments related to prepaid or deferred lease payments and lease incentives. Lease ROU assets are amortized over the life of the lease and assessed for impairment in the event there is a modification or an early termination.J. Goodwill.
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2025 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. Several of these assumptions, including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences. As such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins. Based upon the quantitative assessment, the Company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired. K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. L. Foreign Currency.
The net assets of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are not significant for all periods presented. M. Foreign Currency Risk Management Programs and Derivative Financial Instruments.
The Company transacts business in various foreign jurisdictions and is therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.55N. Earnings per Share (“EPS”).
The Company computes EPS in accordance with ASC 260. The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:Years ended June 30,BasicEffect of Employee Stock Option SharesEffect ofEmployeeRestrictedStockSharesDiluted2025    Net earnings$4,079.7   $4,079.7 Weighted average shares (in millions)407.1 0.6 1.0 408.7 EPS$10.02   $9.98 2024    Net earnings$3,752.0   $3,752.0 Weighted average shares (in millions)410.6 0.7 0.9 412.2 EPS$9.14   $9.10 2023    Net earnings$3,412.0   $3,412.0 Weighted average shares (in millions)413.7 0.9 1.1 415.7 EPS$8.25   $8.21 Shares that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future include outstanding share-based compensation awards, discussed in Note 11. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, there were no shares excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, and in fiscal 2023, there were 0.2 million shares excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.    O. Stock-Based Compensation.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant, and in the case of international units settled in cash, adjusts this fair value based on changes in the Company's stock price during the vesting period. Time-based restricted stock units are valued based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant and, in the case of performance based restricted stock units, are valued based on the grant date fair value of such awards and are adjusted for changes to probabilities of achieving performance targets. See Note 11 for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs.P. Internal Use Software.
Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized generally over a three to five-year period on a straight-line basis. Software developed as part of the Company's next-generation platforms are depreciated over ten years. The Company begins to capitalize costs incurred for computer software developed for internal use when the preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Capitalization ceases when a computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.Fees related to cloud-based subscriptions for which the Company has the right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period (without significant penalty) and can run the software on internal hardware, or through contract with a third party vendor to host the software, is recognized as an intangible asset and capitalized following the Internal Use Software guidance under ASC 350-40. Subscriptions where the Company accesses the software through the cloud but cannot take 56possession of the software during the hosting period is treated as a service contract, and as such hosting fees are treated as expense.Q. Acquisitions.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company are included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analysis. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. R. Income Taxes.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be “more likely than not,” assuming that these positions will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $163.0 million and $126.9 million, respectively.S. Workers’ Compensation Costs.
The Company employs a third-party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers’ compensation and employer's liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees. In estimating ultimate loss rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employee's job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. The Company has obtained approximately $351 million of irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of licensed insurance companies of AIG to secure TotalSource workers’ compensation obligations if ADP were to fail to reimburse AIG for workers’ compensation payments. The Company had no drawdowns during June 30, 2025 and 2024 under the letters of credit. Additionally, starting in fiscal 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to workers’ compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO services worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limit our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2025 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278 million in July 2025 to enter into a reinsurance arrangement to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2026 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2025 policy.T. Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as claims and assessments arising from litigation and other legal proceedings, contractual indemnities, and tax matters. Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when the Company determines that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of the amount of the loss is a range and some amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued as a liability. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range is accrued as a liability. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. The loss contingencies are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.57If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company will disclose material contingent liabilities when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. Legal fees and other costs related to litigation and other legal proceedings or services are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Any claim for insurance recovery is recognized only when realization becomes probable.U.

Global is generally consistent with the types of services provided within HCM but represent geographies outside of the United States and includes our multinational offerings. HCM and Global revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing solutions for payroll, benefits, talent, retirement services and HR processing and fees charged to implement the Company's solutions for clients.HRO provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. This revenue is primarily driven by PEO. The Company has further disaggregated HRO to separate out its PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through revenues.The Company recognizes client fund interest revenues on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.58The following tables provide details of the Company's revenues and includes a reconciliation to the Company’s reportable segments: Years EndedJune 30,Types of Revenues202520242023HCM$8,674.5 $8,155.7 $7,716.1 HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs3,782.3 3,544.2 3,386.0 PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs4,289.0 3,975.9 3,800.9 Global2,626.0 2,502.1 2,295.8 Interest on funds held for clients1,189.1 1,024.7 813.4 Total Revenues$20,560.9 $19,202.6 $18,012.2 Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025:Types of RevenuesEmployer ServicesPEOOtherTotalHCM$8,684.5 $— $(10.0)$8,674.5 HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs1,394.3 2,390.6 (2.6)3,782.3 PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs— 4,289.0 — 4,289.0 Global2,626.0 — — 2,626.0 Interest on funds held for clients1,178.3 10.8 — 1,189.1 Total Segment Revenues$13,883.1 $6,690.4 $(12.6)$20,560.9 Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024:Types of RevenuesEmployer ServicesPEOOtherTotalHCM$8,164.2 $— $(8.5)$8,155.7 HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs1,299.1 2,248.4 (3.3)3,544.2 PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs— 3,975.9 — 3,975.9 Global2,502.1 — — 2,502.1 Interest on funds held for clients1,015.4 9.3 — 1,024.7 Total Segment Revenues$12,980.8 $6,233.6 $(11.8)$19,202.6 Reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to our reportable segments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023:Types of RevenuesEmployer ServicesPEOOtherTotalHCM$7,724.7 $— $(8.6)$7,716.1 HRO, excluding PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs1,216.1 2,175.9 (6.0)3,386.0 PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs— 3,800.9 — 3,800.9 Global2,295.8 — — 2,295.8 Interest on funds held for clients806.0 7.4 — 813.4 Total Segment Revenues$12,042.6 $5,984.2 $(14.6)$18,012.2 Contract BalancesThe timing of revenue recognition for our HCM, HRO and Global Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients, as invoicing occurs in the period the services are provided.

There were no impairment losses incurred during the period. NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS    In October 2024, the Company acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider that specializes in supporting large, global enterprises, utilizing cash on hand. The results of WorkForce Software are reported within the Company’s Employer Services segment. Pro forma information has not been presented because the effect of the acquisition is not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.The following table reconciles the purchase price to the cash paid for the acquisition, net of cash acquired:Purchase price$1,170.8 Less: cash acquired(12.5)Cash paid for acquisition of business, net of cash acquired$1,158.3 The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the measurement of certain assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information becomes available but will not exceed twelve months from the date of acquisition.60The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the date of acquisition, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation for WorkForce Software is as follows:Cash$12.5 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts20.0 Identifiable intangible assets (1)292.0 Goodwill880.4 Deferred income taxes, net of valuation allowance51.2 All other assets14.8 Total assets acquired$1,270.9 Deferred revenue$39.6 All other liabilities60.5 Total liabilities assumed$100.1 Total net assets acquired$1,170.8 (1)
Intangible assets are recorded at estimated fair value, as determined by management based on available information which includes an estimated valuation by an independent third-party. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods. The major assumptions used in arriving at the estimated identifiable intangible asset values included management’s estimates of future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate rate of return which are based on the weighted average cost of capital for both the Company and other market participants, projected customer attrition rates, as well as applicable royalty rates for comparable assets. The useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows. The estimated fair value of intangible assets and related useful lives as included in the estimated purchase price allocation include:Estimated Fair ValueEstimated Useful Life (in years)Technology$115.0 7Customer/Partner relationships$170.0 8Tradename$7.0 4The goodwill recorded as a result of the WorkForce Software transaction represents future economic benefits the Company expects to achieve as a result of the acquisition, including expected synergies along with the value of the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition is tax deductible.NOTE 4.

SHORT TERM FINANCINGThe Company has a $4.6 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2026 with a one-year term-out option. The Company also has a $3.5 billion
five-year credit facility that matures in June 2029 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. In addition, the Company also has a $2.5 billion five-year credit facility maturing in June 2030 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to SOFR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through June 30, 2025 and 2024 under the credit agreements. The Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In June 2025, the Company increased its U.S. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $10.6 billion from $10.3 billion in aggregate maturity value. The Company’s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. As of June 30, 2025 the Company had $4.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was repaid in early July 2025. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:67Years ended June 30,20252024Average daily borrowings (in billions)$4.1 $3.5 Weighted average interest rates4.8 %5.3 %Weighted average maturity (approximately in days)2 days2 daysThe Company’s U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had $38.4 million and $385.4 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. The Company has $7.5 billion available on a committed basis under the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows: Years ended June 30,20252024Average outstanding balances (in billions)$2.9 $1.8 Weighted average interest rates4.8 %5.5 %NOTE 10. DEBTThe Company issued four series of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities of 7 and 10-years totaling $4.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually.During the first quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes due in 2034 bearing a fixed interest rate of 4.450%. In connection with the senior notes issuance, the Company terminated several derivative contracts in place to hedge exposure in changes in benchmark interest rates for the senior notes issued with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.0 billion (of which $400.0 million were executed during the first quarter ended September 30, 2024 and $600.0 million were executed on the day of issuance). Since these derivative contracts were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $12.5 million was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income and will be amortized to earnings over the life of the respective issued Note as the interest payments are made.During the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes due in 2032 bearing a fixed interest rate of 4.750%. In connection with the senior notes issuance, the Company also terminated several derivative contracts in place to hedge exposure in changes in benchmark interest rates for the senior notes issued with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.0 billion (of which $300.0 million were entered into during the third quarter ended March 31, 2025, $100.0 million were entered into during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2025, and $600.0 million were entered into on the day of issuance). Since these derivative contracts were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $3.0 million was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income and will be amortized to earnings over the life of the respective issued Note as the interest payments are made. During the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company redeemed $1.0 billion of senior notes which were due to mature on September 15, 2025 and were bearing a fixed interest rate of 3.375%.68The principal amounts and associated effective interest rates of the Notes and other debt as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows:Debt instrumentEffective Interest RateJune 30, 2025June 30, 2024Fixed-rate 3.375% notes due September 15, 20253.47%$— $1,000.0 Fixed-rate 1.700% notes due May 15, 20281.85%1,000.0 1,000.0 Fixed-rate 1.250% notes due September 1, 20301.83%1,000.0 1,000.0 Fixed-rate 4.750% notes due May 8, 20324.95%1,000.0 — Fixed-rate 4.450% notes due September 9, 20344.75%1,000.0 — Other2.9 4.1 4,002.9 3,004.1 Less: current portion (a)(1.0)(1.1)Less: unamortized discount and debt issuance costs(27.2)(11.7)Total long-term debt$3,974.7 $2,991.3 (a) - Current portion of long-term debt as of June 30, 2025 is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs. As of June 30, 2025, the fair value of the Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $3,801.5 million. For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing service, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSA.  Stock-based Compensation Plans.  Stock-based compensation consists of the following:The Company's share-based compensation plan consists of stock options, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock, and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan for eligible employees. Beginning in September 2022, the Company discontinued granting stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock. Any such future awards granted September 2022 and after will be grants of time-based restricted stock units and/or performance-based restricted stock units, depending on employee eligibility. Time-based restricted stock unit awards and performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are settled in stock, and awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 19.3 million registered shares were available for future grants, excluding the impact of performance-based restricted stock units outstanding as of June 30, 2025, from the 26.6 million shares previously authorized for issuance under the share-based compensation plan.•Restricted Stock.•Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. Time-based restricted stock units generally vest ratably over 3 years. Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are settled in stock and cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash and cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of share-settled units is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of cash-settled units is recorded over the vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price. Dividend cash equivalents are paid on share-settled units, and dividend cash equivalents are not paid on cash-settled units.
69•Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a one to three-year performance period and a subsequent service period of up to 38 months. Under these programs, the Company communicates “target awards” at the beginning of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from 0% to 200% of the “target awards.” Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.
Performance-based restricted stock units cannot be transferred and are settled in either cash or stock, depending on the employee's home country. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash is recognized over the vesting period initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets. In addition, compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting period during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded based on the probable and actual performance against targets. Dividend equivalents are paid on awards under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.
•Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value of the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period. This plan has been deemed non-compensatory and, therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 4.6 million shares were available for future issuances from the 70.0 million shares previously authorized for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company repurchased 4.4 million shares in fiscal 2025 as compared to 5.1 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2024. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. Cash payments related to the settlement of vested time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units were approximately $24.0 million, $24.1 million, and $23.5 million during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits in each of fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively:Years ended June 30,202520242023Operating expenses$36.0 $30.0 $24.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses193.7 179.5 165.0 Research and development36.4 34.0 30.8 Total pretax stock-based compensation expense$266.1 $243.5 $220.4 Income tax benefit$66.0 $60.2 $54.5 As of June 30, 2025, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards amounted to $0.3 million, $206.8 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of 0.2 years, 1.7 years, and 0.2 years, respectively.70In fiscal 2025, the following activity occurred under the Company’s existing plans:Stock Options:Numberof Options(in thousands)WeightedAverage Price(in dollars)Options outstanding at July 1, 20242,042 $159 Options granted— $— Options exercised(1,004)$154 Options forfeited/cancelled(3)$207 Options outstanding at June 30, 20251,035 $164 Options exercisable at June 30, 2025882 $157 The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options as of June 30, 2025 was $149.3 million and $133.7 million, respectively, of which each have remaining lives of 4 years.

The U.S. pension plan, which is currently closed to new entrants, was frozen effective July 1, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 and onward, participants will retain their accrued benefits and will not accrue any future benefits due to pay and/or service. The plan interest credit rate varies from year-to-year based on the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate. The Company's policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles.71The Company also has various retirement plans for its non-U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (“SORP”). The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain corporate officers upon retirement based upon the officers' years of service and compensation. The SORP, which is currently closed to new entrants, was frozen effective July 1, 2019, with no future accruals due to pay and/or service. A June 30 measurement date was used in determining the Company's benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. The Company is required to (a) recognize in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset for a plan's net overfunded status or a liability for a plan's net underfunded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer's fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The Company's pension plans' funded status as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:June 30,20252024Change in plan assets:Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$1,879.6 $1,854.4 Actual return on plan assets147.7 106.8 Employer contributions20.1 13.4 Currency translation adjustments3.7 0.6 Benefits paid(112.9)(95.6)Fair value of plan assets at end of year$1,938.2 $1,879.6 Change in benefit obligation:Benefit obligation at beginning of year$1,706.2 $1,725.8 Service cost6.0 5.2 Interest cost87.4 84.6 Actuarial loss/(gain) (a)26.0 (14.6)Currency translation adjustments5.9 0.8 Curtailments and special termination benefits(0.3)— Benefits paid(112.6)(95.6)Projected benefit obligation at end of year$1,718.6 $1,706.2 Funded status - plan assets less benefit obligations$219.6 $173.4 (a) The actuarial loss for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to changes in the discount rate.The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 consisted of:June 30,20252024Noncurrent assets$334.2 $286.3 Current liabilities(5.9)(11.1)Noncurrent liabilities(108.7)(101.8)Net amount recognized$219.6 $173.4 The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,694.9 million and $1,688.5 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.72The Company's pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 had the following projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets:June 30,20252024Projected benefit obligation$151.3 $143.7 Fair value of plan assets$36.7 $30.8 The Company's pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 had the following accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets:June 30,20252024Accumulated benefit obligation$107.9 $108.6 Fair value of plan assets$9.2 $7.6 The components of net pension (income)/expense were as follows: 202520242023Service cost – benefits earned during the year$6.0 $5.2 $4.8 Interest cost on projected benefits87.4 84.6 78.2 Expected return on plan assets(116.0)(115.9)(127.5)Net amortization and deferral3.2 2.9 1.9 Special termination benefits, plan curtailments, and settlement charges(0.3)0.3 — Net pension (income)/expense$(19.7)$(22.9)$(42.6)The net actuarial loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are $280.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2025. There is no remaining transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were:

73Plan AssetsThe Company's pension plans' asset allocations at June 30, 2025 and 2024 by asset category were as follows:20252024Cash and cash equivalents5 %— %Fixed income securities69 %63 %U.S. equity securities10 %12 %International equity securities5 %10 %Global equity securities11 %15 %100 %100 %The Company's pension plans' asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long-term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations. The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility. The pension plans' assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations, and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities, and cash.The target asset allocation ranges for the U.S. plan are generally as follows:U.S. fixed income securities60% - 70%U.S. equity securities7% - 17%International equity securities5% - 15%Global equity securities8% - 18%As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the U.S. pension plan asset allocation is within the target ranges. The pension plans' fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans' liabilities. In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment-grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital. The pension plans' equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.
Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities.None of the pension plans' assets are directly invested in the Company's stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Company's participation in equity indices.The pension plans' investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The pension plans have no Level 1 and Level 3 investments at June 30, 2025.

Contributions    During fiscal 2025, the Company contributed $20.1 million to the pension plans. The Company expects to contribute $9.7 million to the pension plans during fiscal 2026.Estimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal 2026 to the year ended June 30, 2030 are $142.4 million, $154.7 million, $157.4 million, $130.0 million, and $130.3 million, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from the year ended June 30, 2031 to the year ended June 30, 2035 are $681.1 million. The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company's pension plans' benefit obligations at June 30, 2025 and includes estimated future employee service.C. Retirement and Savings Plan.
The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 50% of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to 12% of their compensation annually. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately $191.2 million, $184.1 million, and $163.6 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.NOTE 12.

The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2025 and a valuation allowance release in fiscal 2024 offset by an increase in the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation in fiscal 2025.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 23.0% and 23.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance release and an intercompany transfer of certain assets offset by a lower benefit for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2024.76The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:Years ended June 30,20252024Deferred tax assets:Accrued expenses not currently deductible$256.7 $237.4 Stock-based compensation expense56.0 51.3 Foreign tax credits8.8 12.0 Fixed and intangible assets 216.8 194.9 Net operating losses59.3 41.7 Disallowed business interest expense carryforward30.9 — Unrealized investment losses, net98.4 351.4 Other28.5 39.1 755.4 927.8 Less: valuation allowances(23.8)(11.1)Deferred tax assets, net$731.6 $916.7 Deferred tax liabilities:Deferred contract costs$654.0 $620.7 Prepaid expenses103.1 88.8 Prepaid retirement benefits53.1 40.3 Tax on unrepatriated earnings12.0 10.2 Other16.9 20.8 Deferred tax liabilities839.1 780.8 Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets$(107.5)$135.9 There are $56.1 million and $200.2 million of long-term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately $55.2 million as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States. As of June 30, 2025, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability that would occur upon distribution.The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $117.3 million as of June 30, 2025, of which $17.8 million expire through the year ending June 30, 2045 and $99.5 million have an indefinite utilization period. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has approximately $107.3 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards from acquired companies. The net operating losses have an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, of which $16.4 million expire through the year ending June 30, 2036 and $90.9 million have an indefinite utilization period.
The Company has state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $109.2 million as of June 30, 2025, which expire through the year ending June 30, 2045. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $23.8 million and $11.1 million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
Income tax payments were approximately $1,198.0 million, $1,185.2 million, and $1,080.7 million for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $163.0 million, $126.9 million, and $116.9 million, respectively. The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $119.0 million, $91.8 million, and $83.6 million, respectively. The remainder, if recognized, would principally impact deferred taxes.

During the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded interest expense of $4.3 million, $5.7 million, and $9.1 million, respectively. Penalties recorded during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were not significant.At June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company had accrued interest of $36.9 million and $32.6 million, respectively, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities. At June 30, 2025 the Company had accrued penalties of $0.3 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other liabilities. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no accrued penalties recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction. Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows:Taxing JurisdictionFiscal Years under ExaminationU.S. (IRS) 2023 - 2025Arizona2016 - 2020Massachusetts2016 - 2022Michigan2020 - 2023New Jersey2020 - 2022New York City2016 - 2021New York State2019 - 2021India2014 - 2022The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company's Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Company's effective tax rate.If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.    NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESAs of June 30, 2025, the Company has purchase commitments of approximately $1,498.9 million, including a reinsurance premium with Chubb for the fiscal 2026 policy year, as well as obligations related to software license agreements, and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets, of which $331.6 million relates to the year ending 78June 30, 2026, $566.6 million relates to the years ending June 30, 2027 through 2028, $211.9 million relates to the years ending June 30, 2029 through 2030, and the remaining relates to fiscal years thereafter.In May 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed against ADP, TotalSource and related defendants in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaint asserts violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) in connection with the ADP TotalSource Retirement Savings Plan’s fiduciary administrative and investment decision-making. The complaint seeks statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees. The Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter. The Company is vigorously defending against this lawsuit.The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.79NOTE 14.
RECLASSIFICATION OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ("AOCI") Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income/(loss). Other comprehensive income/(loss) results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders' equity.
Other comprehensive income/(loss) was $924.9 million, $497.5 million, and ($312.1) million in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREABased upon similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s strategic business units have been aggregated into the following two reportable segments: Employer Services and PEO Services. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility.The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") is the Chief Executive Officer. For each reportable segment, the CODM uses earnings before income taxes, including plan-to-actual and forecast-to-actual results, to assess segment performance and allocate resources (including personnel and capital resources) amongst its strategic business units. The CODM does not review assets at the reportable segment level, hence segment disclosure relating to total assets has not been provided.80The following tables present the Company's revenues, significant segment expenses, and earnings before income taxes by reportable segment:Year ended June 30, 2025Employer ServicesPEO ServicesTotalRevenues from external customers$12,692.2 $6,679.6 $19,371.8 Interest on funds held for clients1,178.3 10.8 1,189.1 Intercompany revenues 12.6 — 12.6 Total segment revenues13,883.1 6,690.4 20,573.5 Reconciliation of revenues:Intercompany eliminations(12.6)Total consolidated revenues$20,560.9 Less segment expenses: (a)Selling and marketing2,177.1 362.8 Zero-margin benefits pass-through costs— 4,289.0 Worker's compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes— 681.3 Other segment expenses (b)6,697.5 406.8 Total segment earnings before income taxes5,008.5 950.5 5,959.0 Reconciliation of earnings before income taxes:Other (c)(648.9)Total consolidated earnings before income taxes$5,310.1 Year ended June 30, 2024Employer ServicesPEO ServicesTotalRevenues from external customers$11,953.6 $6,224.3 $18,177.9 Interest on funds held for clients1,015.4 9.3 1,024.7 Intercompany revenues 11.8 — 11.8 Total segment revenues12,980.8 6,233.6 19,214.4 Reconciliation of revenues:Intercompany eliminations(11.8)Total consolidated revenues$19,202.6 Less segment expenses: (a)Selling and marketing2,025.0 330.5 Zero-margin benefits pass-through costs— 3,975.9 Worker's compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes— 613.4 Other segment expenses (b)6,400.3 392.3 Total segment earnings before income taxes4,555.5 921.5 5,477.0 Reconciliation of earnings before income taxes:Other (c)(604.7)Total consolidated earnings before income taxes$4,872.3 81Year ended June 30, 2023Employer ServicesPEO ServicesTotalRevenues from external customers$11,222.0 $5,976.8 $17,198.8 Interest on funds held for clients806.0 7.4 813.4 Intercompany revenues 14.6 — 14.6 Total segment revenues12,042.6 5,984.2 18,026.8 Reconciliation of revenues:Intercompany eliminations(14.6)Total consolidated revenues$18,012.2 Less segment expenses: (a)Selling and marketing1,885.3 307.4 Zero-margin benefits pass-through costs— 3,800.9 Worker's compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes— 606.3 Other segment expenses (b)6,183.1 292.3 Total segment earnings before income taxes3,974.2 977.3 4,951.5 Reconciliation of earnings before income taxes:Other (c)(513.9)Total consolidated earnings before income taxes$4,437.6 (a) The significant expense categories and amounts align with the segment-level information that is regularly provided to the CODM.

Controls and Procedures Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of ADP's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and Procedures” section should be read in conjunction with the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP that appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation (the “evaluation”), under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting It is the responsibility of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s (“ADP”) management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to ADP's management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of ADP.83Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of ADP’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this assessment, management determined that ADP’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ADP included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the operating effectiveness of ADP's internal control over financial reporting. The Deloitte & Touche LLP attestation report is set forth below. /s/ Maria BlackMaria BlackChief Executive Officer /s/ Peter HadleyPeter HadleyChief Financial OfficerRoseland, New JerseyAugust 6, 2025 84Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in ADP's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ADP's internal control over financial reporting.85REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders ofAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.Roseland, New JerseyOpinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated August 6, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPMorristown, New JerseyAugust 6, 2025 86Item 9B.
