Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Our consolidated unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. Unless otherwise specified in this annual report, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common stock” refer to shares of our common stock. As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean Greentech Innovations, Inc. a Nevada corporate and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Analog Nest Technologies, Inc. a Nevada corporation, unless otherwise indicated.  3Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2013 under the name UpperSolution.com with the principal business objective of creating an independent and unbiased mobile app that enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their need and getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available. On January 10, 2018, our company, Analog Nest Technologies, Inc. (“Analog Nest”) and the shareholders of Analog (the “Analog Nest Shareholders”) closed a transaction pursuant a share exchange agreement dated January 10, 2018, whereby our company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Analog Nest (the “Analog Nest Stock”) from the Analog Nest Shareholders. In exchange for the Analog Nest Stock our company issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to the Analog Nest Shareholders. Analog Nest was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 8, 2017 as a mobile application (“app”) company focused on utility/entertainment apps for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms. In December 2017, Analog Nest acquired the following apps: Old Fart Booth, Old Fart Booth Pro, Ugly Face Booth, Ugly Santa Booth, Baldy - Bald Photo Booth, Fatty - Make Funny Fat Faces, Slender Man Scary Prank, Anime Booth, Anime Booth Free, Minecart Mayhem, Pimp My Pet, Pimp My Dog, Cavity Detector - Scary Prank, Mustacher, Alex From Target, A Farm Animal Salon, Mustacher Pro, Pimp My Cat, and Animal Dress Up Salon. On June 26, 2019, a majority of our stockholders and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company to “Startech Labs, Inc.” and a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a ninety-five (95) old for one (1) new basis. The name change and reverse stock split became effective on July 17, 2019. On December 1, 2018, the Company disposed of its mobile application company subsidiary, Analog Nest Technologies, Inc. On January 16, 2021, the Company acquired travel booking websites and mobile apps. The Company develops customized web solutions with both commercial and retail applications. Currently focused on further development of fare aggregators and travel metasearch engines, the Company owns and operates international online travel and hospitality web portals where users can search for flights and hotels and select the most economical options. We have not declared bankruptcy, been involved in receivership or any similar proceeding. Our office is located at 244 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016-2817 and our telephone number is (802) 255-4212. We do not own any property and we do not have a corporate website.  4Table of Contents Our Current Business We are in the business of the creation and development of utility/entertainment apps for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Analog Nest. Product Lines Analog Nest operates primarily in the computer/software applications industry and specifically in the development of Android and iOS apps for mobile devices. In the past five years the number of total apps on the Google Play Store has increased from around 200,000 in 2011 to around 1.6 million in 2015 and currently about 2 million apps in the Apple’s App store as well. The Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store are generally referred to herein as an “App Store”. Analog Nest generates revenue from selling certain apps in the App Stores and from displaying advertisements in certain applications. Approximately eighty percent (80%) of Analog Nest revenue is generated from the sales of Apps and the remaining revenue comes for advertising. Market Opportunity With the mobile market still booming, there are billions of mobile devices for which we can offer Apps. Given this large number of available devices, even the smallest App ideas have the potential to generate millions of downloads for its developer. Competitive Strengths We believe that the Apps have a solid reputation in the App Stores - some Apps are within the top 1,000 of their categories in the US and also top 10,000 out of all apps on the Google Play Store. We believe that our Apps are for most part unique with solid source codes. Many of the other apps on the market are copycat apps, as opposed to a majority of Analog Nest Apps which are original and unique in their region. We attempt to distinguish the Apps by providing prompt customer services. Customers and Marketing Analog Nest has an aggregate of approximately nine million downloads of its Apps from users around the globe, with the US taking the majority of that share. So far no specific marketing for our Apps has been done. Due to the high ranking and ratings of the Apps, the optimized app store app descriptions, the user’s acquisition is done either directly through play store search or via deep linking from within the other Apps in the portfolio. Having a large portfolio of Apps helps drive more downloads, since each App can serve ads for the other Apps on the portfolio. With the introduction of Google’s Universal app campaigns a new marketing opportunity has been given to the app vendors to better target audiences through the Google Ad network in an efficient and cost effective way. Using Google’s Universal app campaigns, the goal is to target 1 million new installs or downloads in the next 12 months. To achieve this number of installs a marketing budget of at least $100,000 USD will be required to generate a lot of installs on a cost per install (CPI) basis. Competition The app industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of apps to be introduced. In addition, we have limited experience in developing apps for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain. As we continue to devote resources to developing apps for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies and new-comers.  5Table of Contents Regulatory Matters Google and Apple are responsible for regulating their respective app stores. Their stringent rules and guidelines make it so that app developers are mostly shielded from government regulatory bodies as each app goes through a manual approval process before being published on the store. If Google or Apple believe that such app could be in breach of any laws, they simply do not approve it. Government Regulation We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. Employees Other than our directors and officers, who provide their services to our company and independent consultants, we have no full time employees. Recent Business Development We have expanded their suite of travel and metasearch offerings by completing development and the launch of 2 additional sites, www.gohotelbookings.com and www.goflightsnow.com, to complement their existing offerings www.gotravelbookings.com and www.gohotelflights.com. Along with their existing Android App GoTravelBookings, the registrant hopes to further grow the easily recognizable “Go” Branding to offer both Leisure and Business Travelers a full suite of services, to coincide with the potential resumption of travel in the mid to long term. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.  6Table of Contents ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY We have implemented cybersecurity risk management procedures, in accordance with our risk profile and business size. We rely on our information technology to operate our business. As such, we have policies and processes designed to protect our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, and resolve issues in a timely manner in the event of a cybersecurity threat or incident. We have designed our business applications to minimize the impact that cybersecurity incidents could have on our business and have identified back-up systems where appropriate. We seek to further mitigate cybersecurity risks through a combination of monitoring and detection activities, use of anti-malware applications, employee training, quality audits and communication and reporting structures, among other processes. We have a trained group of people to carry out the activities of monitoring and detection of cybersecurity threats and respond to any cybersecurity threats or incidents. The Head of IT department is responsible for oversight of cybersecurity risks and addressing potential cybersecurity risks to business programs, employees, clients, vendors and partners. The Head of IT Department reports to our Chief Executive Officer who reports to the Audit Committee at the board-level, as appropriate. As of March 31, 2025, we have not identified an indication of a cybersecurity incident that would have a material impact on our business and financial statements.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our address principal executive office is located at 244 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016-2817. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. To date, our company has never been involved in litigation, as either a party or a witness, nor has our company been involved in any legal proceedings commenced by any regulatory agency against our company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable.  7Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are listed for quotation on the Pink sheets of the OTC Markets under the trading symbol “URSL”. Trading in stocks quoted on the Pink Sheets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects. Pink Sheet securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Pink Sheet securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Pink Sheet issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. Holders As of August 4, 2025, we had 3 shareholders of record of our common stock with 606,475 shares of common stock outstanding. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. Equity Compensation Plans Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the company has limited cash resources at this time, it may issue shares or options to or enter into obligations that are convertible into shares of common stock with its employees and consultants as payment for services or as discretionary bonuses. Recent Sales of unregistered securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There were no repurchases of common stock for the year ended May 31, 2025. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Not Applicable. ITEM 7.

These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “we believe,” “management believes” and similar language. Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere in this current report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

We estimate total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $30,000. Contractual Obligations As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  10Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2025, and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going ConcernThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statement, the Company incurred a net loss of $(60,650) and an accumulated deficit of $(39,149,633), the continuation of the Company as a going concern, is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders and lenders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external fund providers will provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MattersCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As of May 31, 2025, below is the critical audit matters communicated. Critical Audit Matter Description Going Concern Uncertainty – See also Going Concern Uncertainty explanatory paragraph aboveAs described in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has significant operating losses and a working capital deficiency. Furthermore, the company has convertible notes of $129,402 and accrued convertible notes interest of $169,341 exceeding the principal amount borrowed. Furthermore, the company has limited number of unissued shares that can be issued in future for sales in order to generate working capital. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on embarking on a profitable business venture or obtaining additional financing from the shareholders or working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities to execute its plans and continue operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The procedures performed to address the matter included. (i)We inquired of executive officers, and key members of management, of the Company regarding factors that would have an impact on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.(ii)We performed testing procedures such as analytical procedures to identify conditions and events that indicate that there could be substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.(iii)We reviewed and evaluated management plan for dealing with adverse effects of these conditions and events(iv)We assessed the possibility of raising additional debt or credit,(v)We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  /S/ Boladale Lawal Boladale Lawal & CO (PCAOB ID 6993)   We have served as the Company's auditor since 2024Lagos, NigeriaAugust 29, 2025  F-2Table of Contents GREENTECH INNOVATIONS, INC.(Formerly STARTECH LABS, INC.)BALANCE SHEETS   May 31,  May 31,   2025  2024 ASSETS             TOTAL ASSETS $-  $-          LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT        Current Liabilities        Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $4,503  $2,701 Accrued interest  169,341   139,791 Due to related party  131,117   101,819 Convertible notes  129,402   129,402 Total Current Liabilities  434,363   373,713          TOTAL LIABILITIES  434,363   373,713          STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT        Common Stock: $0.001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized, 606,475 and *606,475 shares issued and outstanding, respectively  606   606 Additional paid-in capital  38,714,664   38,714,664 Accumulated deficit  (39,149,633)  (39,088,983)Total Stockholders' Deficit  (434,363)  (373,713)         TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT $-  $-  *Retrospectively restated reverse stock split 1:100 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-3Table of Contents GREENTECH INNOVATIONS, INC.(Formerly STARTECH LABS, INC.)STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS   For the Year Ended   May 31,  May 31,   2025  2024        Operating Expenses      General and administration $3,322  $6,221 Professional  27,777   29,248 Total operating expenses  31,099   35,469          Net loss from operations  (31,099)  (35,469)         Other expense        Interest expense  (29,551)  (29,632)Total other expense  (29,551)  (29,632)         Net loss before taxes  (60,650)  (65,101)Provision for income taxes  -   - Net loss $(60,650) $(65,101)         Net Loss Per Common Share – Basic and Diluted $(0.10) $(0.11)         Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding  606,475   606,475  The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-4Table of Contents GREENTECH INNOVATIONS, INC.(Formerly STARTECH LABS, INC.)STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICITFOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2025 AND MAY 31, 2024      Additional     Total   Common stock  Paid-in  Accumulated  Shareholders'   Shares  Amount  Capital  Deficit  Deficit                 Balance, May 31, 2023  606,475  $606  $38,714,664  $(39,023,882) $(308,612)Net loss   -   -   -   (65,101)  (65,101)Balance, May 31, 2024  606,475  $606  $38,714,664  $(39,088,983) $(373,713)Net loss   -   -   -   (60,650)  (60,650)Balance, May 31, 2025  606,475  $606  $38,714,664  $(39,149,633) $(434,363) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-5Table of Contents GREENTECH INNOVATIONS, INC.(Formerly STARTECH LABS, INC.)STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS   For the Year Ended   May 31,  May 31,   2025  2024        Cash Flows from Operating Activities:      Net loss $(60,650) $(65,101)Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities:        Changes in operating assets and liabilities:        Accounts payable  1,802   (642)Accrued interest  29,550   29,632 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  (29,298)  (36,111)         Cash Flows from Financing Activities:        Advancement from director  29,298   36,111 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  29,298   36,111          Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents  -   - Cash and Cash Equivalents, beginning of period  -   - Cash and Cash Equivalents, end of period $-  $-          Supplemental Disclosure Information:        Cash paid for interest $-  $- Cash paid for taxes $-  $-  The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.  F-6Table of Contents GREENTECH INNOVATIONS, INC.(Formerly STARTECH LABS, INC.)NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMAY 31, 2025 NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name Greentech Innovations, Inc.

The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. Basis of Presentation The Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is May 31.  F-7Table of Contents  Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Related Party Balances and Transactions The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (See Note 5) Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with Codification topic 260, “Earnings Per Share” for the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share has not been presented because there are no dilutive items. Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive stock options, warrants, and convertible debt are converted or exercised by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Options, warrants and/or convertible debt will have a dilutive effect, during periods of net profit, only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise or conversion price of the items. For the year ended May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, respectively, the following convertible notes were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:   May 31,  May 31,   2025  2024   (Shares)  (Shares) Convertible notes payable  477,490   477,490  Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  F-8Table of Contents  Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 – Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.  Share-based Expenses ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services and non-employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees and non-employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Income Tax Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. (See Note 7) Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have evaluated all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that these accounting pronouncements will have any material impact on our financial statements or disclosures upon adoption.  F-9Table of Contents  Recently adopted accounting standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.” The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a CCF and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). With the adoption of ASU 2020-06, entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature these debts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures.  In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments in this update expand segment disclosure requirements, including new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment among other disclosure requirements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.The adoption of ASU 2023-07 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 provide for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 has not had a material effect on the Company’s statements and disclosures. NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses since inception on April 20, 2013 through May 31, 2025 totaling $39,149,633 and has negative working capital of $434,363 at May 31, 2025. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with research and development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon funds from the sale of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through related party proceeds. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through related party issuances, debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above.  F-10Table of Contents NOTE 4 – COMMON STOCK The Company has authorized seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. On April 25, 2025, the Company approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to one hundred (100) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation Of Disclosure Controls And Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (our chief executive officer), we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Management’s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for our company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  12Table of Contents Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of May 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date due to the factors stated below. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses: Insufficient Resources: We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. Inadequate Segregation Of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. Lack Of Audit Committee & Outside Directors On The Company’s Board Of Directors: We do not have a functioning audit committee or outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in the future. Management, including our chief executive officer, has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report. Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Except as provided above, there is no information to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Form 10-K that has not been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  13Table of Contents PART III ITEM 10.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on August 26, 2024. As of August 4, 2025, there were 606,475 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.  16Table of Contents Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the company has limited cash resources at this time, it may issue shares or options to or enter into obligations that are convertible into shares of common stock with its employees and consultants as payment for services or as discretionary bonuses. The company does not have any arrangements for such issuances or arrangements at this time. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended May 31, 2025, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last three completed fiscal years. During the year ended May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, the Director of the Company made advancement of $29,298 and $36,111 for operating expenses on behalf of the Company, respectively. As of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, the amount due to director was $131,117 and $101,819 respectively. ITEM 14.
