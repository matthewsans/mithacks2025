Information
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This
annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
(the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)
that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. For this purpose,
any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking, including, but
not limited to, statements relating to our future actions, intentions, plans, strategies, objectives, results of operations, cash flows
and the adequacy of or need to seek additional capital resources and liquidity. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as “may”,
“should”, “expect”, “project”, “plan”, “anticipate”,
“believe”, “estimate”, “intend”, “budget”, “forecast”,
“predict”, “potential”, “continue”, “should”, “could”,
“will” or comparable terminology or the negative of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
however, the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements by their nature
involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially depending
on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, economic conditions
generally and in the industry in which we and our customers participate; competition within our industry; legislative requirements or
changes which could render our products or services less competitive or obsolete; our failure to successfully develop new products and/or
services or to anticipate current or prospective customers’ needs; price increases; employee limitations; or delays, reductions,
or cancellations of contracts we have previously entered into; sufficiency of working capital, capital resources and liquidity and other
factors detailed herein and in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or
“Commission”). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated.
Forward-looking
statements are predictions and not guarantees of future performance or events. Forward-looking statements are based on current industry,
financial, and economic information that we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly abrupt
changes. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements due to risks and
uncertainties associated with our business. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, activity levels, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person
assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements, and we hereby qualify all our forward-looking
statements by these cautionary statements.
These
forward-looking statements speak only as of their dates and should not be unduly relied upon. We undertake no obligation to amend this
report or revise publicly these forward-looking statements (other than pursuant to reporting obligations imposed on registrants pursuant
to the Exchange Act) to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, whether as the result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report
and in our other filings with the Commission.

Organizational
Background
Java
Express, Inc., was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, for the purpose of selling coffee and other
related items to the general public from retail coffee shop locations. These endeavors ceased in 2006, and it had no material business
operations from 2006 until March of 2013. On March 29, 2013, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, Anew Acquisition
Corp., a Utah corporation (“Merger Sub”), and ANEW LIFE, INC., a Utah corporation (“ANEW LIFE”), executed and
delivered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into ANEW
LIFE, ANEW LIFE was the surviving company under the merger and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on the closing of the
merger (the “Merger”). On April 17, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada to change its name from “Java Express, Inc.” to “Sundance Strategies, Inc.” Sundance Strategies,
Inc. is referred to as “the Company”, “us”, or “we”.
Our
Business
Our
historical business model has focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products
tied to life insurance policies, including notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part
or all of the sales price of insurance, life settlements, and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace,
often referred to as the “life settlements market.”
We
currently do not hold life settlement or life insurance policies but, instead, previously held a contractual right to receive the net
insurance benefits, or “NIBs”, from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party (“the Owners”
or “the Holders”). These NIBs represented an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance
policies, and they allowed us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after expenses related to the acquisition,
financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid.
NIBs
are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through
a subsidiary, such an entity is referred to herein as a “Holder.” A Holder, directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary,
purchases life insurance policies from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies. At the
time of purchase, the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity, (ii)
considers purchasing mortality re-insurance (“MRI”) coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder in the event
the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the initial purchase
of the insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums. The financing
obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the
financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for their servicing, MRI coverage
and financing, then the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right to receive
the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid. When an
insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with such policy.
Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay us for the remaining
insurance proceeds.
During
the latter part of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we began developing an additional business offering, providing professional
services to specialty structured finance groups, bond issuers and life settlement aggregators. We have assembled an experienced team
from the life settlement marketplace, as well as from other areas such as financial services and public financial markets. As a professional
services provider, we apply industry best practices to advise on the selection of specific portfolios of life insurance policies that
are tailored to meet the needs of its clients. Our clients may include bond issuers, bond investors, or other structured finance product
issuers. We develop strategies and methodologies which include the acquisition of life insurance portfolios, then use common structured
finance techniques and proprietary analytics to structure bonds for issuances, including principal protected bonds. Our goal is to deliver
long-term value and profitability to shareholders by growing our professional services business and asset base, resulting in the ability
to pay dividends to its shareholders.

During
the latter part of the year ended March 31, 2021, we began working closely with bond placement agents and aggregators to establish various
aspects of a proprietary, investment grade bond offering. In this arrangement, we participate as the sole originator in the role of structuring
and advising on the structure of the proprietary bond instrument. Included in the role of structuring financial assets, we use proprietary
analytics to establish the makeup of the rated instrument, including but not limited to life settlement assets (life insurance policies)
and managed cash, and implement a process of selective assembly of the underlying assets and cash management that will meet the policy
requirements and analytics. We provide current and ongoing resources for all analytics, as well as advisement support for the investment
and non-investment grade ratings for the managed asset pool and the managed cash accounts. In our advisory role, we are reimbursed for
all expenses associated with the structuring and preparation of any bond offering, will receive an advisory payment upon the closing
of any bond offering, and then will hold residual rights on the balance of assets once the bond is retired.
Life
Settlements Market
There
are a number of reasons a policy owner may choose to sell his or her life insurance policy. The policy owner may no longer need or want
his or her policy, he or she may wish to purchase a different kind of insurance policy, premium payments may no longer be affordable
or the policy owner may need cash to fund healthcare or other expenses. In particular, policy holders 65 years of age and older and their
families are faced with a variety of challenges as they seek to address their post-retirement financial needs and selling one’s
life insurance policy may provide a unique and valuable financial solution to such challenges. From the early 2000s through 2008, the
market for newly originated life settlements grew from virtually no activity to a peak of an estimated $12 billion of face value of U.S.
life settlement policies settled annually in 2007 and 2008. Economic factors slowed the growth in 2009, when an estimated $8 billion
of face value of U.S. life insurance was settled and growth has continued to decline since that time. Participants in the secondary life
settlement market have included major insurance companies which have purchased available pools of policies for their own investment,
portfolio aggregators, private equity funds, and independent third-party investors.
Predictability
of Future Cash Flows. Predictability of future cash flows is one of the biggest challenges facing companies engaged in the life
settlements industry. If a Holder is not able to adequately predict future cash flows and does not continually have enough cash to make
a policy portfolio’s premium payments, the policies in the portfolio may lapse and we may lose our right to receive the proceeds
from the settlement of the policies at maturity. Prediction of future cash flow requires the use of financial models, which rely on various
assumptions. These assumptions include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counterparty performance
risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount
rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties
and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result,
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. If projections of life expectancies are wrong, Holders may be obligated
to service the related insurance policies for longer than expected, thereby increasing their costs and reducing the net insurance benefit
available.
Financing
a portion of the purchase price. Financing a portion of the purchase price of a policy portfolio allows the Holder to leverage
its investment and create a larger and diversified policy portfolio. When making an investment in a portfolio of life insurance policies,
a Holder utilizes actuarial tables to determine when the policies in the portfolio can be expected to come to maturity. However, the
Holder assumes the risk that the policies in the portfolio will come to maturity later than was predicted by the actuarial tables used
at the time of purchase. The life expectancies provided by the actuarial tables are based on actual death rates in large populations
of individuals with similar demographic characteristics. Thus, the more policies underlying a policy portfolio, the more reliable the
use of actuarial tables becomes. In other words, the larger the policy portfolio, the more closely the underlying insureds would be expected
to, on average, follow actuarial predictions and the lower the risk associated with future cash flows will be. Because of the general
uncertainty of maturity of life insurance policies, financing for their purchase and servicing has historically been difficult to secure.
The lender (the “Holders’ Lender”) has provided funding to the Holders to finance the purchase of the insurance policies.
We believe there are few lenders within this market.
5
Mortality
Re-Insurance (MRI) Coverage. Because of the uncertainty of maturity of insurance policies the Holders had, on occasion, previously
contracted with an insurance provider for MRI coverage. MRI coverage typically provides guaranteed cash flow based on the expected death
benefits of the pool of policies being insured calculated at the issuance of the coverage, thereby providing credit enhancement to any
bank providing financing to a Holder. The term of the MRI policies is usually 15 years. Any claims paid by the MRI to the Holder must
be paid back to the MRI provider out of death benefit proceeds from the pool of policies being insured when such death benefit proceeds
are eventually received. This enables the Holder to receive a smoother cash flow from a pool of policies over time and avoid “lumpiness”
in the cash flows that would otherwise be more pronounced in the absence of the MRI coverage. Any claim payment balances would accrue
interest, typically at a spread of 250 basis points over LIBOR, to the extent they remain outstanding. The MRI coverage is obtained by
paying an MRI premium, typically equal to 2% of the cumulative death benefit of the covered life insurance policies, at the outset of
the coverage and, depending on the specific terms of the MRI policy, possibly an additional premium amount at a predetermined time during
the effective coverage period (the “Commitment Fee”), which is typically 1% of the cumulative death benefits of the covered
policies. The insurer under the MRI policy typically must approve the sale of any life insurance policies covered by the MRI policy if
such sale does not result in the full repayment of any outstanding recovery amounts. It is our understanding that there is only one MRI
Provider. While the MRI coverage is relatively expensive, we believe that insurance policies that MRI covers have less volatility, are
more liquid and should achieve higher values for purposes of financing and secondary market sales.
Financing
a policy portfolio’s premium payments gives a Holder additional cash needed to satisfy the premium obligations of its portfolio.
In addition, obtaining an MRI increases the probability that the Holder will receive future cash flows in the event that the underlying
insureds live longer than expected. This combination provides the Holder with sufficient liquidity to stabilize its cash position.
Life
Settlement Purchasing Guidelines as an Advisor
Our
objective is to advise and assist entities as they acquire life insurance policies and portfolios that will produce returns in excess
of all purchase, financing, servicing and insuring costs incurred by the Holder. The guidelines we generally follow regarding the purchase
of policies and portfolios include:
●
the
insured is 75 years old or older;
●
all
NIBs relate to U.S. Universal Life Insurance policies;
●
all
underlying insurance policies have qualified for financing that will cover at least four years of premiums;
●
each
policy must first be reviewed by the legal due diligence team of the lender providing financing for the acquisition and servicing
of the life insurance policies, second by the MRI company’s due diligence team and then finally approved by our due diligence
processes;
●
all
policies must qualify for MRI; and
●
the
projected proceeds payable on each life insurance policy upon the death of the underlying insured are projected to exceed the costs
to service the life insurance policies, amounts due to creditors secured by such life insurance policy, such as the Holders’
Lender or the MRI provider, other costs and fees incurred by the Holder and the percentage of the remaining insurance benefit retained
by the Holder
Competition
We
encounter significant competition in the life settlements industry generally from numerous companies, including hedge funds, investment
banks, secured lenders, specialty life insurance finance companies and life insurance companies themselves who purchase life settlements.
Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have a significantly lower cost of funds because
they have greater access to insured deposits or the capital markets. Moreover, some of these competitors have significant cash reserves
and can better fund shortfalls in collections that might have a more pronounced impact on companies such as ours. They also have greater
market share. For example, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a portfolio of $300 million (face value) in life insurance policies in 2013.
According to The Deal Pipeline, total life settlement transactions grew to $2.57 billion (face value) in 2013. In 2014 transaction
volumes were reported higher by market participants in all major segments of the industry and Conning & Co. forecast an average annual
gross market potential for life settlements of $180 billion from 2014-2023, with an average volume of approximately $3 billion per year
in life settlement transactions.
A
report from the AAP Life Settlement Market Update indicated that internal rates of return for life settlement transactions conducted
in 2013 were in the high teens, an attractive return at a time when fixed income and other hedge positions were delivering minimal rates
of return. If certain better-financed companies make a significant effort to compete against our business or the secondary market in
general, prices paid for existing portfolios of life insurance policies may rise and our ability to purchase satisfactory assets may
decline. In addition, recent shrinking of the market for life settlements has resulted in fewer available pools of insurance policies.
As a result, price competition for the remaining pools has increased. Our limited resources prohibit us from competing for larger pools.
These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk.

Item
1A. Risk Factors
We
have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and future growth prospects. Any of these risks could harm our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are
not the only ones we face. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part
of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated
financial statements and related notes.
Summary
of Risk Factors
Our
business is subject to several risks and uncertainties, including those described at length in the Risk Factors section below. We consider
the following to be our most material risks:
Risks
Relating to Our Business
●
We
have historically used significant amounts of cash in operating activities since our inception and may continue to use significant
amounts of cash for operating activities in the foreseeable future.
●
We
may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to
obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization
efforts or cause us to become insolvent.
●
There
may be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we will need additional financing to execute our business
plan, to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern.
●
We
may default on our obligations under various debt arrangements, which may accelerate our repayment obligations or otherwise limit
our access to future financing.
●
Our
management team relies on outside consultants and others in our industry to make informed business decisions; potential conflicts
of interest involving those parties who are relied upon could adversely affect the execution of our business model.
●
Current
and future federal regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act’s consumer protection provisions may have an adverse effect on our business
and our planned business operations.
●
General
economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business.
●
The
costs in time and expense of being a publicly-held company are substantial and will only increase if our business model is successful.
●
Inadequate
funding will impede execution of our business model.
●
We
are new to the bond, life settlement, and financial advisory industry and may not be able to successfully compete in this industry.
●
Historically,
99% of our total assets are interests in life settlement policies, resulting in a lack of diversification of assets and concentration
in assets that are subject to significant fluctuations in value.
●
Limitations
to the financial model we use may result in inaccurate or incomplete projections of future cash flow from the insurance policies.
●
The
individuals insured by the life insurance policies may live longer than their actuarial life expectancies and thereby, cash flows
from life insurance policies may be delayed.
7
●
Having
relatively few insureds could cause the overall performance to be unduly influenced by a relatively small number of underlying policies
that perform better or worse than expected.
●
Increased
general market interest rates could increase the carrying costs of the life insurance policies and reduce the related cash flows.
●
Changes
to foreign banking laws and regulations or decreased lending capacity for life settlements could have a negative impact on ability
of Holders to obtain loans with respect to purchases of life settlements.
●
Holders
may be required to obtain MRI coverage as a condition of our business model, which, if unavailable, could potentially increase our
risk of failure.
●
The
lapse of life insurance policies will result in the entire loss of our interest in the death benefits from those particular policies.
●
Actual
results from life settlement products may not match expected results, which could reduce returns and also adversely affect the ability
to service and grow a portfolio for actuarial stability.
●
The
limited number of sellers of life settlement products in the secondary market may limit the ability to negotiate favorable prices
in the acquisition of such life settlement interests.
●
We
do not track concentrations of pre-existing medical conditions of insureds in our guidelines for purchasing life settlement products.
●
If
life settlement products are determined to be “securities,” Holders may be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, which would substantially increase SEC reporting costs and oversight of a Holder’s business
operations.
●
There
is poor liquidity in the secondary market for life insurance and life settlements.
Risks
Related to the Life Insurance Policies
●
Life
settlements, and therefore our common stock, are highly speculative and may lose all of their value.
●
Policies
may be determined to have been issued without an “insurable interest” and could be void or voidable.
●
Additional
insurable interest concerns regarding life insurance policies originated pursuant to premium finance transactions may also result
in adverse decisions that could effect policies.
●
Fraud
in the application for life insurance can also affect assets and interest in policies.
●
The
risk of litigation with issuing insurance companies could substantially raise our costs of operation and increase our risk of loss.
●
The
contestation of the life insurance policies by the applicable issuing insurance companies could result in the loss of the benefits
from such life insurance policies.
●
Increases
in cost of insurance could reduce estimated returns and lower revenues.
●
Carrier
and service partner credit risk can adversely affect life settlements.
●
The
inability to keep track of the insureds could keep us from updating the medical records of the insured.
●
Lost
insureds can result in a delay or a loss of an insurance benefit that would have a negative effect on revenues and prospects.
●
U.S.
life settlement and viatical regulations may result in determination(s) of applicable law violations.
●
State
protections for the insolvency of an insurance company are limited.
●
Liability
for failing to comply with U.S. privacy safeguards.
●
Cyber-attacks
or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.
●
U.S.
privacy concerns may affect the access to accurate and current medical information regarding the insured under life insurance policies.
Risk
Factors Related to Our Common Stock
●
There
is a limited public market for our common stock, and any market that may develop could be volatile.
●
We
are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies
will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
●
Our
management and two stockholders beneficially own approximately 65% of our outstanding common stock and therefore can exert control
over our business.
●
Future
sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital in the future, resulting in our
inability to raise required funding for our operations.
8
Risk
Factors relating to Our Business
We
have historically used significant amounts of cash in operating activities since our inception and may continue to use significant amounts
of cash for operating activities in the foreseeable future.
We
have historically used substantial amounts of cash in operating activities. To date, our operations have not generated sufficient cash
flow to fund our operations, and we have relied on cash provided by financing activities, including amounts received under notes payable
and lines-of-credit with related parties. Our default under these obligations may also limit our ability to obtain future financing from
related or third parties.
Our
inability to access capital may limit our ability to adequately fund our operations. In order to continue to fund our operations, including
the potential purchase of NIBs, we will need to raise substantial amounts of capital. Absent additional financing, we will not have the
resources to execute our business plan.
We
may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain
additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization
efforts or cause us to become insolvent.
We
will need to raise additional funds through future equity or debt financings in the near future to meet our operational needs and capital
requirements. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in raising funds pursuant to additional equity or debt financings
or that such funds will be raised at prices that do not create substantial dilution for our existing stockholders. Given the volatility
of our stock price, any financing that we undertake could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.
To
date, we have financed our operations primarily through net proceeds from the issuance of capital stock and debt financings. We do not
know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. We cannot be certain that additional capital
will be available as needed on acceptable terms, or at all.
We
may raise additional funds in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs.
Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive
covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for
us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. In addition, future equity investors may require that we convert all
or a portion of our debt to equity, and our debtholders may not agree to such terms. If we raise additional funds through further issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities, and/or if we convert all or a portion of our existing debt to equity, our existing stockholders
could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,
preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing
on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may significantly scale back our operations or we may become insolvent. If this were
to occur, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.
There
may be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we will need additional financing to execute our business
plan, to fund our operations and to continue as a going concern.
Since
inception, we have experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows and we expect to continue to generate operating losses
and consume significant cash resources for the foreseeable future. There may be substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as
a going concern. We have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2025 do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty, with the exception that all borrowings
are classified as current on the balance sheets.
Our
inability to access capital may limit our ability to adequately fund our operations and continue as a going concern. Management plans
to address these conditions through (i) continued pursuit of private placements and debt financing, (ii) cost management initiatives
to reduce G&A expenses, and (iii) negotiating extensions on related-party credit lines. The Company believes these actions will provide
sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs for the next 12 months, although uncertainty remains. Absent additional financing, we
will not have the resources to execute our business plan and continue as a going concern beyond 12 months.
9
Inadequate
funding will impede execution of our business model.
At
present, we are a minor participant in both the life settlement market and in the bond advisory industry. We face significant competition
from much larger competitors. We will need substantial additional funds to effectively compete in these industries, and no assurance
can be given that we will be able to adequately fund our current and intended operations. We expect to finance our operating working
capital requirements, with proceeds from planned public and/or private offerings of our securities and debt financing. There can be no
assurance that we will be successful in raising debt or equity capital or that we will be successful in raising additional capital in
the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient funding to execute our business strategies,
we may be required to scale back or discontinue our operations, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.
We
may default on our obligations under various debt arrangements, which may accelerate our repayment obligations or otherwise limit our
access to future financing.
If
we fail to make timely repayments of amounts received under notes payable and lines-of-credit with related parties or the 8% convertible
debenture agreement we will be in default of such obligations, which could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
Our default under these obligations may also limit our ability to obtain future financing from related or third parties, which would
materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy.
Our
management team relies on outside consultants and others in our industry to make informed business decisions; potential conflicts of
interest involving those parties who are relied upon could adversely affect the execution of our business model
Our
management team has relied and will continue to rely on consultants and service providers in our industry. Many of these consultants
or service providers represent or provide services to others in this industry, and no assurance can be given that we, as a small competitor
competing with larger competitors in our industry, will be able to engage these consultants. In addition, our inability to retain such
consultants would negatively affect our ability to identify and evaluate life insurance products for purchase. Even as our management
accumulates expertise in this industry, we will still rely on the expertise of outside consultants for a variety of information, including
valuation, life expectancies, actuarials and other matters specific to life insurance policies. If we cannot obtain such services at
an affordable price, our business will be harmed.
Current
and future federal regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act’s consumer protection provisions may have an adverse effect on our business
and our planned business operations.
On
July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank
Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant changes to the regulation of financial institutions including the creation of new
federal regulatory agencies and the granting of additional authorities and responsibilities to existing regulatory agencies to identify
and address emerging systemic risks posed by the activities of financial services firms. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for enhanced
regulation of derivatives and asset-backed securities offerings, restrictions on executive compensation and enhanced oversight of credit
rating agencies. The provisions include a new independent Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to regulate consumer financial services
and products, and life settlement transactions may be within the scope of its jurisdiction. Actions taken by the Bureau of Consumer Financial
Protection may have material adverse effects on the life settlement industry and could affect the value of insurance policies. In addition,
the Dodd-Frank Act also limits the ability of federal laws to preempt state and local consumer laws. Prospective investors should be
aware that the changes in the regulatory and business landscape as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse impact on us
and the entities from which we may acquire NIBs and similar life settlement products.
10
General
economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business.
Changes
in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, investor sentiment, market and regulatory changes specifically
affecting the insurance industry, competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors
not known to us today, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. There continues to be uncertainty about the
prospects for growth in the U.S. economy as well as economies of other countries, driven by factors such as high current unemployment,
rising government debt levels, prospective Federal Reserve (and similar foreign bodies) policy shifts, the withdrawal of government interventions
in financial markets, changing consumer spending patterns, and changing expectations for inflation and deflation. These factors have
adversely affected the financial markets and the claims-paying ability of many insurers. Such uncertainties and general economic trends
can affect the ability to obtain funds to finance life settlement products. None of these risks are or will be within our control.
The
costs in time and expense of being a publicly-held company are substantial and will only increase if our business model is successful.
We
are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports respecting certain events on Form
8-K, along with proxy or information statements for any meeting of stockholders or written consents of stockholders holding sufficient
securities to effect corporate actions. Most of these reports require generating and compiling significant accounting, legal and financial
information, including audited year-end financial statements and reviewed quarterly financial statements. The preparation of these reports,
their review by management and professionals and the auditing and review process of such financial statements consumes significant resources,
in terms of management time and focus, as well as expenses related to legal, accounting and audit fees. It is difficult to quantify these
costs, but we believe them to be not less than between approximately $175,000 and $250,000 annually. As our business grows, these costs
can only increase.
We
are new to the bond, life settlement, and financial advisory industry and may not be able to successfully compete in this industry.
We
only recently began providing advisory services relating to bond issuances and life settlement transactions. In order for these operations
to be successful, we will need to develop sufficient expertise and establish relationships with clients. Identifying and acquiring clients
in this industry will require us to compete with other larger, more experienced, and better capitalized service providers and we may
not be successful in developing such client relationships. If we are not able to successful market our advisory business, our financial
condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
Historically,
99% of our total assets are interests in life settlement policies, resulting in a lack of diversification of assets and concentration
in assets that are subject to significant fluctuations in value.
Although
we currently have no ownership in life settlement policies, generally speaking, our previous investment in NIBs was usually the primary
asset on our balance sheet. Life settlement products like NIBs are subject to substantial fluctuations in value, primarily based upon
matters that are not within our control, such as the current health and life expectancy of the insureds underlying our NIBs, the solvency
of the Holders of the policies and the Holders’ Lender, the Holders’ financing costs and ability to acquire policies and
the solvency of the insurance companies. Each of these factors can result in significant fluctuations of the value of the life insurance
policies underlying the NIBs, thereby affecting potential future interests.
Limitations
to the financial model we use may result in inaccurate or incomplete projections of future cash flow from the insurance policies.
The
financial model we utilized to project future cash flows from potential life settlement assets was chosen because of its straight-forward
approach in calculating expected cash flows. We believe the methodology used in the model is particularly desirable because it has parameters
that are easily verifiable and does not require complex calculations or mathematical simulations to confirm results. However, with every
financial model, there are limitations. Most require assumptions to be made. Our model is no exception. Our assumptions may prove to
be incorrect and, therefore, our model may be incorrect. Our model relies on actuarial life-expectancy reports prepared by third parties
from which the estimated date of maturity is calculated. It is assumed that these reports were accurately made and properly reflect real
life expectancies. Our model also requires other inputs including but not limited to the following: (i) a 15-year period for projections;
(ii) a distinct number of lives; (iii) a distinct number of policies; (iv) life expectancy tables and projections; (v) premiums; (vi)
senior lending fees; (vii) MRI fees; and (viii) insurance, servicing and custodial fees. While this method of modeling cash flows is
helpful in setting general expectations of potential returns that might be produced from a given portfolio, there is no way such results
can be guaranteed. In addition to our assumptions, there are many factors that may affect the selection of inputs for the model.
11
The
individuals insured by the life insurance policies may live longer than their actuarial life expectancies and thereby, cash flows from
life insurance policies may be delayed.
The
actual date of death of an insured with respect to a life insurance policy is uncertain. Life expectancies are projected from the medical
records of the insured and actuarial data based upon the historical experience of similarly situated persons. However, it is impossible
to predict with certainty any insured’s life expectancy. We have and will continue to base our longevity assumptions on the reports
of third-party life expectancy providers, among whom there is no uniformity of assumptions, approach or procedure. There are also significant
disputes among third-party life expectancy providers regarding the mortality rate relating to certain disease states and the efficacy
of certain treatments. Some factors that may affect the accuracy of a life expectancy report or other calculation of the estimated length
of an individual’s life are:
●
the
experience and qualifications of the medical professional or life expectancy company providing the life expectancy estimate;
●
the
completeness and accuracy of medical records received by the life expectancy company;
●
the
reliability of, and revisions to, actuarial tables or other mortality data published by public and private organizations or developed
by a life expectancy company and utilized by its medical professionals;
●
the
nature of any illness or health conditions of the insured disclosed or undisclosed;
●
changes
in living habits and lifestyle of an insured and medical treatments, medications and therapies available to and used by an insured;
and
●
future
improvements in medical treatments and cures, and the quality of medical care the insured receives.
We
rely primarily on various different life expectancy providers. A life expectancy (“LE”), can be considered the life expectancy
provider’s “best estimate” as to how long a person would live. We assume that the life expectancies were accurately
calculated and properly assessed for purposes of our model. To introduce some “checks and balances” into our cash flow projections,
we use at least two LE reports from different third-party LE providers for each policy. We do this to try to avoid any systemic bias
introduced by dependency on life expectancies produced by a single source. In addition, our model gives greater weight to the longer
(and more conservative) of the two LEs. By using such a long/short weighted average, our model attempts to hedge against unexpected longevities
in a portfolio.
Changes
in actuarial based life expectancy methodologies (which are determined by the Society of Actuaries and are amended every three to five
years) could have the effect of reducing the internal rate of return on the life insurance policies and could cause increased difficulty
in financing premiums. If changes are significant, they could lower prices for life insurance policies, but could also lower the value
of the life insurance policies due to the lower resulting present value of the death benefits forecasted to be paid at later dates. Holders’
senior loans require that certain loan to value ratios be maintained and decreases in policy values could result in violations of these
provisions. Default by Holders on their senior loans may impair their ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain the life insurance
policies.
In
addition, because our cash flow is usually dependent on life insurance policies coming to maturity, if life expectancies prove wrong
cash flows will change. If the insured lives longer than any or all of the life expectancy appraisals predict, then the amounts available
to life settlement interests could be diminished, perhaps significantly, due to the additional time during which premiums will have to
be paid and financing and other related expenses incurred in order to keep the related policy in force. If the insureds with respect
to too many life insurance policies live longer than their respective life expectancies, then Holders may have to liquidate such life
insurance policies. The market value of such Policies will necessarily be significantly less than the related death benefits.
12
Having
relatively few insureds could cause the overall performance to be unduly influenced by a relatively small number of underlying policies
that perform better or worse than expected.
Our
life expectancy actuarial results related to smaller portfolios may not be as reliable as they would be if the underlying portfolios
were larger. We understand that Standard & Poor’s has stated that at least 1,000 lives are required to achieve actuarial stability,
while A.M. Best concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary. Having fewer lives in a policy portfolio can cause the overall performance
of such portfolio to be unduly influenced by a relatively small number of “outliers” where the assets perform better or worse
than expected. The industry has sought to mitigate this risk by obtaining MRI coverage, which has the effect of accelerating cash flows
in cases where the assets underperform and reducing the volatility normally associated with a portfolio with fewer lives.
Increased
general market interests rates could increase the carrying costs of the life insurance policies and reduce the related cash flows.
If
general market interest rates increase, the value of life insurance portfolios would likely decrease. Some of the Holder’s carrying
costs associated with the life insurance policy portfolios (specifically interest payments on the MRI coverage outstanding balance) are
tied to interest rates. If interest rates increase, the Holder’s carrying costs will increase and the return on our investment
will decrease. Because the Holders pay all of the costs associated with the life insurance policy portfolios, an increase in the Holder’s
carrying costs will correspondingly decrease the amount of cash flows.
In
addition, if the interest rates used to determine the market value of a life insurance policy change, the present value of the policy
may also change. Generally, as interest rates increase, the present value of a life insurance policy decreases. If a Holder is forced
to sell a policy in a higher interest rate environment, the market price for the policies may be less than the price at which such policy
was acquired. Furthermore, Holders are generally obligated under the senior loans financing the purchase of life insurance policies to
maintain certain loan to value ratios. If the present value of the life insurance policies decreases significantly, the Holder may be
in breach of such obligations, which could impair the Holder’s ability to obtain financing necessary to service existing life insurance
policies or acquire new policies. As a result, any life insurance portfolios may decline in value or become worthless.
Changes
to foreign banking laws and regulations or decreased lending capacity for life settlements could have a negative impact on the ability
of Holders to obtain loans with respect to purchases of life settlements.
Our
current business model relies on the availability to the Holders of senior loans from the Holders’ Lender or any other lender.
In the event of adverse regulatory changes or reduced capacity for life settlement lending, the Holders could experience the same liquidity
issues that have plagued other market participants. Changes to the Holders’ Lender’s loan to value requirements, compliance
with regulatory large exposure limits and changes to regulatory large exposure limits could also result in liquidity issues for the Holders
and corresponding liquidity issues for us. As mentioned above, changes in life expectancies could cause decreases in policy values, which
could result in loan to value violations and violations of large exposure limits.
Holders
may be required to obtain MRI coverage as a condition of our business model, which, if unavailable, could potentially increase our risk
of failure.
The
MRI is a relatively new product and there are no guarantees that the MRI provider will be able to meet the Holders’ coverage needs.
In addition, it is our understanding that there is only one MRI provider. The MRI provider has refused to provide future coverage to
the Holders. Without the MRI coverage, the Holders have limited options when the senior loans mature. The Holders’ Lender has demanded
repayment of all outstanding amounts under the senior loans.
13
The
lapse of life insurance policies will result in the entire loss of our interest in the death benefits from those particular policies.
The
Holders are required to make premium payments on the life insurance policies in order to keep such policies in force. These payments
generally will be made from amounts available to the Holders pursuant to the senior loans, death benefits, and MRI payments, if available.
Actual
results from life settlement products may not match expected results, which could reduce returns and also adversely affect the ability
to service and grow a portfolio for actuarial stability.
Our
business model relies on achieving actual results similar to those projected by using actuarial estimates. We believe that the larger
the portfolio of policies, the more reliable actuarial estimates will be and, likewise, the greater the likelihood that expected results
will be achieved.
In
a study published in 2012, A.M. Best concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to narrow the band of cash flow volatility and achieve
actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor’s has indicated that actuarial stability is unlikely to be achieved with a pool
of less than 1,000 lives. While there is a risk with a portfolio of any size that actual yield may be less than expected, we believe
that the risk we face is presently more significant given the relatively low number of insureds underlying our potential NIBs as compared
to rating agency recommendations. Even if our portfolio reaches a size that is actuarially stable according to the rating agencies, we
still may experience differences between the actuarial models we use and actual mortalities. Differences between our expectations and
actuarial models, and actual mortality results, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In such
a case, we would face liquidity problems, including difficulties acquiring new NIBs and other life settlement products. Continued or
material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors,
thereby making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed to acquire additional NIBs and obtain desired diversification and expansion
of the underlying insureds.
The
limited number of sellers of life settlement products in the secondary market may limit the ability to negotiate favorable prices in
the acquisition of such life settlement interests.
Because
we are not currently licensed to purchase life insurance policies directly from the insureds, we rely on re-sellers like Del Mar, PCH
and HFII for such products.
Unless
other sources become available, the ability to purchase the life settlement products desired may be limited. In addition, the limited
number of sellers could limit the ability to negotiate favorable prices to purchase life settlement products, which could reduce profitability.
Furthermore, recent declines in the secondary market for life settlements have limited the availability of pools of life insurance policies,
resulting in increased price competition.
We
do not track concentrations of pre-existing medical conditions of insureds in our guidelines for purchasing life settlement products.
Concentrations
of pre-existing medical conditions in insureds could affect the valuation of the portfolios that such policies underlie. We do not track
concentrations of pre-existing medical conditions in purchases of life settlement products. Thus, the valuation of such interests and
our estimates of cash flows therefrom could be inaccurate.
If
life settlement products are determined to be “securities,” Holders may be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, which would substantially increase SEC reporting costs and oversight of a Holder’s business operations.
On
July 22, 2010, the SEC released a Staff Report by the Life Settlements Task Force that recommended the SEC consider recommending to Congress
that it amend the definition of “security” under the federal securities laws to include life settlement policies as securities.
One U.S. Congressman has sought to introduce a bill to make such amendment. While that attempt did not result in any action, there can
be no assurance that such a bill will not be passed at some future date. If federal securities laws are indeed amended to include such
policies within the definition of “security,” or if courts with relevant jurisdiction interpret existing securities laws
to that effect, our ability to operate our business under our current business model may be constrained by additional regulatory requirements
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act.
14
Such
requirements could, among other things, limit our or Holder’s ability to change investment policies without stockholder approval,
prohibit our acquisition of assets from an affiliate without SEC approval, limit leveraging of our assets to one-third of our total asset
value, require accounting for all derivatives as a leverage of assets to the extent that they create an obligation on our part to pay
out assets to a counterparty ahead of our stockholders and generally require 40% of our directors to be independent directors. In addition,
intermediaries used to purchase life settlement products may be required to register as broker-dealers or registered investment advisers
and would otherwise be subject to oversight by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which require adherence to numerous
rules and regulations. Such regulations could substantially increase our compliance and reporting costs, which would negatively affect
profitability.
There
is poor liquidity in the secondary market for life insurance and life settlements.
The
secondary market for life insurance policies and life settlements is relatively illiquid, and it is often difficult to sell life insurance
policies or interests in life insurance policies at attractive prices, if at all. The ability to sell life insurance policies may be
made even more difficult due to the nature in which the policies were originated, especially with respect to policies where the premiums
were financed by the original owner, creating an increased risk associated with holding such policies. Holders may be limited in their
ability to liquidate assets if they need to do so in order to raise funds to pay premiums, or otherwise.
Life
settlements, and therefore our common stock, are highly speculative and may lose all of their value.
Life
settlements are highly speculative investments. With respect to life insurance policies, it is not possible to determine in advance either
the exact time that a life insurance policy will reach maturity (i.e., at the death of the insured) or the profit, loss or return on
an investment in a life insurance policy. The longer the period between the purchase of a life settlement and the payout on the underlying
policy at maturity, the lower return will be because of the cost to maintain the underlying policies.
In
addition, no assurance can be given that any life insurance policy will perform in accordance with projections, and any such life insurance
policy may decline in value. Consequently, there can be no assurance that, to the extent we invest in NIBs, we will realize a positive
return on our investment. These types of investments should be considered to be highly speculative in nature. This, in turn, may directly
affect the amount and timing of funding sought or received by us, which in turn will affect our ability to conduct our business. Thus,
an investment in our Company is suitable only for investors having substantial financial resources, a clear understanding of the risk
factors associated with such investments and the ability to withstand the potential loss of their entire investment.
Risks
Related to the Life Insurance Policies
Policies
may be determined to have been issued without an “insurable interest” and could be void or voidable.
State
insurance laws in the United States require that an insurance policy may only be initially procured by a person that has an insurable
interest in the continuance of the life of the insured. Whether an owner has an insurable interest in the insured is a question of applicable
state law. The general concept is that a person with an insurable interest is a person that has a continuing interest in the insured
remaining alive, whether through the bonds of love and affection or due to certain recognized economic relationships. Typically this
includes the insured, the insured’s spouse and children, and in some states, other close relatives. In some jurisdictions, however,
this could also include entities such as the insured’s creditors, employer, business partners or certain charitable institutions.
It also typically includes a trust that owns a life insurance policy insuring the life of the grantor or settlor of the trust where the
beneficiaries of the trust are persons, who, by virtue of certain familial relationships with the grantor or settlor, also have an insurable
interest in the life of the insured.
15
A
policy purchased by a person without an insurable interest may, depending on relevant state insurance law, be (i) void, (ii) voidable
by the insurer that issued the policy and/or (iii) subject to the claims of the insured’s presumptive beneficiaries, such as his
or her spouse or other family members. In some states, the insured must consent to the purchase of a policy by a person other than the
insured.
Generally,
state insurance law is clear that an individual has an insurable interest in his or her own life and may procure life insurance on his
or her own life and may name any person as beneficiary. However, if a person purchases insurance on his or her own life for the benefit
of a party who does not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured for the purpose of evading the insurable interest laws,
the purchase may be viewed under applicable state law as a violation of the state’s insurable interest laws. Should the issuer
own an interest in a policy that was originally issued to an owner or for the benefit of a beneficiary (if required) that did not have
an insurable interest, it is possible that the issuer may not have a valid claim for the death benefits on such policy, and upon the
death of the insured, the issuing insurance company may refuse to pay the death benefits on the policy to us or may be required to pay
the death benefit to other beneficiaries of the insured. Should any such claims be successful in relation to the policies underlying
NIBs, we could lose some or all the amounts we have invested in NIBs, although in some states the issuing insurance company may be required
to repay the premiums if it rescinds the policy. Some states, such as New Jersey, allow the carrier to retain all the premiums in the
event the policy is rescinded, and some states, such as Delaware, require premiums to be returned in cases where the policy is successfully
challenged by the carrier. Even if such claims are unsuccessful, significant amounts may need to be expended in defending such claims,
thereby reducing the amounts we may receive from NIBs and other life settlement interests we may purchase.
Concern
also exists regarding the applicability of state insurable interest requirements applicable to the purchase of a policy by an insured
or a person with an insurable interest in the life of the insured in circumstances in which the owner of the policy obtains a loan secured
by the policy to finance the payment of premiums on the policy, often referred to as a premium finance transaction. A substantial number
of the life insurance policies underlying NIBs have been originated pursuant to premium finance transactions. While it is generally accepted
by state law that an individual has an insurable interest in his or her own life, it is possible that a court might construe a premium
finance transaction as an attempt to evade the requirement that an insurable interest exist at the time an insurance policy is issued.
If the borrower in such a transaction is found to be acting, in fact, on behalf of a premium finance company to procure an insurance
policy, it is possible that a court might find that the real party in interest is the premium finance company, which by itself would
not have an insurable interest sufficient to support the insurance policy. As a result, the insurance policy may be void or subject to
attack, which could diminish the value of the policy. States have varying precedent on this subject. California, New York and Florida
have case law that is very favorable to the policy owner (see Lincoln v. Jack Teren and Jonathan S. Berck, as trustee of the
Jack Teren Insurance Trust (Superior Court of the State of California, San Diego), Alice Kramer v. Lockwood Pension Services,
Inc., et al., (United States District Court – Southern District of New York)). These courts have held life insurance policies
to be enforceable even where the policies were clearly purchased with an intent to sell the policies in the future. Florida has case
law that is also favorable (see PrucoLife Insurance Company v. Wells Fargo (Florida Supreme Court, which held that a policy
may not be contested after the expiration of the policy’s contestability period). Delaware has laws which benefit the insurance
carrier and others that are more favorable to the policy owner (see PHL Variable Insurance Co. vs. Price Dawe, (Supreme
Court of Delaware) and Principal Life Insurance Company v. Lawrence Rucker 2007 Insurance Trust (District Court of Delaware)).
These courts have invalidated policies where the original policy owners financed the policies and did not intend to purchase the policies
with their own money and further intended to ultimately sell the policies in the life settlement markets. However, the Rucker case did
provide that premium financing could qualify as an insured procuring a policy and satisfy requirements related to insurable interest.
There is also legislation in most states regulating premium financing that must be complied with for policies originated after the legislation
was enacted.
Also,
in every state that has addressed the question other than New York and Michigan, the expiration of an insurance policy’s contestability
period may not cut off the insurer’s ability to raise the insurable interest issue as a defense to the payment of the policy proceeds.
One
or more states could adopt legislation that would require a holder of an insurance policy to have an insurable interest in the insured
at the time a policy is purchased and at the time of death of the insured. Neither us nor the Holders will have an insurable interest
in the insureds polices acquired by or on our behalf. If such legislation were to be adopted without a ‘grandfathering’ provision
(i.e., so as not to be applicable to insurance policies then in force), then we may be unable to collect the proceeds on the death benefits
of the insured persons under our NIBs purchased prior to the enactment of such legislation and our NIBs would be worthless.
16
Additional
insurable interest concerns regarding life insurance policies originated pursuant to premium finance transactions may also result in
adverse decisions that could effect policies.
The
legality and merit of “investor-initiated” or “stranger-originated” life insurance products have been questioned
by members of the insurance industry, including by many life insurance companies and insurance regulators. For example, the New York
Department of Insurance issued a General Counsel’s opinion in 2005 concluding that a premium finance program that was coupled with
the right of the policy owner to put the financed insurance policy to a third party violated New York’s insurable interest statute
and may also constitute a violation of New York State’s prohibition against premium rebates/free insurance. More recently, many
states have enacted laws expressly defining and prohibiting stranger-originated life insurance (“STOLI”) practices, which
in general involve the issuance of life insurance policies as part of or in connection with a practice or plan to initiate life insurance
policies for the benefit of a third-party investor who, at the time of the policy issuance, lacks a valid insurable interest in the life
of the insured. Under these laws, certain premium finance loan structures are treated as life settlements and, accordingly, may not be
entered into at the time of policy issuance and for a two or five-year period, thereafter, depending on the state. Certain court decisions
over the past few years may also increase concerns with premium-financed policies. In 2011, the Delaware Supreme Court stated in PHL
Variable Insurance Company v. Price Dawe 2006 Insurance Trust that the key focus in insurable interest cases is who paid the premiums.
While the decision was not issued in connection with a premium financed policy, investors were concerned with how the court would apply
such reasoning to premium financed policies. This concern was alleviated in the 2012 Delaware District Court case of Principal Life
Insurance Company v. Lawrence Rucker 2007 Insurance Trust that concluded that “an insured’s ability to procure a policy
is not limited to paying the premiums with his own funds; borrowing money with an obligation to repay would also qualify as an insured
procuring a policy.”
We
cannot predict whether a state regulator, insurance carrier or other party will assert that any policies should be treated as having
been issued as part of a STOLI transaction or otherwise were issued in contravention of applicable insurable interest laws. This risk
is greater where the insured materially misstated his or her income and/or net worth in the life insurance application. Decisions in
Florida have increased the risk that challenges to premium financed policies may be decided in favor of the issuing insurance company.
Moreover, because the life insurance policies are often originated in the same or a similar manner and in a limited number of states
(generally, California and Wisconsin, although the insured may reside in other states), there is a heightened risk that an adverse court
decision or other challenge or determination by a regulatory or other interested party with respect to a policy could have a material
adverse effect on a significant number of other policies, including the rescission of policies or the occurrence of other actions that
prevent us from being entitled to receive or retain the net death benefit related to the policies. Concerns of such nature could also
negatively affect the market value and/or liquidity of the life insurance policies.
Fraud
in the application for life insurance can also affect assets and interest in policies.
There
are risks that policies may be procured based on fraud or misrepresentation in connection with the application for the policy. Types
of fraud that have enabled carriers to rescind or void the related policies successfully include, among others, misrepresentations concerning
an insured’s financial net worth and/or income, need for and purpose of the life insurance protection, medical history and current
physical condition, including age and whether the insured is a smoker. Such risk of fraud and misrepresentation is heightened in connection
with life insurance policies for which the premiums are financed through premium finance loans or other structured programs. In particular,
there is a significant risk that applicants and potential insureds may not answer truthfully or completely questions related to whether
the life insurance policy premiums will be financed through a premium finance loan or otherwise, the applicants’ purpose for purchasing
the policy or the applicants’ intention regarding the future sale or transfer of the life insurance policy. Such risk may be further
increased to the extent life insurance agents communicate to applicants and potential insureds regarding potential premium finance arrangements
or profits to be made on policies that will be sold after the contestability period. If an insured has made any material misrepresentation
on his/her application for life insurance, there is a heightened risk that the insurance company will contest or successfully rescind
or void the related policy, although an issuing insurance company may not be able to raise such claims after the expiration of the contestability
period. There has been significant litigation regarding whether or not a policy can be contested for fraud after the expiration of the
contestability period. Florida, California and New York have concluded that a carrier may not contest a policy after the contestability
period. New Jersey and Delaware have allowed such contests by the carriers. Even if such fraud in the application could not serve as
a basis to challenge a policy because the contestability period has expired, it may be raised as evidence that the policy was provided
as part of a STOLI arrangement. Furthermore, such misrepresentations can adversely affect the actuarial value of the death benefit under
the related life insurance policies.
17
The
risk of litigation with issuing insurance companies could substantially raise our costs of operation and increase our risk of loss.
Some
of the programs relating to the premium finance transactions through which certain underlying insurance policies are originated, or other
programs having similar characteristics, may be objectionable to certain life insurance companies and other parties, including certain
regulators, on the basis of constituting a means of originating stranger-originated life insurance. Additionally, as described above,
life insurance policies that are originated through the use of premium finance programs often present a greater risk of there having
been fraud and/or misrepresentations in connection with the issuance of the policies. For these reasons, among others, it is possible
that holders may become subject to, or may otherwise become affected by, litigation involving one or more issuing insurance companies
(either as a plaintiff or a defendant), including claims by an issuing insurance company seeking to rescind a policy prior to or after
the death of the related insured. Moreover, such risk may be enhanced with respect to an issuing insurance company that is experiencing
financial difficulty, since a successful claim by an issuing insurance company could reduce its financial liabilities. In the event any
litigation involving the policy holder was to occur, the policy holder would bear the costs of such litigation, and would be unable to
predict its outcome, which could include losing the right to receive (or retain) the proceeds otherwise payable under one or more of
the underlying policies.
The
contestation of the life insurance policies by the applicable issuing insurance companies could result in the loss of the benefits from
such life insurance policies.
The
ability of an issuing insurance company to seek to rescind one or more life insurance policies depends on whether such issuing insurance
company is barred from bringing a rescission action by operation of an incontestability clause contained in the life insurance policies
or contestability limitations applicable as a matter of state law. Each life insurance policy, in accordance with laws adopted in virtually
every state in the United States, contains a provision that provides that, absent a failure to pay premiums, a policy shall be incontestable
after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of not more than two years after its date of issue. However,
as stated above, some states recognize an exception to incontestability where there was actual fraud in the procurement of the policy.
A new contestability period may also arise in connection with information provided on any application for reinstatement of a life insurance
policy following lapse of a policy due to non-payment of premiums, or an application for an increase in policy benefits. The successful
contestation of the life insurance policies by the applicable issuing insurance companies could materially and adversely affect cash
flows.
Increases
in cost of insurance could reduce estimated returns and lower revenues.
Insurers
pass on a portion of their expenses to operate their business and administer their life insurance policies in the form of policy charges
borne by each policyholder. In the event an insurer experiences significantly higher than anticipated expenses associated with operation
and/or policy administration, the insurer has the right to increase the charges to each of its policy owners. In the event the charges
to a life insurance policy are materially increased, additional premium payments may be required to maintain enforceability of such policy.
AXA
Equitable issued cost-of-insurance, referred to herein as “COI,” increases on eleven (11) of the previously held life insurance
policies underlying our prior NIBs. In addition, one Transamerica and one Lincoln policy, both of which were Policies underlying our
prior NIBs, were subject to increased COI’s. Other carriers have been issuing COI increases that impact life insurance policies
held by large settlement funds. Multiple lawsuits, including class actions, against Phoenix Life, Lincoln National Insurance Company,
AXA Equitable, Banner Life, and Transamerica Life Insurance Company are currently ongoing. However, most of these lawsuits are in the
very early stages.
Carrier
and service partner credit risk can adversely affect life settlements.
Holders
are subject to the credit risk associated with the viability of the various insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies.
The insolvency of an issuing insurance company or a downgrade in the ratings of an issuing insurance company could have a material adverse
impact on the value of a policy issued by such issuing insurance company, as the collectability of the related death benefits and the
ability of such issuing insurance company to pay the cash surrender value or other amounts agreed to be paid by the issuing insurance
company may be reduced. Any such impairment of the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company could materially and adversely
affect the value of the policies issued by such insurance company, the ability of the Holder to pay the premiums due on other insurance
policies and the Holders ability to pay any required policy premiums, fees and expenses of the service providers and our other expenses,
which could materially and adversely affect the value of a policy.
18
The
inability to keep track of the insureds could keep us from updating the medical records of the insured.
It
is important for the Holder of the life insurance policies to track the health status of an insured and keep information current, which
is done by contacting the insured and/or other designated persons and obtaining updated medical records from an insured’s physician.
There are significant U.S. federal and state laws relating to privacy of personal information that affect the operations of the servicer
and its ability to properly service the policies, especially with regard to obtaining current information from an insured’s physician.
Under
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA, the federal law that governs the release of medical records from medical
record custodians, an insured may revoke his or her authorization for previously authorized third parties to receive medical records
at any time, leaving the Holder unable to receive additional medical records.
The
Holder may have to rely on a third-party servicer to track an insured, especially if states continue to adopt laws that would limit the
ability of a person other than a licensed life settlement provider or its authorized representative to contact insureds for tracking
purposes and the servicer may lose contact with such insured. For example, the insured may move and not notify the servicer or any other
third party that has authority to contact the insured. The servicer attempts to maintain contact information for the insured and/or one
or more close family friends or relatives whenever possible so it can maintain contact with the insured. Additionally, the servicer subscribes
to various databases that use public records and other information to track individuals. The servicer also subscribes to death notification
services which use Social Security and public records information to notify the servicer if an insured has passed away so that it can
begin the process of obtaining a death certificate and arranging for the payout of the policy. Changes to the Social Security Administration’s
Death Master File have resulted in the elimination of many state records that were previously included in the Death Master File. The
number of new records being added to the Death Master File has been reduced by approximately 40%. Thus, it has become necessary to enhance
alternative methods for learning of an insured’s death. On average, it now takes longer to learn about an insured’s death
as compared to periods prior to the changes in the Death Master File.
Despite
these various tracking methods, it is still possible for the Holder to lose contact with an insured, making any additional updates of
the insured’s medical condition impossible. There can also be no assurance that the Holder will learn of an insured’s death
on a timely basis. Delays in receiving insurance proceeds result in a decrease in the death benefit.
Lost
insureds can result in a delay or a loss of an insurance benefit that would have a negative effect on revenues and prospects.
Occasionally,
the issuing insurance company may encounter (or assert) situations where the body of the insured or reasonable other evidence of death
cannot be located and/or identified. For example, the insured may have been lost at sea and there may not be proof of death available
for several years or at all. Alternatively, the fact that the original beneficiaries no longer have any financial interest in a claim
under the policy may mean that the issuing insurance company faces practical obstructions to recording accurately and in a timely manner
the death of the insured. In the event of a “lost” insured, the death claim may be delayed for up to seven years by the issuing
insurance company. Under these circumstances, typically, the claim will then be paid with interest from the date that the insured was
originally presumed lost. Nonetheless, it remains possible that it will be difficult or impossible to locate and/or identify an insured
to establish proof of death and, as a result, the related issuing insurance company may significantly delay (but not ultimately avoid)
payment of the underlying death benefit. This delay could result in a longer than anticipated holding period for a policy which, in turn,
could result in a loss.
The
death of an insured must have occurred to permit the servicer to file a claim with the issuing insurance company for the death benefit.
Obtaining actual knowledge of death of an insured, as discussed above, may prove difficult and time-consuming due to the need to comply
with applicable law regarding the contacting of the insured’s family to ascertain the fact of death and to obtain a copy of the
death certificate or other necessary documents in order to file the claim. The death benefit typically increases subsequent to death
by an interest rate that is less than the interest rate under the senior loan; thus, the policy proceeds become less valuable as time
passes.
19
U.S.
life settlement and viatical regulations may result in determination(s) of applicable law violations.
The
purchase and sale of insurance policies in the secondary market from the policy’s original owner and among secondary market participants
is subject to regulation in approximately 45 states and Puerto Rico. The scope of the regulations and the consequences of their violation
vary from state to state. In addition, within a given state, the regulations may vary based upon the life expectancy of the insured at
the time of sale or purchase. In many states, a policy on an insured with a life expectancy of two years or less is referred to as a
“viatical settlement” or a “viatical.” A policy on an insured with a life expectancy of more than two years is
referred to as a “life settlement.” The Holders have not, and do not intend to, purchase viatical settlements and should
not be subject to the regulatory regimes that govern these policies. However, the states vary in their technical definitions of viatical
settlements and life settlements, and state insurance regulators, who are charged with interpretation and administration of insurance
laws and regulations, vary in their interpretations. Therefore, despite expectations, it may be possible that under the rules of a particular
state, a policy that is not commonly thought of as a viatical settlement may meet the technical definition thereof. Engaging in the purchase
or sale of life settlements or viatical settlements in violation of applicable regulatory regimes could result in fines, administrative
and civil sanctions and, in some instances, criminal sanctions. United States and state securities laws could have an adverse effect
on the Holders’ ability to liquidate any policies we or they believe should be sold.
It
is possible that, depending on the facts and circumstances attending a particular sale of a life insurance policy, a sale could implicate
state and federal securities laws. The failure to comply with applicable securities laws in connection with dealings in life settlement
transactions could result in fines, administrative and civil sanctions and, in some instances, criminal sanctions. In addition, parties
may be entitled to a remedy of rescission regarding such transactions. State guaranteed funds give some protection for payments under
life insurance policies, but no assurance can be given that we will benefit from them.
State
protections for the insolvency of an insurance company are limited.
With
respect to the life insurance policies, the payment of death benefits by issuing insurance companies is supported by state regulated
reserves held by the issuing insurance companies and, under certain circumstances and in limited amounts that vary from state to state,
state-supported life and health insurance guaranty associations or funds. However, such reserves and guaranty funds, to the extent in
existence, may be insufficient to pay all death benefits under the life insurance policies issued by an issuing insurance company if
such issuing insurance company becomes insolvent. Even if such guaranty funds are sufficient, the obligation of a state guaranty fund
to make payments may not be triggered in certain circumstances.
The
benefits of most or all of such state supported guaranty funds are capped per insured life (irrespective of the number of policies issued
and outstanding on the life of such individual), which caps are generally less than the net death benefits of the insurance policies.
Guaranty fund laws often include aggregate limits payable with respect to any one life across different types of insurance policies,
generally $300,000 to $500,000 depending on the state. Most state guaranty funds are statutorily created and the legislatures may amend
or repeal the laws that govern them. In addition, most state guaranty fund laws were enacted with the stated goal of assisting policy
holders resident in such states. Therefore, non-resident policyholders, beneficiaries, and claimants may not be covered or may be covered
only in limited circumstances. As a result, state guaranty funds will likely provide little protection to us in the event of the insolvency
of an issuing insurance company. In addition, in the event of an issuing insurance company’s insolvency, courts and receivers may
impose moratoriums or delays on payments of cash surrender values and/or death benefits.
Liability
for failing to comply with U.S. privacy safeguards.
Both
federal and state statutes safeguard an insured’s private health information. In addition, insureds frequently have an expectation
of confidentiality even if they are not legally entitled to it. If any of the entities providing services related to the life insurance
policies properly obtains and uses otherwise private health information, but fails to maintain the confidentiality of such information,
such service provider may receive complaints from the affected individuals, their families and relatives and, potentially, interested
regulatory authorities. Because of the uncertainty of applicable law, it is not possible to predict the outcome of such disputes.
20
Additionally,
it is possible that, due to a misunderstanding regarding the scope of consents that a service provider possesses, such service provider
may request and receive from health care providers information that it in fact did not have a right to request or receive. Once again,
if a service provider receives complaints for these acts, it is not possible to predict what the results will be. This uncertainty also
increases the likelihood that a service provider may sell, or cause to be sold, life insurance policies in violation of applicable law,
which could potentially result in additional costs related to defending claims or enduring regulatory inquiries, rescinding such transactions,
possible legal damages and penalties and probable reduced market value of the affected life insurance policies. Each of the foregoing
factors may delay or reduce the return on life insurance policies.
Cyber-attacks
or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In
the normal course of business, we may have access to sensitive and confidential information regarding insureds. Although we devote significant
resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs,
our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts
of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events.
Information
security risks have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies
(including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized
crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft
of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks designed to disrupt key business services, such as
customer-facing websites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these
types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We
employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by
sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.
The
access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding the insureds could result
in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our business,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
U.S.
privacy concerns may affect the access to accurate and current medical information regarding the insured under life insurance policies.
The
value of a life insurance policy is inherently tied to the remaining life expectancy of the insured and information necessary to perform
this valuation may not be available at the time of purchase or sale. For example, if a policy is being purchased in the secondary market
from an entity that had earlier purchased the policy directly from the insured, it is likely that the insured made his or her medical
records available at the time of his or her sale of the policy to the initial purchaser. However, if necessary consents were not obtained
from the insured, it is possible that this information cannot legally be made available at the time of the subsequent purchase of the
policy. If it is legally available to the subsequent purchaser, it is possible that such information is outdated and of little utility
for a current evaluation of the remaining life expectancy of the insured. Even if the insured granted a general consent that gave the
owner of the policy the right to subsequently request and receive medical information from the insured’s health providers, it is
possible for the insured to subsequently revoked such consent. Likewise, it is possible that, under applicable law, the consent expires
after a certain period of time. Even if the consent is effective, without the cooperation of the insured, it may be difficult to convince
the insured’s health care providers of the consent’s efficacy and such health providers may be reluctant to release medical
information. These impediments to accessing current medical information can prove to be a significant obstacle to the proper valuation
of a policy at the time of either the policy’s purchase or sale.
21
Risk
Factors Related To Our Common Stock
There
is a limited public market for our common stock, and any market that may develop could be volatile.
The
market for our common stock has been limited due to, among other factors, low public float of our common stock, low trading volume and
the small number of brokerage firms acting as market makers. There were 18,741,922  shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates
as of March 31, 2025. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a
result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume
of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.
In addition, because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general
or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. The average daily trading volume for our stock has varied significantly
from week to week and from month to month, and the trading volume often varies widely from day to day. Because of the limitations of
our market and volatility of the market price of our stock, investors may face difficulties in selling shares at attractive prices when
they want to.
An
active trading market for shares of our common stock may never develop or be sustained. If no trading market develops, securities analysts
may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company, which could further depress the demand for our common stock. As a result,
investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock when they want to sell. The limited market for our shares may also impair
our ability to raise capital by selling additional shares and our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common
stock as consideration. The following may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the trading price of our shares, among
other factors:
●
Conditions
and publicity regarding the life settlement market and related regulations generally;
●
Regulatory
developments in the life settlement market;
●
Lack
of listing for our common stock;
●
Lack
of shares of our common stock in public float;
●
Lack
of market makers with respect to our common stock;
●
Inability
to raise needed capital;
●
Low
volume of trading of our common stock;
●
Price
and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large, which do not relate to our operating performance; and
●
Comments
by securities analysts or government officials, including those with regard to the viability or profitability of the life settlement
industry generally or with regard to our ability to meet market expectations.
The
stock market has occasionally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to particular companies’ operating performance.
We
are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies
will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We
are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to
be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation
and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other
public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and
our stock price may be more volatile.
22
We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock
that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (2) the end of the fiscal year in which
we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion or more during such fiscal year, (3) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion
in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (4) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first
sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Decreased disclosures in our
SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of
operations and financial prospects.
Our
management and two stockholders beneficially own approximately 65% of our outstanding common stock and therefore can exert control over
our business.
Members
of our management team and three stockholders together beneficially own approximately 65% of our outstanding common stock. This percentage
of stock ownership is significant in that it could carry any vote on any matter requiring stockholder approval, including the subsequent
election of directors, who in turn appoint all officers. As a result, these persons control the Company, regardless of the vote of other
stockholders. As a result, other stockholders may not have an effective voice in our affairs.
Future
sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital in the future, resulting in our inability
to raise required funding for our operations.
Sales
of substantial amounts of our common stock could harm the market price of our common stock. This also could harm our ability to raise
capital in the future. Of the 43,063,441  shares of our common stock that were outstanding as of March 31, 2025, 225,000 of such
shares are subject to leak-out agreements. Pursuant to such agreements, each of these stockholder’s common stock can only be sold
in an amount equal to 0.25% (1/4%) of our outstanding securities (to be defined for all purposes thereof as the amount indicated in our
most recent filing with the SEC) during each of the four quarterly periods beginning on January 1, 2017; 0.01 (1%) of our outstanding
securities during each of the next four successive quarterly periods, all on a non-cumulative basis, meaning that if no common stock
was sold during any quarterly period while common stock was qualified to be sold, such shares of common stock cannot be sold in the next
successive quarterly period (the “Leak-Out Period”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stockholder subject to a lock-up/leak-out
agreement that owns less than 100,000 shares of common stock that are covered thereby, is allowed to sell such stockholder’s common
stock. Our remaining outstanding shares are mostly freely tradable under Rule 144 and certain limitations on the number of shares that
can be sold quarterly by “affiliates” of the Company as defined under the Securities Act. Any sales of substantial amounts
of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales might occur, could harm the market price of our common stock.
See the captions “Market Price of Common Stock and Related Matters” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
and Management” of Part II, Item 5, below for further information. Further, certain stockholders have “piggy-back”
registration rights afforded to them if we file a registration statement with the SEC; these shares or any registered securities we may
register can also have an adverse effect on any market for our common stock.
We
will not solicit the approval of our stockholders for the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock unless this
approval is deemed advisable by our Board of Directors or is required by applicable law, regulation or any applicable stock exchange
listing requirements. The issuance of additional shares would dilute the value of our outstanding shares of common stock.

Risk
Management and Strategy
Management
is to perform a corporate risk assessment annually, which includes specific consideration and assessment of cybersecurity risk, proportional
to the size of the Company. Service providers must meet certain security requirements such as security incident or data breach notification
and response protocols, data encryption requirements, and data disposal commitments.
23
In
managing cybersecurity risk, we employ a defense-in-depth strategy and regularly monitor our cyber environment for potential new threats.
Our strategy includes employee training and awareness on cybersecurity risks and related best practices, required password complexity,
the use of multi-factor authentication, information security protocols, anti-virus and anti-ransomware software.
Governance
Our
Board of Directors provides oversight of our cybersecurity program through an annual risk review. On an annual basis, cybersecurity risk
and mitigation strategies are reviewed as part of management’s reporting to the Board of Directors, which includes reporting significant
business risks, including cybersecurity mitigation strategies employed to manage these risks, and a review of any emerging risks. Annually,
management is to provide an overview of our cybersecurity program to the Board of Directors, including a review of key strategies, emerging
risks, and a summary of key performance indicators. As of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity
incidents.

Information
Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol “SUND.” There is no “established trading market” for our
shares of common stock. No assurance can be given that any established trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained,
and if an established trading market develops in the future, the sale of shares of our common stock that are deemed to be “restricted
securities” or “control securities” pursuant to Rule 144 of the SEC by members of management or others may have a substantial
adverse impact on any such market.
Holders
As
of June 29, 2025, we had 128 stockholders of record and an indeterminate number of stockholders who held shares in “street name.”
Dividends
There
are no present material restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock. Presently, we have no
plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors intends to pursue a policy of retaining earnings, if any, for
use in our operations and to finance the expansion of our business. Any declaration and payment of dividends in the future, of which
there can be no assurance, will be determined by our Board of Directors in light of existing conditions, including our earnings, financial
condition, capital requirements and other factors. There are presently no dividends which are accrued or owing with respect to our outstanding
common stock. No assurance can be given that dividends will ever be declared or paid on our common stock in the future.

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company issued 1,544,550 warrants to the Chairman of the Board of Directors in conjunction with an
extension of the maturity dates of certain debt instruments. The exercise price of these warrants was $0.41 per share. The value of the
warrants on the date of grant, as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model was $435,199. The valuation inputs included
a fair value of the underlying common stock of $0.409 per share, a risk-free interest rate of 4.43%, an expected volatility of 83.74%
and a dividend yield of of 0%.
From
June 18, 2024, to July 10, 2024, the Company received subscription agreements from investors, for 805,000 common shares at a purchase
price of $1 per share, including 1,610,000 warrants exercisable at $0.35 per share, vested immediately upon issuance, with a five year

“estimate,” “project,” “intend,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating

operations. Reference is also made to the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” at the forepart of this Annual Report, which
information is incorporated herein by reference.
Overview
Legacy
Business (Overview):
Our
historical business model focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and related residual interests, such as net insurance
benefits (NIBs). These NIBs provided us with the right to receive a portion of settlement proceeds from third-party-held policy portfolios,
after associated servicing and financing costs. As of the date of this report, we no longer directly hold NIBs or life insurance policies.
25
Current
Focus:
Since
the latter part of fiscal 2021, our efforts have shifted toward providing professional services to specialty finance groups, bond issuers,
and aggregators in the life settlement space. Our role includes advising on portfolio construction and applying proprietary analytics
to help structure bond offerings secured by life insurance assets and managed cash. We aim to assist clients with asset assembly, cash
management, and support for both investment- and non-investment-grade credit ratings. In exchange, we will be reimbursed for structuring
expenses, earn an advisory fee upon closing, and retain residual rights to certain underlying assets post-maturity.
For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, the Company earned no revenue from bond advisory or portfolio consulting services. Management continues
to pursue opportunities, but no definitive engagements were in place as of the date of this report.
Results
of Operations
Fiscal
year ended March 31, 2025 compared to March 31, 2024
General
& Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses totaled $604,167 and $531,406 during the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively. A significant
portion of these expenses were professional fees, payroll, and rent. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to increased
professional fees during 2025.
Other
Income and Expenses
During
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt totaling $435,199 and $1,047,729, respectively,
in connection with related party debt arrangements. The decrease in loss for the year ended March 31, 2025, reflects a lower volume of
debt extensions or modifications that resulted in extinguishment accounting treatment compared to the prior year.
During
the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized gains on the settlement of debt of $0 and $290,000, respectively. The decline
in recognized gains during the year ending March 31, 2025 was due to the absence of any debt settlements or negotiated reductions with
vendors.
For
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, interest expense totaled $349,016 and $410,856 , respectively. The decrease in interest expense
was a result of less amortization of debt discount during 2025.
For
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, expenses incurred pursuing potential financing alternatives totaled $215,000 and $135,000,
respectively. The increase in financing-related expenses is primarily attributable to increased costs incurred in connection with bond
structuring and placement efforts.
Income
Taxes
During
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company recorded a net loss before income taxes of $1,603,382 and $1,834,991, respectively.
The reduction in net loss is largely due to decrease in losses from extinguishing debt, partially offset by the lack of gain on settlement
of debt.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Since
our inception, our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity instruments, debt financing, lines of credit and notes
payable from related parties, and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of March 31, 2025, we had $168,648 of cash, compared to
$329,860 as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had access to draw an additional $4,265,942 on the notes payable, related
party, and $3,000,000 on the Convertible Debenture Agreement. Our monthly expenses average approximately $50,000, which includes the
salary of our employee, policy servicing expenses, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses, and
estimated legal and accounting expenses. Outstanding Accounts Payable as of March 31, 2025, totaled $446,885, and other accrued liabilities
totaled $880,073. We believe that the available capacity under our existing related party lines of credit, together with our current
capital resources, will be sufficient to fund our operating and working capital needs for at least the 12-month period following the
issuance of these financial statements.
26
2025
Cash Flows Compared to 2024 Cash Flows
For
the year ended March 31, 2025, we recorded net cash used in operating activities of $916,212, compared to $666,643 during the prior year.
The increase in cash used is primarily attributable to a lower non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended March 31, 2025,
which resulted in a smaller adjustment to reconcile net loss to operating cash. This was partially offset by the absence of a non-cash
gain on the settlement of liabilities that had negatively impacted operating cash flow in the year ended March 31, 2024.
For
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 no cash was used in or provided by investing activities.
During
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 net cash provided by financing activities was $755,000, and $995,950, respectively. The Company
borrowed on new related party promissory notes and existing notes payable and lines-of-credit in the amounts of $180,950 during the year
ended March 31, 2024. Additionally, during the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company received $805,000 and $850,000 in proceeds
raised by issuance of our common stock through private placement memorandums, respectively.
Debt
At
March 31, 2025, we owed $5,354,633, including accrued interest, for debt obligations. We owed $3,290,058 in principal pursuant to notes
payable and lines-of-credits from related parties and $300,000 in other notes payable. As of March 31, 2025, one note payable had a principal
balance of $1,159,508 and has been extended to be due on November 30, 2026 or when the Company completes a successful equity raise (if
earlier than the due date), at which time principal and interest is due in full. The second note payable and line-of-credit had a principal
balance of $1,304,550, and the line of credit and has been extended to be due November 30, 2026. The third series of related-party promissory
notes had a total principal balance of $826,000 and is due on November 30, 2025. The convertible debenture agreement, which has no principal
balance due as of March 31, 2025, is open through August 31, 2026. As of June 30, 2025, there was $4,265,942  available under the
lines-of-credit we currently have with related parties and $3,000,000 available under the 8% convertible debenture agreement.
We
may borrow money in the future to finance our operations but can make no guarantees that such credit will be made available to us. Any
such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the debt holder in the event we are unsuccessful in repaying such loans.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to operate and
meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business. As the Company does not currently generate revenue, it will need to rely on
related party debt financing and/or additional capital raises to meet its financial obligations.
Management
believes that existing capital resources, along with availability under related party debt agreements and convertible debentures, will
be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements. While related
parties have provided informal assurances of continued support—such as maturity extensions and additional credit capacity—no
binding commitments are currently in place. Based on these factors, management has concluded that there is no substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through June 2026.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Estimates,
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock
Based Compensation and Financing Costs, we measure stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock-based awards and stock
based expense associated with certain financing costs based on the estimated fair value of the awards as determined on the date of grant
and is recognized as expense over the remaining requisite service period or vesting period of the warrant. We utilize the Black-Scholes
pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options issued as compensation and warrants issued as financing costs. The Black-Scholes
model requires the input of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the estimated fair value of our common stock on the
date of grant, the expected term of the stock option and warrant, and the expected volatility of our common stock over the period equal
to the expected term of the grant or warrant. Uncontrollable uncertainties, such as fluctuation in interest rates, can have an effect
on our Black-Scholes estimate calculations. Such fluctuations and other unforeseen changes in inputs could have a material impact on
the general and administrative expenses within our financial statements. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the
estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Fair
Value, As defined by ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. ASC 820 also requires the consideration of differing levels of inputs in the determination of fair values.
Those
levels of input are summarized as follows:
●
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
●
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market.
●
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments
whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as instruments for
which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The
level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
We
did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the years
ended March 31, 2025, and 2024.
28
Our
recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values based on their short-term
nature. The recorded values of the Notes Payable, Related Parties and Convertible Debenture approximates the fair values as the interest
rate approximates market interest rates.

on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sundance Strategies, Inc. and Subsidiary (“the Company”) as
of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2025 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing a separate audit opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures
to which it relates.
Evaluation
of a Going Concern
Description
of the Critical Audit Matter
As
described further in Note 9 to the financial statements, the Company has relied on debt and equity financing to finance operations, as
there are not sufficient cash flows from operations, which raises doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management
has implemented plans to alleviate the substantial doubt. Management plans to address the concerns, as needed, by (a) utilizing recent
financing obtained through notes payable; and (b) utilizing current lines of credit. When considering these factors in conjunction with
the Company’s operating plan, management believes it has sufficient ability to fund operations and satisfy the Company’s
obligations as they come due for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date.
We
determined the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and execution
uncertainty regarding the Company’s available capital and the risk of bias in management’s judgments and assumptions in their
determination.
How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our
audit procedures related to the Company’s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among
others:
●We
performed testing procedures such as analytical procedures to identify conditions and events
that indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as
a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
●We
reviewed and evaluated management’s plans for dealing with adverse effect of these conditions
and events that raised doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
●We
tested the reasonableness of management’s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient
liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance
date.
●We
assessed whether the Company’s determination that there is substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern was adequately disclosed.

ORGANIZATION
Sundance
Strategies, Inc. (formerly known as Java Express, Inc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, and
engaged in the retail selling of beverage products to the general public until these endeavors ceased in 2006; it had no material business
operations from 2006, until its acquisition of ANEW LIFE, INC. (“ANEW LIFE”), a subsidiary of Sundance Strategies, Inc. (“Sundance
Strategies”, “the Company”, “we” or “our”).
Our
historical business model has focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products
tied to life insurance policies, including notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part
or all of the sales price of insurance, life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace, often
referred to as the “life settlements market.”
During
the latter part of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we began developing an additional business offering, providing professional
services to specialty structured finance groups, bond issuers and life settlement aggregators. We have assembled an experienced team
from the life settlement marketplace, as well as from other areas such as financial services and public financial markets. As a professional
services provider, we apply industry best practices to advise on the selection of specific portfolios of life insurance policies that
are tailored to meet the needs of its clients. Our clients may include bond issuers, bond investors, or other structured finance product
issuers. We develop strategies and methodologies which include the acquisition of life insurance portfolios, then use common structured
finance techniques and proprietary analytics to structure bonds for issuances, including principal protected bonds. Our goal is to deliver
long-term value and profitability to shareholders by growing our professional services business and asset base, resulting in the ability
to pay dividends to its shareholders.
During
the latter part of the year ended March 31, 2021, we began working closely with bond placement agents and aggregators to establish various
aspects of a proprietary, investment grade bond offering. In this arrangement, we participate as the sole originator in the role of structuring
and advising on the structure of the proprietary bond instrument. Included in the role of structuring financial assets, we use proprietary
analytics to establish the makeup of the rated instrument, including but not limited to life settlement assets (life insurance policies)
and managed cash, and implement a process of selective assembly of the underlying assets and cash management that will meet the policy
requirements and analytics. We provide current and ongoing resources for all analytics, as well as advisement support for the investment
and non-investment grade ratings for the managed asset pool and the managed cash accounts. In our advisory role, we are reimbursed for
all expenses associated with the structuring and preparation of any bond offering, will receive an advisory payment upon the closing
of any bond offering, and then will hold residual rights on the balance of assets once the bond is retired.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Estimates,
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents, For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Basic
and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share, Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the periods presented using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share is computed
by including common shares that may be issued subject to existing rights with dilutive potential, when applicable. Potential dilutive
common stock equivalents are primarily comprised of potential dilutive shares resulting from convertible debt agreements and common stock
warrants. Potentially dilutive shares resulting from convertible debt agreements are evaluated using the if-converted method. Potentially
dilutive securities are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, because
to do so would be anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of March 31, 2025, and 2024, include warrants convertible
into 14,496,123 and 14,043,573 shares of common stock, respectively.
Stock-Based
Compensation and Financing Costs, The Company measures stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock-based awards and
stock-based expense associated with certain financing costs on the estimated fair value of the awards as determined on the date of grant
and is recognized as expense over the remaining requisite service period for options and vesting period for warrants. The Company utilizes
the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options issued as compensation and warrants issued as financing costs.
The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the estimated fair value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant, the expected term of the stock option and warrant, and the expected volatility of the Company’s
common stock over the period equal to the expected term of the grant. The Company estimates forfeitures at the date of grant and revises
the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
F-6
Income
Taxes, The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Accounting standards require the
consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that some component or all
of the benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The
tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not
of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The Company has examined the tax positions taken in its
tax returns and determined that there are no uncertain tax positions. As a result, the Company has recorded no uncertain tax liabilities
in its balance sheet. Interest and penalties for uncertain positions, when applicable, would be recognized as a component of income tax
expense.
The
Company files United States Federal and State income tax returns. The income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by
taxing authorities for three to five years from the date they are filed. The Company has tax returns subject to examination for 2018-2023.
Principles
of Consolidation, The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. The subsidiary is
wholly owned. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Fair
Value, As defined by ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. ASC 820 also requires the consideration of differing levels of inputs in the determination of fair values.
Those
levels of input are summarized as follows:
●
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
●
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market.
●
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments
whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as instruments for
which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The
level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The
Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during
the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024.
The
Company’s recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values
based on their short-term nature. The recorded values of the Notes Payable, Related Parties and Convertible Debenture approximates the
fair values as the interest rate approximates market interest rates.
(3)
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The
Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any,
on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements
will have a significant effect on its financial statements.
F-7
(4)
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash
and cash equivalents consist principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. The Company had $168,648 and $329,860
in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The Company maintains non-interest-bearing accounts at two
financial institutions. The accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000.
As of March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company had balances in excess of FDIC insured amounts at these institutions $0 of and $79,779, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE
On
April 6, 2021, the Company borrowed $300,000 under an unsecured promissory note with Satco International, Ltd. This promissory note bears
interest at a rate of 8% annually and was due January 6, 2022. In conjunction with this note, the Company issued warrants for 1,000,000

financing or other proceeds are received. This extension has no bearing on the warrants that were issued in conjunction with the original
promissory note. The warrants associated with this unsecured promissory note expired without being exercised on April 6, 2024. This note
is separate from the 8% convertible debenture agreement that the Company has in place with Satco International, Ltd. (see note 8). As

was amended to extend the due date from November 30, 2024, to November 30, 2025, and later November 30, 2026, or at the immediate time
when alternative financing or other proceeds are received. The
note payable and line of credit agreement incurs interest at 7.5%
per annum. During the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 the Company borrowed $0
and $40,000,
respectively of principal under this agreement and made no repayments of principal. On July 5, 2024, the company made a payment on accumulated
interest of $136,800.
As of March 31, 2025, accrued interest on this agreement totaled $538,868.
As per the provision outlined in Note 8, and in conjunction with the $40,000
borrowed under the note payable and lines of credit agreement
during the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company also agreed to provide Radiant Life, LLC with warrants for 80,000
shares of common stock vested immediately upon issuance, having
exercise price of $1.05,
and a 5-year
exercise window from the dates of issuance. As per the provision outlined in Note 8, and in conjunction with the extension on February
1, 2024, the Company also agreed to provide Radiant Life, LLC with warrants for 699,754
shares of common stock vested immediately upon issuance, having
exercise price of $1.05,
and a 5-year
exercise window from the dates of issuance. As per the provision outlined in Note 8, and in conjunction with the extension subsequent
to March 31, 2025, the Company also agreed to provide Radiant Life, LLC with warrants for 1,399,508
shares of common stock vested immediately upon issuance, having
exercise price of $0.41,
and a 5-year
exercise window from the dates of issuance. The total number of warrants issued to the related party lender was 3,229,016
as of March 31, 2025 (see Note 8 for further details).

CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AGREEMENT
The
Company has entered into an 8% convertible debenture agreement with Satco International, Ltd., that allows for borrowings of up to $3,000,000.
The holder originally had the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest to unregistered, restricted common stock
of the Company on June 2, 2016. Per the agreement, the number of shares issuable at conversion shall be determined by the quotient obtained
by dividing the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest by 90% of the 90-day average closing price of the Company’s
common stock from the date the notice of conversion is received; and the price at which the Debenture may be converted will be no lower
than $1.00 per share. The original maturity date was June 2, 2016, but was later extended, through a series of extensions, to August
31, 2026. On January 3, 2025 the convertible debenture agreement with Satco International, Ltd. was amended to extend the due date from
August 31, 2025, to August 31, 2026, or at the immediate time when alternative financing or other proceeds are received. This extension
has no bearing on the warrants that were issued in conjunction with the original promissory note.
F-9
As
of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the Company owed $0 under the agreement, excluding accrued interest. The associated interest of
$124,225 is recorded on the balance sheet as an Accrued Expense obligation at March 31, 2025, and 2024.

books of the Company. The total number of common shares canceled/retired was 8,000,000. The total liability related to the repurchase
of these shares is $400,000, with repayment contingent on a major financing event.

The
Company’s related party lenders consist of: the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, Radiant Life, LLC and Mr.
Dickman, a board member and stockholder. These holders of the related party unsecured promissory notes hold agreements that provide each
related party with common stock warrants upon the lender’s extension of a maturity due date or upon the loaning of additional monies.
The number of warrants issued for an extension is based on the following formula for borrowings occurring on or before March 31, 2024:
10,000 warrants per month the due date is extended plus 1 warrant for every $2 of the principal balance outstanding (not including interest)
at the time of the extension (rounded to the nearest whole warrant). For borrowings occurring after March 31, 2024, the formula has been
adjusted to the following: 20,000 warrants per month the due date is extended plus 1 warrant for every $1 of the principal balance outstanding
(not including interest) at the time of the extension (rounded to the nearest whole warrant). Upon the loaning of additional monies,
the lenders will also require 2 warrants for each dollar loaned. All warrants issued under these terms vested immediately upon issuance,
have an exercise price approximately equivalent to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and expire
5 years from the date of issuance.
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company issued no new warrants in conjunction with monies borrowed during the period

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND GOING CONCERN
Since
the Company’s inception on January 31, 2013, its operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity, debt financing
from related parties and the issuance of notes payable and convertible debentures. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had $168,648 of
cash assets, compared to $329,890 as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had access to draw an additional $4,265,942
on the notes payable, related party (see Note 6) and $3,000,000 on the Convertible Debenture Agreement (see Note 7). For the year ended
March 31, 2025, the Company’s average monthly operating expenses were approximately $50,000, which includes salaries of our employees,
consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses and legal and accounting expenses. In addition to the monthly
operating expenses, the Company continues to pursue other debt and equity financing opportunities, and as a result, financing expenses
of $215,000 and $135,000 were incurred during the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively. As management continues to explore
additional financing alternatives, beginning April 1, 2025, the Company is expected to spend up to an additional $300,000 on these efforts.
Outstanding Accounts Payable as of March 31, 2025 totaled $446,885. Management has concluded that its existing capital resources and
availability under its existing convertible debentures and debt agreements with related parties will be sufficient to fund its operating
working capital requirements for the 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements. Related parties have given informal assurance
of their continued support, by way of either extensions of due dates, or increases in lines-of-credit. As mentioned above, the Company
also continues to evaluate other debt and equity financing opportunities.
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which the Company is expected to be able to realize
its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business.

INCOME TAXES
The
Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting
for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.
The
Company recorded $0 provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024.
The
income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal tax rate of 21% to pretax income from
continuing operations for the years ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, due to the following:

The
Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets at March 31, 2025. Factors considered in this
assessment include recent and expected future earnings and the Company’s liquidity and equity positions. The Company has placed
a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards.
As
of March 31, 2025, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $30,513,827. These carry forwards are available to
offset future taxable income, if any, and begin to expire in 2026. The utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards is dependent
upon the tax laws in effect at the time the net operating loss carry forwards can be utilized and may be significantly limited based
on ownership changes within the meaning of section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under
FASB ASC 740-10-05-6, tax benefits are recognized only for the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized
upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in the company’s tax return that do not meet these
recognition and measurement standards.
The
Company had no liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the Company has recorded no additional interest or penalties.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission’s
rules and forms.
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of March 31, 2025. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2025, the end of the period covered
by this Annual Report on Form 10-K due to the material weakness described below.
(b)
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives as specified above.
Management does not expect, however, that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to
error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
Management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2025. In making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weakness described below.
(c)
Material Weaknesses
As
defined in SEC Regulation S-X, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management determined that the following material weaknesses existed
as of March 31, 2025: The design and operating effectiveness of our control environment and risk assessment, control activities and monitoring
activities were inadequate to ensure that complex accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments
are always properly accounted for and reviewed in a timely manner.
30
Our
principal executive and principal financial officer is in the process of performing a review of our processes and controls over complex
accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments.
Notwithstanding
the identified material weakness, the Company believes the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent
in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.
(d)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other
than described above in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

9B. Other Information
Warrant
Issuances

Director
Qualifications
In
evaluating members for services on the Board of Directors, emphasis was placed on the following factors: (i) the appropriate size of
our Board of Directors; (ii) our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors; (iii) the knowledge, skills
and experience of the directors, including experience in development stage companies and new enterprises and innovations, finance, administration
and management skills; and (iv) the dedication of the directors to familiarize themselves with the our selected business industry.
Our
goal was to assemble a Board of Directors that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business
and professional experience. We believe each of the members of our Board of Directors possesses these qualities.
Background
and Business Experience
Kraig
T. Higginson is 68 years of age and was appointed to the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Higginson served as Chief
Executive Officer of VIA Motors, Inc. (“Via Motors”), a hybrid electric vehicle company (PHEV), from November 2010 to January
2014, where he was responsible for overseeing the management and business of Via Motors and its employees. From October 2003 until November
2010, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Raser Technologies, Inc. (“Raser Technologies”), which was an NYSE
listed company at that time. Mr. Higginson resigned as a director of Raser Technologies on February 11, 2011. Raser Technologies filed
bankruptcy proceedings on April 29, 2011, and was subsequently delisted from NYSE. Mr. Higginson also founded American Telemedia Network,
Inc. (“American Telemedia”), a publicly-traded NASDAQ company that developed a nationwide satellite network broadcasting
data, video programming and advertising to shopping centers and malls, and he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of American
Telemedia from 1984 through 1988. Mr. Higginson’s years of experience in the management of public companies is a great asset to
the Company.
Mr.
Glenn S. Dickman is 75 years of age. In 1984, Mr. Dickman started a “sales rack” jobbing operation supplying grocery stores
with movies for rent and purchase. As founder and CEO of Video II, the business grew from servicing one store to over 1,400 located in
38 states. Video II had over 400 employees at one time, with Mr. Dickman overseeing all facets of the business as its CEO. In 2005, Mr.
Dickman sold his interest in Video II, and has since concentrated his efforts on a variety of investments, including stocks and real
estate. Mr. Dickman’s years of experience running various business entities is an invaluable resource to the board of directors.
Stephen
Quesenberry is 62 years old. He has practiced law since 1989 in Washington and Utah, including complex business litigation and SEC matters.
Mr. Quesenberry was one of the (many) attorneys representing Exxon Shipping in the Exxon Valdez litigation in Alaska in the early 1990s.
Mr. Quesenberry has also been a principal in various property development projects in Washington and elsewhere. Mr. Quesenberry graduated
from Brigham Young University in 1986 with a degree in English and was a pitcher for the BYU Cougars varsity baseball team from 1983-1986.
He attended law school at the University of Kansas from 1986-1989, where he was an editor of the Kansas Law Review and a member of the
Order of the Coif. He also speaks fluent German. Mr. Quesenberry’s legal expertise makes him a great resource for the board of
directors.
Mr.
Randall F. Pearson is 70 years old. He is currently serving as a member of the Board of Directors and as President and Principal Financial
Officer. Mr. Pearson has served as President of the Company since inception in 2013. Prior to Sundance he worked with JWD Management
Corp. for 26 years. During his time with JWD Management he served in several positions including Vice President of Operations, Vice President,
President and CEO. JWD Management was a nationally recognized distribution supplier providing products to grocery stores in 33 states
and managing over 450 employees. Prior to JWD Management he worked with Capital Resources investing in and managing his own and client
owned residential and commercial real estate properties. Mr. Pearson attended Brigham Young University until 1977, received his real
estate brokers license in 1977 and his Series 7 securities license in 1978. Mr. Pearson’s many years of management and insight
into the operations of the Company create a unique and valuable perspective in his role as a director.

Corporate
Governance
Overview
Our
Bylaws provide that the size of our Board is to be determined by resolution of the Board. Our Board has fixed the exact number of directors
at four. Our Board currently consists of four members.
We
are subject to a number of technological, regulatory, product, legal and other types of risks. The Board is responsible for overseeing
these risks, and we employ a number of procedures to help them carry out that duty. For example, Board members regularly consult with
executive management about pending issues and expected challenges, and at each Board meeting directors receive updates from, and have
an opportunity to interview and ask questions of, key personnel and management. Furthermore, because our President serves as a member
of our Board, we believe that the Board has a direct channel and better access to insights into our performance, business and challenges.
Board
Leadership Structure
The
Board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board as the Board
believes it is in the best interests of the Company to make that determination based upon the position and direction of the Company and
the membership of the Board. The Board has determined at this time that the Company’s Chairman should not be its President.
The
Board has determined that of the current directors or nominees, Messrs. Higginson, Dickman and Quesenberry would qualify as independent
directors as that term is defined in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market if we were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
Such independence definition includes a series of objective tests, including that the director is not an employee of the Company and
has not engaged in various types of business dealings with the Company. As Mr. Pearson is also employed by the Company, the Board has
determined that Mr. Pearson is not currently independent. Although the Company’s common stock is not listed on The NASDAQ Capital
Market, the Company has applied The NASDAQ Capital Market independence rules to make its independence determinations.
Committees
of the Board of Directors
The
Board has not established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee. Therefore, the Board has not adopted
written charters for any of these committees. Because we have only four directors and one executive officer, we believe that we are able
to effectively manage the issues normally considered by such committees. The Board also does not have an audit committee financial expert.
We believe we are currently able to manage our audit and financial reporting obligations without an audit committee financial expert.
However, as we grow, we will consider adding an audit committee financial expert.
33
In
evaluating a director candidate, our Board of Directors will review his or her qualifications including capability, availability to serve,
conflicts of interest, general understanding of business, understanding of the Company’s business and technology, educational and
professional background, personal accomplishment and other relevant factors. Our Board of Directors has not established any specific
qualification standards for director nominees and we do not have a formal diversity policy relating to the identification and evaluation
of nominees for director, although from time to time the Board of Directors may identify certain skills or attributes as being particularly
desirable to help meet specific needs that have arisen. Our Board of Directors may also interview prospective nominees in person or by
telephone. After completing this evaluation, the Board of Directors will determine the nominees.
The
Board has not adopted a formal process for considering director candidates who may be recommended by stockholders. However, our policy
is to give due consideration to any and all such candidates. A stockholder may submit a recommendation for director candidates to us
at our corporate offices, to the attention of Randall F. Pearson. We do not pay fees to any third parties to assist us in identifying
potential nominees.
Number
of Meetings
The
Board held a total of one (1) meeting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. Each incumbent director attended the Board
meetings. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by directors at our annual meeting, we encourage directors to
attend. We did not hold an annual meeting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.
Codes
of Ethics and Business Conduct
We
have adopted a corporate Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which is available as Exhibit 14.1 to this filing. The Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct applies to all our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial

Executive
Compensation Objectives and Principles
The
overall objective of our executive compensation program is to help create long-term value for our stockholders by attracting and retaining
talented executives, rewarding superior operating and financial performance, and aligning the long-term interests of our executives with
those of our stockholders. Accordingly, our executive compensation program incorporates the following principles:
●
Compensation
should be based upon individual job responsibility, demonstrated leadership ability, management experience, individual performance,
and Company performance.
●
Compensation
should reflect the fair market value of the services received. We believe that a fair and competitive pay package is essential to
attract and retain talented executives in key positions.
●
Compensation
should reward executives for long-term strategic management and enhancement of stockholder value.
●
Compensation
should reward performance and promote a performance-oriented environment.
Executive
Compensation Procedures
We
believe that compensation paid to our executive officers should be closely aligned with our performance and the performance of each individual
executive officer on both a short-term and a long-term basis, should be based upon the value each executive officer provides to us, and
should be designed to assist us in attracting and retaining the best possible executive talent, which we believe is critical to our long-term
success. To attain our executive compensation objectives and implement the underlying compensation principles, we follow the procedures
described below.
Role
of the Board. The Board has responsibility for establishing and monitoring our executive compensation programs and for making decisions
regarding the compensation of Randall F. Pearson, our Named Executive Officer. The Board sets the compensation package of the Named Executive
Officers.
The
Board relies on its judgment in making compensation decisions after reviewing our performance and evaluating our executives’ leadership
abilities and responsibilities with our Company and their current compensation arrangements. The Board’s assessment process is
designed to be flexible to better respond to the evolving business environment and individual circumstances. The last Annual Meeting
of Stockholders was held in 2016.
Role
of Compensation Consultant. We have not engaged a compensation consultant.
Elements
of Compensation
Our
executive compensation objectives and principles are implemented through the use of the following elements of compensation, each discussed
more fully below:
●
Base
Salary
●
Annual
Incentive Bonuses
●
Stock-Based
Compensation
●
Other
Benefits
Base
Salary. The Board approved the salaries of all our executive officers for Fiscal Year 2025. Base salaries are offered to ensure that
our executive officers receive an ongoing level of compensation. Salary decisions concerning these officers were based upon a variety
of considerations consistent with the compensation philosophy stated above. First, salaries were competitively set relative to both other
companies in our industry and other comparable companies. The Board considered each officer’s level of responsibility and individual
performance, including an assessment of the person’s overall value to the Company. In addition, internal equity among employees
was factored into the decision. Finally, the Board considered our financial performance and our ability to absorb any increases in salaries.
35
Annual
Incentive Bonuses. Annual incentive bonuses are designed to reward extraordinary performance by our executives. For Fiscal Year 2025,
the Board did not precisely define the parameters of a bonus program for the Named Executive Officer, and no bonuses were awarded to
the Named Executive Office.
Stock-Based
Compensation. Each Named Executive Officer or Director is eligible to receive stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation
is designed to more closely align the interests of management with those of our stockholders. We do not have any securities authorized
for issuance under an equity compensation plan, or any policies for allocating compensation between long-term and currently paid out
compensation or between cash and non-cash compensation or among different forms of non-cash compensation. No stock-based compensation
was granted during the years ended March 31, 2025.
Other
Benefits. Our Named Executive Officer receive the same benefits that are available to all other full-time employees, including the
payment of health, dental, life and disability insurance premiums.
Deductibility
of Executive Compensation
Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain covered executives
to the extent such compensation exceeds $1.0 million per covered officer in any year. The Board understands that it is possible that
the compensation payable to our named executive officers will exceed the $1.0 million limit under Section 162(m). We believe that in
establishing the cash and equity incentive compensation programs for our named executive officers, the potential deductibility of the
compensation payable under those programs should be only one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration, and not the sole
governing factor. For that reason, we may deem it appropriate to provide one or more named executive officers with the opportunity to
earn incentive compensation, whether through annual cash incentive programs tied to our financial performance or through equity awards,
which together with base salary in the aggregate may be in excess of the amount deductible by reason of Section 162(m) or other provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe it is important to maintain cash and equity incentive compensation at the levels needed to attract
and retain the named executive officers essential to our success, even if all or part of that compensation may not be deductible by reason
of the Section 162(m) limitation.
The
compensation that we pay to the named executive officers is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as required by GAAP. The
Board considers the financial impact, along with other factors, in determining the amount and form of compensation provided to executives.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718.

13: CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTORS INDEPENDENCE
Review
and Approval of Related Person Transactions
Before
engaging in a related person transaction, the transaction is presented to non-interested board members for approval. In considering related
person transactions, the non-interested board members are guided by their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. The Board of Directors
does not have any written or oral policies or procedures regarding the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related
person. Additionally, each of our directors and executive officers are required to annually complete a directors’ and officers’
questionnaire that elicits information about related person transactions. Approval of a related person transaction is provided either
verbally or in writing.
Related
Person Transactions
Other
than as described below, there were no material transactions, or series of similar transactions, during our last two fiscal years, or
any currently proposed transactions, or series of similar transactions, to which we or any of our subsidiaries was or is to be a party,
in which the amount involved exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed
fiscal years and in which any director, executive officer or any security holder who is known to us to own of record or beneficially
more than 5% of any class of our common stock, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had an interest,
except as stated below.
As
of March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company had borrowed $3,290,058 and $3,340,058, respectively, excluding accrued interest, from related
parties. The interest associated with the Notes Payable, Related Party of $1,544,678, and $1,369,662 is recorded on the balance sheet
as an Accrued Expense obligation at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
38
Warrants
to Purchase Common Stock
The
Company’s related party lenders consist of: Kraig Higginson, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, Radiant
Life, LLC and Mr. Dickman, a board member and stockholder. These holders of the related party unsecured promissory notes, hold agreements
that provide each related party with common stock warrants upon the lender’s extension of a maturity due date or upon the loaning
of additional monies. The number of warrants issued for an extension is based on the following formula: for extensions occurring on or
before March 31, 2024, 10,000 warrants per month the due date is extended plus 1 warrant for every $2 of the principal balance outstanding
(not including interest) at the time of the extension (rounded to the nearest whole warrant), for extensions occurring after March 31,
2024, 20,000 warrants per month the due date is extended plus 1 warrant for every $1 of the principal balance outstanding (not including
interest) at the time of the extension (rounded to the nearest whole warrant). Upon the loaning of additional monies, the lender will
also require 2 warrants for each dollar loaned. All warrants issued under these terms vested immediately upon issuance, have an exercise
price approximately equivalent to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and expire 5 years from the
date of issuance.
During
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company issued no new warrants in conjunction with monies borrowed during the period (see Note 8 to
the financial statements included in this report).
During

extension of the maturity dates during the period (see Note 8 to the financial statements included in this report) per the terms outlined
above (see Note 11 to the financial statements included in this report for information on warrants issued subsequent to fiscal year end).
The exercise price of these warrants was $0.41. The value of the warrants on the date of grant, as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation model was $435,199. The inputs used in this calculation included a fair value of the underlying common stock of $0.409 per
share, a risk-free of 4.43%, volatility of 83.74%, and a dividend rate of 0%.
During
the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 281,900 warrants to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and 80,000 warrants to Radiant
Life, LLC in conjunction with monies borrowed during the period (see Note 8 to the financial statements included in this report). The
exercise price of these warrants was $1.05. The value of the warrants on the date of grant, as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation model was $316,756. The inputs used in this calculation included a fair value of the underlying common stock of $1.049 per
share, a risk-free between 3.36% and 4.29%, volatility between 86.52% and 89.11% and a dividend rate of 0%.
During
the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 1,106,000 warrants to Mr. Dickman, 772,275 warrants to the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, and 699,754 warrants to Radiant Life, LLC in conjunction with an extension of the maturity dates during the period (see Note
8 to the financial statements included in this report) per the terms outlined above. The exercise price of these warrants was either
$0.41 or $1.05. The value of the warrants on the date of grant, as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model was $964,277.
The inputs used in this calculation included a fair value of the underlying common stock between $0.409 and $1.049 per share, a risk-free
between 3.80% and 4.01%, volatility between 84.00% and 89.07% and a dividend rate of 0%.
As
of March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company held outstanding warrants to related parties totaling 10,686,123 and 10,843,573, respectively.
As of March 31, 2025, 2,006,754 of these warrants have an exercise price of $0.05, 3,579,579 of these warrants have an exercise price
of $0.41, 5,049,790 have an exercise price of $1.05, and 50,000 of these warrants have an exercise price of $2.00 per share. All warrants
have a five-year life as of the date of grant and expire between April 2025 and January 2030.
The
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered with the Commission and the holders of the warrants
do not have registration rights with respect to the warrants or the underlying shares of common stock.
Parents
We
have no parents.

Director
Independence
The
Board has determined that of the current directors, Messrs. Higginson, Dickman and Quesenberry would qualify as independent directors
as that term is defined in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market if we were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Such independence
definition includes a series of objective tests, including that the director is not an employee of the Company and has not engaged in
various types of business dealings with the Company. As Mr. Pearson is also employed by the Company, the Board has determined that Mr.
Pearson is not currently independent. Although the Company’s common stock is not listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company
has applied The NASDAQ Capital Market independence rules to make its independence determinations.
