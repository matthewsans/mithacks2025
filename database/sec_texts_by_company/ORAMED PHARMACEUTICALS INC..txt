Explanatory Note
Oramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”,
“we” or “us”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 (this “Amendment”) to amend the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”)
on March 27, 2025 (the “Original Form 10-K”). The purpose of this Amendment is solely to correct certain disclosures to Item
11. Executive Compensation specifically with respect to the compensation information of our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”)
as result of revising who qualified as NEOs for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters as a result of the change of NEOs.
In addition, pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Part IV, Item 15 has also been amended and restated
to include the currently dated certifications from the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant
to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Because no financial statements have been amended by or included in this Amendment and
this Amendment does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K,
paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. We are not including certifications pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as no financial statements are being filed with this Amendment.
No changes are hereby made to the Company’s
financial statements. Other than the changes discussed above and the filing of the currently dated certifications to this Amendment, no
changes have been made to the Original Form 10-K or the exhibits filed therewith. This Amendment has not been updated to reflect events
that occurred after March 27, 2025, the filing date of the Original Form 10-K. As such, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with
the Original Form 10-K.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This section explains the
policies and decisions that shape our executive compensation program, including its specific objectives and elements, as it relates to
our “named executive officers,” or NEOs.
Our NEOs for the year ended
December 31, 2024 are those three individuals listed in the “Summary Compensation Table” below. The Compensation Committee
believes that our executive compensation is appropriately designed to incentivize our NEOs to work for our long-term prosperity, is reasonable
in comparison with the levels of compensation provided by comparable companies and reflects a reasonable cost. We believe our NEOs are
critical to the achievement of our corporate goals, through which we can drive stockholder value.
The Compensation Committee
of our Board is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by Nasdaq and non-employee directors as defined by Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee has the authority and responsibility to review and approve the compensation of our President
and Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers. Other information concerning the structure, roles and responsibilities of our
Compensation Committee is set forth in “Board Meetings and Committees-Compensation Committee” section.
Our executive compensation
program and our NEOs’ compensation packages are designed around the following objectives:
●attract, hire, and retain talented and experienced executives;
●motivate, reward and retain executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success;
●ensure fairness among the executive management team via recognizing the contributions of each executive
to our success;
●focus executive behavior on achievement of our corporate objectives and strategy; and
●align the interests of management and stockholders by providing management with longer-term incentives
through equity ownership.
The Compensation Committee
reviews the allocation of compensation components regularly to ensure alignment with strategic and operating goals, competitive market
practices and legislative changes. The Compensation Committee does not apply a specific formula to determine the allocation between cash
and non-cash forms of compensation. Certain compensation components, such as base salaries, benefits and perquisites, are intended primarily
to attract, hire, and retain well-qualified executives. Other compensation elements, such as long-term incentive opportunities, are designed
to motivate and reward performance. Long-term incentives are intended to reward NEOs for our long-term performance and executing our business
strategy, and to strongly align NEOs’ interests with those of stockholders.
With respect to equity compensation,
the Compensation Committee makes awards to executives under our Amended and Restated 2019 Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan. Executive
compensation is paid or granted based on such matters as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including our financial and operating
performance and the alignment of the interests of the executive officers and our stockholders.
1
Elements of Compensation
Our executive officer compensation
program is comprised of: (i) base salary or monthly compensation; (ii) discretionary bonus; (iii) long-term equity incentive compensation
in the form of stock option and RSU grants; and (iv) benefits and perquisites.
In establishing overall executive
compensation levels and making specific compensation decisions for our NEOs in the year ended December 31, 2024, the Compensation Committee
considered a number of criteria, including the executive’s position, scope of responsibilities, prior base salary and annual incentive
awards and expected contribution.
Generally, our Compensation
Committee reviews and, as appropriate, approves compensation arrangements for the NEOs from time to time but not less than once each year.
The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration the President and Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations for executive
compensation of the other NEOs. The President and Chief Executive Officer generally presents these recommendations at the time of our
Compensation Committee’s review of executive compensation arrangements.
During the year ended December
31, 2024, the Compensation Committee received consulting services from Aon Solutions UK Limited., or Aon, with regard to management compensation.
The Compensation Committee engaged the consultant to review the Company’s current compensation plans for its management and collect
and analyze data regarding management compensation at other companies comparable to the Company, in order to provide a competitive compensation
benchmark. Aon collected SEC filings data regarding U.S. and Israeli compensation practices and developed a peer group of the following
U.S. and Israeli companies: ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., AN2 Therapeutics, Inc., Anavex Life Sciences Corp., Atossa Therapeutics Inc.,
aTyr Pharma, Inc., Chimerix, Inc., Compugen Ltd., Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc., Immunic, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova,
Inc., Pluri Biotech Ltd., Rani Therapeutics, Inc., Relmada Therapeutics, Inc., Rezolute, Inc., Vistagen Therapeutics, Inc., vTv Therapeutics
Inc. and Zevra Therapeutics, Inc.. Following its review, Aon provided recommendations for cash and equity compensation at various percentiles
for the Compensation Committee’s consideration.
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee
performs a review of base salaries and monthly compensation for our NEOs from time to time as appropriate. In determining salaries, the
Compensation Committee members also take into consideration the scope of the NEOs’ responsibilities and independent third-party
market data, such as compensation surveys to industry, individual experience and performance and contribution to our clinical, regulatory,
commercial and operational performance. None of the factors above has a dominant weight in determining the compensation of our NEOs, and
our Compensation Committee considers the factors as a whole when considering such compensation. In addition, our Compensation Committee
uses comparative data regarding compensation paid by peer companies in order to obtain a general understanding of current trends in compensation
practices and ranges of amounts being awarded by other public companies, and not as part of an analysis or a formula.
We believe that a competitive
base salary and monthly compensation is a necessary element of any compensation program that is designed to attract and retain talented
and experienced executives. We also believe that attractive base salaries can motivate and reward executives for their overall performance.
Base salary and monthly compensation are established in part based on the individual experience, skills and expected contributions to
our performance, as well as such executive’s performance during the prior year. Generally, we believe that executives’ base
salaries should be targeted near the median of the range of salaries for executives in similar positions with similar responsibilities,
experience and performance at comparable companies. Compensation adjustments are made occasionally based on changes in an executive’s
level of responsibility, company progress or on changed local and specific executive employment market conditions.
In November 2024, our Compensation
Committee increased the base salary of our NEOs by 15% (effective July 1, 2024 as it deemed this to be a reasonable rate based on, among
other factors, such NEO’s responsibilities and the report from Aon, as it determined the salaries were not in line with market compensation.
2
Performance Based Bonus
Our NEOs are eligible to receive
discretionary annual bonuses based upon performance. The amount of annual bonus to our NEOs is based on various factors, including, among
others, the achievement of scientific and business goals and our financial and operational performance. The Compensation Committee takes
into account the overall performance of the individuals, as well as the overall performance of the Company over the period being reviewed
and the recommendation of management. For any given year, the compensation objectives vary, but relate generally to strategic factors
such as developments in our clinical path, the execution of a license agreement for the commercialization of product candidates, the establishment
of key strategic collaborations, the build-up of our pipeline and financial factors such as capital raising. Bonuses are awarded generally
based on corporate performance, with adjustments made within a range for individual performance, at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee. The Compensation Committee determines, on a discretionary basis, the size of the entire bonus pool and the amount of the actual
award to each NEO. The overall payment is also based on historic compensation of the NEOs.
We believe that annual bonuses
payable based on the achievement of short-term corporate goals incentivize our NEOs to create stockholder value and attain short-term
performance objectives.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
Long-term incentive compensation
allows the NEOs to share in any appreciation in the value of our common stock. The Compensation Committee believes that stock participation
aligns executive officers’ interests with those of our stockholders. Equity incentive awards are generally made at the commencement
of employment and following a significant change in job responsibilities, or to meet other special retention or performance objectives.
The amounts of the awards are designed to reward past performance and create incentives to meet long-term objectives. Awards are made
at a level expected to be competitive within the biotechnology industry, as well as with Israeli-based companies. Awards are made on a
discretionary basis and not pursuant to specific criteria set out in advance. In determining the amount of each grant, the Compensation
Committee also takes into account the number of shares held by the executive prior to the grant. The vesting schedule for NEOs generally
provides for annual installments for new grants, though the Compensation Committee also utilizes quarterly vesting from time to time,
as well as performance-based vesting. The Compensation Committee believes that time-based vesting encourages recipients to build stockholder
value over a long period of time and that performance-based vesting encourages recipients to achieve goals that benefit the Company.
As part of its engagement
in the year ended December 31, 2024 described above, Aon also provided consulting services in connection with grants of equity awards
to our executive officers. Aon reviewed annual long-term incentive grants at peer companies, as well as such grants made by companies
in the broader market, based on a blend of Black-Scholes valuations and grants as a percentage of the applicable company’s capitalization.
Following such consultation, the Compensation Committee is considering alternative models and equity vehicles for future equity-based
grants.
Benefits and Perquisites
Generally, benefits available
to NEOs are available to all employees on similar terms and include welfare benefits, paid time-off, life and disability insurance and
other customary or mandatory social benefits in Israel. We provide some of our NEOs with a phone and a company car, which are customary
benefits in Israel to managers and officers.
We do not believe that the
benefits and perquisites described above deviate materially from the customary practice for compensation of executive officers by other
companies similar in size and stage of development in Israel. These benefits represent a relatively small portion of the executive officers’
total compensation.
Say-on-Pay Vote
Our stockholders approved,
on an advisory basis, our executive compensation program at our annual meeting of stockholders held on August 1, 2024. Over 90% of votes
cast were voted “for” the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the proxy statement for last year’s
annual meeting of stockholders. The Compensation Committee did not specifically rely on the results of the prior vote in making any compensation-related
decisions during the year ended December 31, 2024.

with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws of the United States. In the event the Company is required to
prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material non-compliance with any financial reporting
requirement under the securities laws, the Compensation Committee will require prompt reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess incentive

On January 2, 2025 the Compensation

no director received and/or accrued any compensation for his services as a director, including committee participation and/or special
assignments during the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, during 2024 the directors granted an aggregate of 142,500 RSUs that

The Company’s Policies and Practices
Related to the Grant of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of Material Nonpublic Information
We do not have any formal
policy that requires the Company to grant, or avoid granting, equity-based compensation at certain times. We do not grant equity awards
in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock,
and do not time the public release of such information based on award grant dates. The timing of any equity grants to executive officers
or directors in connection with new hires, promotions, or other non-routine grants is tied to the event giving rise to the award (such
as an executive officer’s commencement of employment or promotion effective date).
During the year ended December
31, 2024, there were no equity grants made to our executive officers during any period beginning four business days before the filing
of a periodic report or current report disclosing material non-public information and ending one business day after the filing or furnishing
of such report with the SEC.
ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.
Stock Option Plans
Our Board adopted the 2008
Plan and the 2019 Plan in order to attract and retain quality personnel.
The 2008 Plan, which is no
longer utilized for new grants, provided for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, and stock appreciation rights, collectively
referred to as “awards.” Under the 2008 Plan, as amended, 2,400,000 shares were reserved for the grant of awards. As of December
31, 2024, options with respect to 2,287,989 shares had been granted, of which 275,673 had been forfeited, 308,804 had been exercised and
1,420,504 have expired. As of December 31, 2024, 525,824 RSUs had been granted, none of them have vested and the shares of common stock
underlying those RSUs have not been issued and 34,118 have been forfeited.
The 2019 Plan provides for
the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, and stock appreciation rights, collectively referred to as “awards.” Under
the 2019 Plan, 1,000,000 shares were initially reserved for the grant of awards. On June 29, 2020, and August 3, 2020, respectively, our
Board and stockholders approved to amend and restate the 2019 Plan, the principal change being an increase in the number of shares of
common stock available under the 2019 Plan from 1,000,000 shares to 3,000,000 shares. On June 30, 2022, our Board and stockholders approved
to amend and restate the 2019 Plan, the principal change being an increase in the number of shares of common stock available under the
2019 Plan from 3,000,000 shares to 7,500,000 shares. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options under
the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or non-qualified stock options. Under the amended 2019 Plan, 7,500,000 shares are reserved
for the grant of awards, which may be issued at the discretion of our Board from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, options with respect
to 1,863,646 shares have been granted, of which 282,043 had been forfeited, 66,978 had been exercised and none of them were expired. As
of December 31, 2024, 4,808,060 RSUs had been granted, of which 290,125 have vested and the shares of common stock underlying those RSUs
have not been issued and 808,196 have been forfeited. Since the Company had granted options during the time after the 2008 Plan allegedly
terminated, and out of an abundance of caution, the Company canceled these grants and re-granted certain of the options under 2019 Plan
in the same amounts and under the same terms as the original grants.

with respect to the security through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, including a right to acquire
such power(s) during the 60 days following March 27, 2025. Inclusion of shares in the table does not, however, constitute an admission
that the named stockholder is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of those shares. Unless otherwise indicated, (1) each person or entity
named in the table has sole voting power and investment power (or shares that power with that person’s spouse) with respect to all
shares of common stock listed as owned by that person or entity and (2) the address of each of the individuals named below is: c/o Oramed
