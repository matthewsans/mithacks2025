EXPLANATORY NOTE
Aimei Health Technology Co., Ltd (the “Company,”
“we”, “our” or “us”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 (this “Amendment”) to the Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
on March 28, 2025 (the “Original Filing,” as amended by this Amendment, the “Annual Report”), as a comprehensive
amendment to amend and restate its disclosures included in the Original Filing to include risk factor disclosures and related discussions
concerning the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), in response to the SEC comment letter dated July 31, 2025.
Except as described above, this Amendment does not amend, update or
change any other items or disclosures contained in the Original Filing, and, accordingly, this Amendment does not reflect or purport to
reflect any information or events occurring after the date of the Original Filing or modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent

PART
I
Item
1. Business.
In
this
Annual Report, references to the “SPAC,” “Aimei Health,”
“Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Aimei Health Technology Co., Ltd.
Overview
We
are a blank check company incorporated on April 27, 2023 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
We seek to acquire small cap businesses in the biopharmaceutical, medical technology and device industries, as well as in the diagnostic
and other services sector. Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular geographic region.
On
December 6, 2023, we consummated our initial public officer (“IPO”) of 6,000,000 units (the “IPO Units”). Each
IPO Unit consists of one ordinary share, $0.0001 par value (the “Ordinary Share”), and one right (“Right”) to
receive one-fifth (1/5) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The IPO Units were sold at an
offering price of $10.00 per IPO Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. Pursuant to that certain underwriting agreement, dated
December 1, 2023, we granted Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, the representative of the underwriters, a 45-day option to purchase up
to an additional 900,000 units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Option Units,” together with the IPO Units,
the “Public Units”). Each Public Unit consists of one Ordinary Share (“Public Share”) and one right to receive
one-fifth (1/5) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination (“Public Right”). Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, generating total proceeds of $9,000,000.
Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO on December 6, 2023, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Aimei Investment
Ltd. (the “Sponsor”) of 332,000 units (the “Private Units,” and collectively with the Public Units, the “Units”),
generating total proceeds of $3,320,000. The Private Units are identical to the Public Units sold as part of the Public Units in this
offering. Additionally, the Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except
in limited circumstances, as described in the registration statement on Form S-1 (File Number 333-272230), as amended (the “IPO
Registration Statement”) for our IPO) until the completion of our initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain
demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.
On
December 6, 2023, a total of $69,690,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO and the Private Placement, were placed
in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the U.S. and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government
securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in
any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the
funds in the Trust Account to our shareholders.
We
paid a total of $1,380,000 in underwriting discounts (excluding deferred underwriting discount of $690,000) and $550,000 for other costs
and expenses related to the IPO.
Additionally,
the underwriters are entitled to $690,000, equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, payable to the underwriters as deferred
underwriting discounts at the closing of our initial business combination from the funds to be placed in the Trust Account. Such funds
will be released to the underwriters only upon consummation of an initial business combination, as described in the IPO Registration
Statement. If the business combination is not consummated, such deferred discounts will be forfeited by the underwriters. The underwriters
will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discount.
We
currently have till September 6, 2025 to consummate our initial business combination and thereafter, if we require additional time to consummate
our initial business combination, our board of directors may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to 12
times, each by an additional one-month period (for a total of up to 24 months to complete a business combination), subject to the authorization
by our board of directors and the deposit of additional funds into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees as
described elsewhere in this Annual Report. In the event we are unable to consummate a business combination within the allotted time period,
we will cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account and distribute the funds included therein to the holders of our securities sold
in the IPO and dissolve.

Proposed
Business Combination with United Hydrogen
On
June 19, 2024, we entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) for a business
combination with (i) United Hydrogen Group Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (“United
Hydrogen”), (ii) United Hydrogen Global Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (“Pubco”),
(iii) United Hydrogen Victor Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pubco (the “First Merger Sub”); (iv) United Hydrogen Worldwide Limited, an exempted company incorporated with
limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (the “Second Merger Sub”);
and (v) Aimei Investment Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company, in the capacity as, from and after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Closing”), the representative for our Company and our shareholders.
The
Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 20, 2024. Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report does not assume
the closing of the proposed business combination with United Hydrogen or the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.
The following description of the Business Combination Agreement and related agreements do not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the corresponding agreements, the forms of which are filed with our Current Report on
Form 8-K on June 20, 2024 as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5 and the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein.
Business
Combination Agreement
Pursuant

of the effective filing of the First Merger, and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the Second Merger Sub will
merge with and into our Company (the “Second Merger,” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), whereby
the separate existence of the Second Merger Sub will cease, and we will be the surviving corporation of the Second Merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pubco.
As
a result of the Mergers, among other things, (i) all outstanding ordinary shares of United Hydrogen, except for the United Hydrogen Specially
Designated Ordinary Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and the United Hydrogen Dissenting Shares (as defined in

and converted into the right to receive the number of Pubco Class B Ordinary Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement)
as determined in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, (iii) each convertible note of United Hydrogen that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to effective time of the First Merger, will be converted into such number of ordinary shares of United Hydrogen pursuant to the
terms thereof, which resulting shares will be converted into the right to receive such number of Pubco Class A Ordinary Shares based
on the Exchange Ratio, (iv) each issued and outstanding Unit of our Company shall be automatically detached and the holder thereof will
be deemed to hold one Ordinary Share and one Right, (v) each Ordinary Share shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive one Pubco Class A Ordinary Share, and (vi) every five issued and outstanding Rights shall be cancelled and automatically converted
into one Pubco Class A Ordinary Share. The Mergers, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement

Extension
of Deadline to Complete Initial Business Combination
Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have 12 months from the closing of our IPO to consummate
our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within
12 months, we may, by resolution of our board of directors if requested by the Sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination up to 12 times, each by an additional one month, for a total of up to 24 months to complete a business combination, subject
to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement dated December 1, 2023 entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company (the “Trust Agreement”), in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination
to be extended, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit
into the Trust Account an monthly extension fee of $227,700 (or $0.033 per Public Share in either case) each month on or prior to the
date of the applicable deadline for each extension. The Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account
to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Shareholders will not be granted any right to approve or disapprove
any such monthly extension, or redeem their securities in connection with any decision by us to extend the time frame to complete a business
combination from 12 months to up to 24 months.
Any
such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
of the Trust Account released to us. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter
agreement with our initial shareholders—including the Sponsor and our directors and officers as of the closing our IPO (collective,
“Initial Shareholders”)—contains a provision pursuant to which our Sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid
for such loans out of the funds held in the Trust Account in the event that we do not complete a business combination. Our Sponsor and
its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.
You will not be able to vote on or redeem your shares in connection with any such extension.

On
December 11, 2024 and January 13, 2025, the Sponsor and United Hydrogen caused the first and second monthly extension fee of
$227,700 (equivalent to $0.033 per Public Share), respectively, to be deposited into the Trust Account in accordance with the terms
set forth in the Trust Agreement, to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from December 6,
2024 to February 6, 2025. On February 5, 2024, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which approved the proposal
by our board of directors to amend the monthly fee payable by the Sponsor and/or its designee into the Trust Account to extend the
date by which we must consummate our initial business combination, from $0.033 per Public Share (for each monthly extension) to an
amount equal to $150,000 for all outstanding Public Shares (for each monthly extension). On February 6, 2025, March 6, 2025, April
4, 2025, May 6, 2025, June 6, 2025, July 6, 2025, and August 6, 2025, the Sponsor and United Hydrogen caused the third through
nineth monthly extension fee of $150,000, respectively, to be deposited into the Trust Account, to further extend the deadline from
February 6, 2024 to September 6, 2025. As of the date of this Annual Report, the deadline for completing of an initial business
combination was extended to September 6, 2025 and the Sponsor currently intends to continue to deposit additional funds as described
herein to further extend such deadline to up to 24 months from the closing of the IPO, to complete the initial business combination.
However, there is no guarantee that the Sponsor or United Hydrogen will make such deposit timely or at all as described
above.
Legal and Operational
Risks Related to Potential Business Combinations with PRC-Based Companies
Our Chief Financial Officer
is a citizen of Hong Kong. Additionally, one of our three independent directors, resides in China. As of the date of this Annual Report,
we are seeking to consummate the Business Combination with United Hydrogen, which is a Cayman Islands exempted company that conducts substantially
all of its operations through its PRC operating subsidiaries. If we do not consummate the Business Combination with United Hydrogen, we
may consider a business combination with another entity or business with a physical presence or other significant ties to China, including
Hong Kong and Macau, which may subject the post-business combination business to the laws, regulations and policies of China. Any alternative
target we may consider for a business combination may conduct operations through subsidiaries in China. The legal and regulatory risks
associated with doing business in China discussed in this report may make us a less attractive partner in an initial business combination
than other special purpose acquisition companies that do not have any ties to China. As such, our ties to China may make it harder for
us to complete an initial business combination with a target company without any such ties. In addition, we will not conduct a business
combination with any target company that conducts operations through variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are a series
of contractual arrangements used to provide the economic benefits of foreign investment in Chinese-based companies where Chinese law prohibits
direct foreign investment in the operating companies. As a result, this may limit the pool of acquisition candidates we may acquire in
the PRC, in particular, relative to other special purpose acquisition companies that are not subject to such restrictions, which could
make it more difficult and costly for us to consummate a business combination with a target business operating in the PRC relative to
such other companies.
If we consummate the
proposed Business Combination with United Hydrogen, or if we consummate our initial business combination with another target business
based in and primarily operating in the PRC, the combined company could be subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with
or having the majority of post-business combination operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing PRC based business operations
are sometimes vague and uncertain, and as a result these risks may result in material changes in the operations of any post-business combination
subsidiaries, significant depreciation of the value of our ordinary shares, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer, or continue
to offer, our securities to investors, including investors in the United States. Over the past few years, the PRC government has adopted
a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking
down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding
the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. These enacted measures, and new measures which may be implemented, could materially and adversely
affect the operations of any post-business combination company which we may acquire as our initial business combination.
In addition, it is highly
uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation-making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or
detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws
and regulations will have on a China-based target company’s daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments
and list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. Additionally, if we effect our initial business combination with a business located in the
PRC, the laws applicable to such business will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal
rights. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations which may have a material
adverse impact on the value of our securities. If we enter into a business combination with a target business operating in China, cash
proceeds raised from overseas financing activities, including the IPO, may be transferred by us to any future PRC subsidiaries via capital
contribution or shareholder loans, as the case may be. All these risks could result in a material change in our or the target company’s
post-combination operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
Furthermore, the PRC
government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company to conduct its business, make or accept
foreign investments or list on a U.S. stock exchange. For example, if we enter into a business combination with a target business operating
in China, the combined company may face risks associated with regulatory approvals of the proposed business combination between us and
the target, offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, cybersecurity and data privacy. The PRC government may also intervene
with or influence the combined company’s operations at any time as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political
and societal goals.
6
Over the past few years, the PRC government has
recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot
rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding any industry that could adversely affect
our potential business combination with a PRC operating business and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the
combined company. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could make it more difficult and costly for us to consummate a business
combination with a target business operating in the PRC, result in material changes in the combined company’s post-combination operations
and cause the value of the combined company’s securities to significantly decline, or in extreme cases, become worthless or completely
hinder the combined company’s ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors. Please see those factors described
under the heading “Risk Factors” in our filings with the SEC from time to time and the Registration Statement on Form
F-4 (File Number 333-284430) filed by United Hydrogen Group Inc. with the SEC.
On February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (the “CSRC”) promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies (the “Trial Measures”), which took effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures supersede the prior rules and clarified
and emphasized several aspects, which include but are not limited to: (1) comprehensive determination of the “indirect overseas
offering and listing by PRC domestic companies” in compliance with the principle of “substance over form” and particularly,
an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the Trial Measures if the following criteria are met at the same
time: (a) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated
financial statements for the most recent accounting year comes from PRC domestic companies, and (b) the main parts of the issuer’s
business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers
in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China; (2) exemptions from immediate
filing requirements for issuers that (a) have already been listed or registered but not yet listed in foreign securities markets, including
U.S. markets, prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures, (b) are not required to re-perform the regulatory procedures with the
relevant overseas regulatory authority or the overseas stock exchange, and (c) whose such overseas securities offering or listing shall
be completed before September 30, 2023, provided however that such issuers shall carry out filing procedures as required if they conduct
refinancing or are involved in other circumstances that require filing with the CSRC; (3) a negative list of types of issuers banned from
listing or offering overseas, such as (a) issuers whose listing or offering overseas has been recognized by the State Council of the PRC
as a possible threat to national security, (b) issuers whose affiliates have been recently convicted of bribery and corruption, (c) issuers
under ongoing criminal investigations, and (d) issuers under major disputes regarding equity ownership; (4) issuers’ compliance
with web security, data security, and other national security laws and regulations; (5) issuers’ filing and reporting obligations,
such as the obligation to file with the CSRC after it submits an application for initial public offering to overseas regulators, and the
obligation after offering or listing overseas to report to the CSRC material events including a change of control or voluntary or forced
delisting of the issuer; and (6) the CSRC’s authority to fine both issuers and their shareholders between 1 and 10 million RMB for
failure to comply with the Trial Measures, including failure to comply with filing obligations or committing fraud and misrepresentation.
We believe we are not required to obtain approvals from any PRC government
authorities, including the CSRC or the Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”), or any other government entity, to issue
our securities to foreign investors and to list on a U.S. exchange or to search for a target company. As of the date of this report, we
have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions or regulatory objection to the IPO from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental
authorities. However, applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations of the PRC may change or we could be mistaken about these rules
applicability, and the relevant PRC government agencies could reach a different conclusion and may subject us to a stringent approval
process from the relevant government entities in connection with the IPO, continued listing on a U.S. exchange, the potential business
combination, the issuance of shares or the maintenance of our status as a publicly listed company outside China, and the post business
combination entity’s PRC operations if our business combination target is a PRC Target Company. If the CSRC or the CAC, or any other
governmental or regulatory body subsequently determines that its approval is needed for the IPO, a business combination, the issuance
of our ordinary shares upon exercise of the rights, or maintaining our status as a publicly listed company outside China, we may face
approval delays, adverse actions or sanctions by the CSRC, CAC and/or other PRC regulatory agencies. It is uncertain whether we will be
required to obtain permission from the PRC government to continue to list on a U.S. exchange in the future and offer our securities to
foreign investors. If approval is required in the future, including pursuant to the Trial Measures, and we are denied permission from
Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges or offer our securities to foreign investors, we may not be able to continue listing on
a U.S. exchange or be subject to other severe consequences, which would materially affect our ability to complete a business combination
in which case we may have to liquidate which would be adverse to the interests of the investors. In addition, any changes in PRC law,
regulations, or interpretations may severely affect our operations after the IPO. The use of the term “operate” and “operations”
includes the process of searching for a target business and conducting related activities. To that extent, we may not be able to conduct
the process of searching for a potential target company in China.
7
There are numerous risks and uncertainties related
to doing business in China including:
●
Adverse changes in political and economic policies or political or social conditions of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China;
●
Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit legal protections available to you and us;
●
It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China
●
PRC companies in certain business sectors are required to undergo national security review or obtain clearance from relevant authorities if necessary before making any filings with the CSRC.
●
PRC companies must comply with national secrecy and data security laws with respect to any data disclosure.
●
CSRC has the authority to and may block offshore listings that: (1) are explicitly prohibited by law; (2) may endanger national security; (3) involve criminal offenses such as corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property by the issuer, its controlling persons (with a three-year lookback); (4) involve the issuer under investigations for suspicion of criminal offenses or major violations of laws and regulations; or (5) involve material ownership disputes.
Please see those factors
described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our filings with the SEC from time to time and the Registration Statement
on Form F-4 (File Number 333-284430) filed by United Hydrogen Group Inc. with the SEC.
Each of our officers and directors may become
an officer or director of another special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities intended to be registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, even before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business
combination. For more information, see the section of this report entitled “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate
Governance — Conflicts of Interest.”
Business
Strategy
Although
there is no restriction or limitation on what industry our target operates in, it is our intention to pursue prospective targets that
are focused on healthcare innovation. We anticipate targeting what are traditionally known as “small cap” companies domiciled
in North America, Europe and/or the Asia Pacific regions that are developing assets in the biopharmaceutical, medical technology/medical
device, and diagnostics space which aligns with our management team’s experience in operating health care companies and in drug
and device technology development as well as diagnostic and other services. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will
not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region. As such, although we are not targeting target companies in China, we may
consider an initial business combination with a target business with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong
and Macau). We believe that we will add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the U.S. capital markets.
We
will seek to capitalize on the strength of our management team. Our team consists of experienced professionals and senior operating executives.
Collectively, our officers and directors have decades of experience in financial oversight and operating companies in Asia. We believe
we will benefit from their accomplishments, and specifically their current and recent activities with companies that have a connection
to the Asian market, in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we will complete a business
combination.
We
believe that the members of our management team and board of directors have valuable and applicable experience for sourcing and analyzing
potential acquisition candidates across various industries and on an international basis based upon their professional experience. See
“Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for details of the background of our directors and
officers.
Investment
Criteria
Our
operating experience and industry contacts place us in a position to optimize our chances of identifying high-value targets in these
areas. Our target of small cap healthcare-based companies has been based on the concept of value investing and therefore focused on quality
businesses with specific and time-based catalysts. We will remain opportunistic at considering opportunities throughout the healthcare
space however, our primary focus has been on small cap healthcare companies with one or more of the following characteristics:
●
Late-stage
development or revenue-generating businesses
●
High
growth prospects with a sustainable proprietary position
●
Experienced
management teams with previous successes, especially where we can add critical public company expertise
●
Addressable
conditions that are clinically important and under-diagnosed or treated
●
Independent
companies or corporate spin-offs
●
Domestic
or International base of business
8
The
focus of our management team has been to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to efficiently guide an emerging healthcare
company towards commercialization. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that
we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating
prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:
●
We
believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses domestically and internationally with appropriate valuations
that can benefit from a public listing and new capital for growth to support significant revenue and earnings growth or to advance
clinical programs.
●
We
have been seeking target companies that have significant and underexploited expansion opportunities in a niche sector. This can be
accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets. Our management
team has significant experience in identifying such targets. Similarly, our management has the expertise to assess the likely synergies
and a process to help a target integrate acquisitions. Additionally, our management team has extensive experience assisting healthcare
companies raise money as they navigate the regulatory approval process.
●
We
have been seeking target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We aim to acquire
a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We have evaluated, and expect to evaluate, a target based on its
potential to successfully achieve regulatory approval and commercialize its product(s). We have also evaluated, and expect to evaluate,
financial returns based on (i) risk-adjusted peak sales potential (ii) the potential of pipeline products and the scientific platform
(iii) the ability to achieve the system cost savings, (iv) the ability to accelerate growth via other options, including through
the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (v) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential
upside, for example, from the growth in the target business’ earnings or an improved capital structure will be weighed against
any identified downside risks.
●
We
aim to invest in businesses that have a track record of success. We look for companies with shareholder-friendly governance and low
leverage, which are valued at what we think are low prices relative to their earnings potential and where we see attractive return
potential over the long run. We believe this investment approach constitutes our competitive advantage and can potentially offer
both meaningful upside potential and a degree of downside protection in periods of financial market turbulence.
These
criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be
based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management
may deem relevant.
Sources
of Target Businesses
We
anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers,
venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community.
Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or
mailings that will not commence until after the completion of the IPO. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they
think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of
businesses we are targeting.
9
Our
officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they
become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as
attending trade shows or conventions. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals
that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which
event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based
on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors or Initial Shareholders, or any entity
with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). Some of our officers
and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination.
The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business
combination candidate.
We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders, officers
or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders,
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company (or
shareholders) from a financial point of view.
Transfers of Cash to and from our Post Business
Combination Subsidiaries
As of the date of this
Annual Report, we are seeking to consummate the Business Combination with United Hydrogen, which is a Cayman Islands exempted company
that conducts substantially all of its operations through its PRC operating subsidiaries. There have not been any capital contributions
or shareholder loans by us to any PRC entities, we do not yet have any subsidiaries, and we have not received, declared or made any dividends
or distributions. If we consummate the proposed Business Combination with United Hydrogen, or if we consummate our initial business combination
with another target business based in and primarily operating in the PRC, the combined company, whose securities will be listed on a U.S.
stock exchange, may make capital contributions or extend loans to its PRC subsidiaries through intermediate holding companies subject
to compliance with relevant PRC foreign exchange control regulations.
After the initial business
combination, the combined company’s ability to pay dividends, if any, to the shareholders and to service any debt it may incur will
depend upon dividends paid by its PRC subsidiaries. Under PRC laws and regulations, PRC companies are subject to certain restrictions
with respect to paying dividends or otherwise transferring any of their net assets to offshore entities. In particular, under the current
PRC laws and regulations, dividends may be paid only out of distributable profits. Distributable profits are the net profit as determined
under Chinese accounting standards and regulations, less any recovery of accumulated losses and appropriations to statutory and other
reserves required to be made.
Current PRC regulations permit a potential PRC
target company’s indirect PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to an overseas subsidiary, for example, a subsidiary located in Hong
Kong, only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition,
each of the target’s subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to
fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. As a result, the combined company’s PRC subsidiaries
may not have sufficient distributable profits to pay dividends to the combined company. Furthermore, each such entity in China is also
required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside,
if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase
the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not
distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.
The PRC government also imposes controls on the
conversion of the Renminbi (“RMB”), the legal currency of the PRC, into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies
out of the PRC. Our initial business combination target may be a PRC company with substantially all of its revenues in RMB. Shortages
in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends
or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,
payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval
from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay
capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict
access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining
sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands post business combination, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to our security-holders. Furthermore, if our target’s subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future,
the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.
Cash dividends, if any, on our ordinary shares
will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas
shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and, as a result, may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.
The PRC government may take measures at its discretion
from time to time to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account or capital account transactions. If the foreign exchange
control regulations prevent the PRC subsidiaries of the combined company from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy their
foreign currency demands, the PRC subsidiaries of the combined company may not be able to pay dividends or repay loans in foreign currencies
to their offshore intermediary holding companies and ultimately to the combined company. We cannot assure you that new regulations or
policies will not be promulgated in the future, which may further restrict the remittance of RMB into or out of the PRC. We cannot assure
you, in light of the restrictions in place, or any amendment to be made from time to time, that the PRC subsidiaries of the combined company
will be able to satisfy their respective payment obligations that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the remittance of dividends
outside of the PRC. Please see those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our filings from time to
time with the SEC and the Registration Statement on Form F-4 (File Number 333-284430) filed by United Hydrogen Group Inc. with the SEC.

Initial
Business Combination
We
currently have until September 6, 2025 (or up to 24 months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination by the full amount of time, as described in more detail in this report) to consummate our initial business combination. If
we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible
but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account
and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board
of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the rights will be worthless.
Nasdaq
rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value
equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned)
at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If less
than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company,
the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value
test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate
value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq after the IPO, we would not be required to satisfy
the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of
our initial business combination.
We
anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares
will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial
business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target
business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target,
our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which
we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of
a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.
However,
as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination
could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders, officers
or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders,
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company (or
shareholders) from a financial point of view.
Members
of our management team and our independent directors and their affiliates will directly or indirectly own our Ordinary Shares following
the IPO, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business
with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest
with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included
by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Additionally, each of our officers
and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity,
including other blank check companies similar to our company, pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a
business combination opportunity to such entity. Specifically, our executive officers are affiliated with our Sponsor and other entities
that make, or are looking to make, investments in companies. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business
combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor
his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it
to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our
executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. For additional information regarding our
executive officers’ and directors’ business affiliations and potential conflicts of interest, see “Directors, Executive
Officers and Corporate Governance.” Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, subject
to fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer
unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and
such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
11
PRC Approvals
Below is a summary of
potential PRC laws and regulations that could be interpreted by the in-charge PRC government authorities, namely, the CSRC, the CAC and
their enforcement agencies, to require us to obtain permission or approval in order to issue securities to foreign investors in connection
with a business combination or offer securities to foreign investors. We do not believe that any permission or approval is required under
the PRC laws or regulations to offer securities to non-PRC investors. However, there is no assurance that such approval or permission
will not be required under the PRC laws, regulations or policies if the relevant governmental authorities take a contrary position, nor
can we predict whether or how long it will take to obtain such approval if so required.
CSRC Approval
The Regulations on Mergers
and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM, the State-Owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
(the “SAMR”), the CSRC, and the SAFE in 2006 and amended in 2009, as well as some other regulations and rules concerning mergers
and acquisitions (collectively, the “M&A Rules”) include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose
vehicle that is controlled by PRC domestic companies or individuals and that has been formed for the purpose of an overseas listing of
securities through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies or assets to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading
of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published its approval
procedures for overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability
of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. While the application of the M&A Rules remains unclear, we believe that
the CSRC approval would not be required in the context of a business combination because (1) the M&A Rules provide that the acquisition
of the equity held by the shareholders of a “domestic company” (i.e., a non-foreign investment company) or the subscription
for the new shares issued by a “domestic company” by the shareholders of an offshore special purpose vehicle with the equity
of such offshore special purpose vehicle, or by the offshore special purpose vehicle with its new shares for the purpose of the overseas
listing of such offshore special purpose vehicle, shall be subject to the approval of the CSRC; while we currently are a foreign-invested
enterprise rather than a “domestic company” as defined under the M&A Rules, and (2) the CSRC currently has not issued
any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether a transaction of the kind contemplated herein is subject to the M&A Rules.
However, uncertainties still exist as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted and implemented.
On February 17, 2023,
the CSRC promulgated the Trial Measures, which took effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures supersede the prior rules and clarified
and emphasized several aspects, which include but are not limited to: (1) comprehensive determination of the “indirect overseas
offering and listing by PRC domestic companies” in compliance with the principle of “substance over form” and particularly,
an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the Trial Measures if the following criteria are met at the same
time: (a) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated
financial statements for the most recent accounting year comes from PRC domestic companies, and (b) the main parts of the issuer’s
business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers
in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China; (2) exemptions from immediate
filing requirements for issuers that (a) have already been listed or registered but not yet listed in foreign securities markets, including
U.S. markets, prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures, (b) are not required to re-perform the regulatory procedures with the
relevant overseas regulatory authority or the overseas stock exchange, and (c) whose such overseas securities offering or listing shall
be completed before September 30, 2023, provided however that such issuers shall carry out filing procedures as required if they conduct
refinancing or are involved in other circumstances that require filing with the CSRC; (3) a negative list of types of issuers banned from
listing or offering overseas, such as (a) issuers whose listing or offering overseas has been recognized by the State Council of the PRC
as a possible threat to national security, (b) issuers whose affiliates have been recently convicted of bribery and corruption, (c) issuers
under ongoing criminal investigations, and (d) issuers under major disputes regarding equity ownership; (4) issuers’ compliance
with web security, data security, and other national security laws and regulations; (5) issuers’ filing and reporting obligations,
such as the obligation to file with the CSRC after it submits an application for initial public offering to overseas regulators, and the
obligation after offering or listing overseas to report to the CSRC material events including a change of control or voluntary or forced
delisting of the issuer; and (6) the CSRC’s authority to fine both issuers and their shareholders between 1 and 10 million RMB for
failure to comply with the Trial Measures, including failure to comply with filing obligations or committing fraud and misrepresentation.
We believe we are not required to obtain approvals
from any PRC government authorities, including the CSRC or the CAC, or any other government entity, to issue our securities to foreign
investors and to list on a U.S. exchange or to search for a target company. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not received
any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions or regulatory objection to the IPO from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. However,
applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations of the PRC may change or we could be mistaken about these rules applicability, and the
relevant PRC government agencies could reach a different conclusion and may subject us to a stringent approval process from the relevant
government entities in connection with the IPO, continued listing on a U.S. exchange, the potential business combination, the issuance
of shares or the maintenance of our status as a publicly listed company outside China, and the post business combination entity’s
PRC operations if our business combination target is a PRC company. If the CSRC or the CAC, or any other governmental or regulatory body
subsequently determines that its approval is needed for the IPO, a business combination, the issuance of our ordinary shares upon exercise
of the rights, or maintaining our status as a publicly listed company outside China, we may face approval delays, adverse actions or sanctions
by the CSRC, CAC and/or other PRC regulatory agencies. It is uncertain whether we will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government
to continue to list on a U.S. exchange in the future and offer our securities to foreign investors. If approval is required in the future,
including pursuant to the Trial Measures, and we are denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges or offer our
securities to foreign investors, we may not be able to continue listing on a U.S. exchange or be subject to other severe consequences,
which would materially affect our ability to complete a business combination in which case we may have to liquidate which would be adverse
to the interests of the investors. In addition, any changes in PRC law, regulations, or interpretations may severely affect our operations
after the IPO. The use of the term “operate” and “operations” includes the process of searching for a target business
and conducting related activities. To that extent, we may not be able to conduct the process of searching for a potential target company
in China.
12
On the other hand, although we are not required
to obtain approvals from any PRC government authorities to issue our securities to foreign investors and to list on a U.S. exchange or
to search for a target company, United Hydrogen, our current target in the proposed Business Combination, is required to complete filing
procedures with the CSRC in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination and listing of Pubco’s ordinary shares,
since United Hydrogen and its subsidiaries generated over 50% of each of their
revenue, net income, total assets, and net assets from the PRC within the most recent completed fiscal year. United Hydrogen made
the required filings under the Trial Measures with the CSRC on August 12, 2024. The CSRC has been reviewing United Hydrogen’s materials
since August 12, 2024, and has required United Hydrogen to provide supplementary materials on several occasions. As of the date of this
Annual Report, United Hydrogen has submitted supplementary materials in accordance with the CSRC’s requirements and is awaiting
further review. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the timing and content of
the CSRC’s review, United Hydrogen cannot predict the exact timing and the outcome of obtaining the CSRC filing notice. For
more details, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form F-4, as amended (File Number 333-284430), which was initially filed with
the SEC by United Hydrogen Group Inc. on January 23, 2024.
Our
Sponsor
Our
Sponsor is Aimei Investment Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted company whose ultimate beneficial owner is Ms. Huang Han. Ms. Han is a resident
of the PRC. The Sponsor has no business operations and only serves as a vehicle that holds equity interests in our Company. As of the
date of this Annual Report, we do not have any other promoters other than the Sponsor and its affiliate.
The
Sponsor holds an aggregate of 1,905,000 Ordinary Shares as of the date of this Annual Report. The Sponsor has invested an aggregate of
$3,345,000 in our Company, comprised of (i) $25,000 for 1,725,000 founder shares (approximately $0.014 per share), which were issued
to the Sponsor prior to our IPO (the “Founder Shares”), of which 152,000 Founder Shares were transferred to the then-officers
and directors of our Company on May 25, 2023, and (ii) $3,320,000 for 332,000 Private Units.
Status
as a Public Company
We
believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed
company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses
will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial
public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than
a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and
the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always
subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering
from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management
incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can offer
further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management
staffs.
13
Effecting
Our Initial Business Combination
We
are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the IPO. We intend
to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement of the Private Units,
new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth,
which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate
our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
If
our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account
are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Ordinary
Shares, we may apply the cash released to us from the Trust Account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes,
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We
may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than
using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing
only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets
other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose
the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the rules of Nasdaq, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing.
There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.
At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds
through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Selection
of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
Subject
to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair
market value of at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest
earned) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility
in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business
combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial
business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target or are otherwise not required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. There is no basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any
target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business
combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected
by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular
target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In
evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available
to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although
we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
14
The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target
business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available
to otherwise complete a business combination.
Lack
of Business Diversification
For
an indefinite period of time after the consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely
on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with
multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate
the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack
of diversification may:
●
subject
us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the
particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
●
Cause
us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or a limited number of products or services.
Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although
we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial
business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future
role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members
of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary
skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors
will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team
may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may
not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel
will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following
our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business.
We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or
experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
In
connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at
a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for
or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the
Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender
offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit
in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the business
combination and subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured
so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision
as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to
us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the
transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Unlike other blank check
companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and
related redemptions of Public Shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required
by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule
13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with
the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required
under the SEC’s proxy rules. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will consummate our initial
business combination only if we obtain an affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting
of the company.
15
If
we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition
or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial business combination,
we may be forced to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not
be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable
time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 12 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 24 months from
the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time, as described
in more detail in this report) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
Our
Initial Shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of any proposed
business combination, (2) not to redeem any Ordinary Shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business
combination and (3) not sell any Ordinary Shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
None
of our officers, directors, Initial Shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or Ordinary Shares
from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a general meeting to approve a proposed business combination
and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or to redeem
their shares, our officers, directors, Initial Shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private
transactions in order to increase the likelihood of satisfying the necessary closing conditions to such transaction. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, our officers, directors, Initial Shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of Ordinary Shares if the purchases
would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s
stock, shares or other equity securities.
Redemption
Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including
interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of the then issued and outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described
herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.10 per share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors
who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Initial
Shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
within the requisite time period. However, if our Initial Shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires Public
Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such Public Shares if we fail
to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.
Manner
of Conducting Redemptions
At
any general meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless
of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less
any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Ordinary
Shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
16
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a
“group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect
to 20% or more of the shares sold in the IPO. Such a public shareholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination
with respect to all shares owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent shareholders from accumulating large
blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the redemption right as a means to
force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a shareholder’s
ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of shareholders
to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction that is favored by our other public shareholders.
Our
Initial Shareholders, officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any Ordinary Shares owned by them, directly
or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the IPO or purchased by them in the IPO or in the aftermarket.
We
may require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender
their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository
Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth
in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether
or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking
to exercise redemption rights to deliver their shares prior to a specified date. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising
redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking
to exercise redemption rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed
business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
Any
proxy solicitation materials we furnish to shareholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate
whether we require shareholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the
time the shareholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his
shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction.
However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held
in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his
shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this
fact. Please see those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our filings from time to time with the
SEC.
Any
request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration
of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of Public Shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption
and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent
return the certificate (physically or electronically).
If
the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their
redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account as of two business
days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public
holders.
17
Permitted
Purchases of Our Securities by Our Affiliates
If
we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Initial Shareholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such
a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer
the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Initial Shareholders,
directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already
elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their
shares. Although very unlikely, our Initial Shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so
that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of Public Shares held by non-affiliates.
The
purpose of such purchases would be to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net
worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise
not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Further,
any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject
to such reporting requirements.
In
addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Ordinary Shares and the number of beneficial holders of our
securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on
a national securities exchange.
We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers: (a) would purchase the Public Shares
at a price no higher than the price offered through our redemption process; (b) would represent in writing that such Public Shares will
not be voted in favor of approving the business combination; and (c) would waive in writing any redemption rights with respect to the
Public Shares so purchased.
To
the extent any such purchases by our Initial Shareholders or any of their respective affiliates are made in situations in which the tender
offer rules’ restrictions on purchases apply, we will disclose such sales, in a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the security
holder meeting to approve the business combination transaction.
Redemption
of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
We
have a period of 12 months from the closing of our IPO to consummate our initial business combination and thereafter, if we require additional
time to consummate our initial business combination, our board of directors may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination
up to 12 times, each by an additional one-month period (for a total of up to 24 months to complete a business combination), subject to
the authorization by our board of directors and the deposit of additional funds into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates
or designees as described elsewhere in this Annual Report. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the
allotted time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), pro
rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This
redemption of public shareholders from the Trust Account shall be effected as required by function of our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
Our
Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to consummate our initial
business combination within the applicable period from the closing of the IPO. However, if our Initial Shareholders, or any of our officers,
directors or affiliates acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such Public
Shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights
or liquidating distributions with respect to our Rights, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business
combination within the allotted time period.
18
If
we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into
account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution
would be approximately $10.10. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced
by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however,
become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual
per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.10, plus interest (net of any taxes payable, and less up to
$50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses).
Although
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit
of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee (i) that they will execute such agreements, or (ii) even if they execute such agreements,
that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach
of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in
order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party
refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis
of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management
believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request
of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses
refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target businesses that we might pursue. Our independent registered
public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor will the
underwriters of the IPO.
Examples
of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant
whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would
agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition,
there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of,
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect
the amounts held in the trust account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor
for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction
agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below $10.10 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a
waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters
of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed
to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
However, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our officers or directors will
indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have
not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. We therefore believe it is
unlikely our Sponsor would be able to satisfy its indemnity obligations if it was required to do so. However, we believe the likelihood
of our Sponsor having to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses
as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in
the Trust Account.
In
the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below $10.10 per share and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy
any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would
determine whether to take legal action to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf to enforce such indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors
in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the
actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.10 per share.
19
If
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed,
the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy
or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any
bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public
shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed
against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or
bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer”, a “fraudulent conveyance”, a “fraud
in anticipation of winding up”, a “transaction in fraud of creditors” or a “misconduct in the course of winding
up”. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore,
our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby
exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing
the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our
public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of a redemption of the Public Shares
prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the allotted time period, (ii) if they
redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection
with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing
of our obligation to allow redemption rights or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within the allotted time period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination
activity. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting
in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable
pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
Competition
In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from
other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital
funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited
by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the
value of the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of the agreement
to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption
rights and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors
may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
We
currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but
they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination.
The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial
business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination.

additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4 filed with the SEC on December
5, 2023.

Item
1C. Cybersecurity.
We
are a blank check company with no business operations. Since the IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating
suitable acquisition transaction candidates. Therefore, we do not consider that we face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted
any cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk. We depend on the digital technologies
of third parties, and any sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, systems or infrastructure or the cloud that
we utilize, including those of third parties, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and
sensitive or confidential data and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or reputation. Because of
our reliance on the technologies of third parties, we also depend upon the personnel and the processes of third parties to protect against
cybersecurity threats, and we have no personnel or processes of our own for this purpose. As an early-stage company without significant
investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We also lack sufficient resources
to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these
occurrences, or a combination of them, could have material adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.
Our
board of directors is generally responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, if there is any. Our management will
promptly report to the board of directors on incidents of material cybersecurity risks facing us and any third parties and the measures
that may be taken to mitigate such risks. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not encountered any cybersecurity incidents that
have materially affected, or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, including our business strategy, results
of operations or financial condition. We do, however, face risks from cybersecurity threats.
Item
2. Properties.
Our
executive offices are located at 10 East 53rd Street, Suite 3001, New York, NY 10022, and our telephone number is 86-13758131392.
The
Sponsor has agreed, commencing from the date that our securities were first listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”),
through the earlier of our consummation of an initial business combination and our liquidation, to make available to us certain general
and administrative services, including office space, utilities, and administrative services, as we may require from time to time. We
have agreed to pay to the Sponsor, $10,000 per month, for up to 12 months, subject to extension to up to 24 months, for such administrative
services. As of December 31, 2024, the unpaid balance was $120,000, which was included in amount due to related party balance.
We
consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our
current operations.
Item
3. Legal Proceedings.
We
may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations, and claims incidental to the conduct of our business from time to time. We are not
currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding,
investigation or claim that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
or results of operations.

Holders
of Record
As
of March 28, 2025 there were 6,121,733 ordinary shares issued and outstanding held by approximately 10 shareholders of record, and there
were 1,905,000 ordinary shares issued and outstanding held by the Sponsor. The number of record holders was determined from the records
of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of shares of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various
security brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.
Dividend
Policy
We
have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an
initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenue and earnings, if any, capital
requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent
to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board
of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate
declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate
declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may
be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited
financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking
statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
including those set forth under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors”
and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We
are a blank check company newly incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability for the purpose of entering
into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with
one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. Our efforts
to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.
Proposed
United Hydrogen Business Combination
On
June 19, 2024, Aimei Health entered into the Business Combination Agreement for a business combination with (i) United Hydrogen, (ii)
Pubco, (iii) the First Merger Sub; (iv) the Second Merger Sub; and (v) the Sponsor. The
Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the consummation of the Closing,
including: (i) by mutual written consent of Aimei Health and United Hydrogen; (ii) by either Aimei Health or United Hydrogen if any law
or governmental order (other than a temporary restraining order) is in effect that permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise
prohibits the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) by either Aimei Health or
United Hydrogen if any of the conditions to Closing have not been satisfied or waived by March 31, 2025; (iv) by either Aimei Health
or United Hydrogen upon a material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the Business
Combination Agreement by the other party if such breach gives rise to a failure of certain closing conditions to be satisfied and cannot
or has not been cured within the earlier of 20 days’ following the receipt of notice from the non-breaching party and the Termination
Date; (v) by either Aimei Health or United Hydrogen if the Aimei Health shareholder approval is not obtained at its shareholder meeting;
(vi) by Aimei Health if the United Hydrogen shareholder approval is not obtained within ten (10) business days after the Registration
Statement becomes effective; or (vii) by Aimei Health, if the Reorganization (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) is not
completed by December 31, 2024. The Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in our Current Report
on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024.
Results
of Operations
We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Our only activities from inception to December 31, 2024 were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for and conduct the IPO, and those required to identify and evaluate a target company
for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our initial business combination,
at the earliest. We have generated and will continue to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash in bank
and investments held in the Trust Account established for the benefit of our public shareholders, from the proceeds derived from the
IPO. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as
well as for due diligence expenses.
For
the year ended December 31, 2024, we had a net income of $2,552,215, which consisted of interest income earned on investments held in
the Trust Account of $3,617,001, offset by formation and operational costs of $1,064,786.
For
the period from April 27, 2023 (inception) to December 31, 2023, we had a net income of $171,389, which consisted of interest income
earned on investments held in the Trust Account of $199,848, offset by formation and operational costs of $28,459.
23
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2024, we had $28,208 in our operating bank account, $73,784,549 in our Trust Account, and working capital deficit of
approximately $786,610.
Our
liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain
offering costs on our behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares, and the borrowing of approximately $210,151 from the Sponsor
under an unsecured promissory note (see “Note 5—Related Party Transactions” in the notes to our financial statements).
We have repaid the unsecured promissory note in full on December 7, 2023. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, our liquidity has
been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) held outside of
the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate
of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as
defined in “Note 5—Related Party Transactions” in the notes to our financial statements). As of December 31, 2024,
there were no amounts outstanding under the Working Capital Loans.
Based
on the foregoing, management believes that we will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet our anticipated cash
needs prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business
combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination,
in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. However, we cannot provide
any assurance that new financing will be available. Over the time period prior to our initial business combination, we will be using
the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business
combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target
business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination.
Going
Concern Consideration
In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15,
“Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined
that if we are unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of
our IPO, the requirement that we cease all operations, redeem the public shares, and thereafter liquidate and dissolve, raises substantial
doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which contemplate the continuation of our Company as a going concern.
Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements
We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2024. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual
Obligations
We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriter is entitled
to a deferred fee of one percent (1.0%) of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon closing of the Business Combination, or $690,000. The deferred
fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms
of the underwriting agreement.

Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of December
31, 2024, there were no critical accounting policies or estimates.
Recent
Accounting Standards
In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable
Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses
that are regularly provided to the chief operating officer decision maker (“CODM”), as well as the aggregate amount of other
segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU requires that a public entity disclose the title and
position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance
and deciding how to allocate resources. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently required by Topic
280 in interim periods, and entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments
in this ASU and existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our audited financial statements.
Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
As
a smaller report company, we are not required to provide
the information required by this item.
Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
This
information appears following Item 15 of this Annual Report and is included herein by reference.
Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of
December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Management’s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that:
(1)
pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of our company,
(2)
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
and
(3)
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2024. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management
determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
due to the material weakness in our internal controls as a result of inadequate segregation of duties within accounting processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record
keeping.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report by our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting
company, our management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No
changes occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
Item
9B. Other Information.
None.
Item
9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.

Director
Independence
Nasdaq
requires that a majority of our board must be composed of “independent directors,” which is defined generally as a person
other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion
of the company’s board of directors would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out
the responsibilities of a director.
Lin
Bao, Robin H. Karlsen and Julianne Huh are our independent directors. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings
at which only independent directors are present. Any affiliated transactions will be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained
from independent parties. Any affiliated transactions must be approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors.
Executive
Officer and Director Compensation
No
compensation will be paid to our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence
on suitable business combinations. Our independent directors will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Initial
Shareholders, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.
After
the completion of our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us, may be paid consulting, management,
or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommenced, to
the board of directors for determination, either by a committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent
directors on our board of directors.
We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not a party to any
agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.
Committees
of the Board of Directors
Audit
Committee
We
have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Lin Bao, Robin H. Karlsen, and Julianne Huh serve as members of our audit
committee. Lin Bao chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three
members of the audit committee all of whom must be independent. Lin Bao, Robin H. Karlsen and Julianne Huh are independent.
29
Member
of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Lin Bao qualifies as an “audit committee
financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.
Responsibilities
of the audit committee include:
●
the
appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm
and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;
●
pre-approving
all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm or any other registered public
accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;
●
reviewing
and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate
their continued independence;
●
setting
clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm;
●
setting
clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
●
obtaining
and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing the independent auditor’s
internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer
review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within, the preceding
five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;
●
reviewing
and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC
prior to us entering into such transaction; and
●
reviewing
with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory
or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published
reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting
standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
Compensation
Committee
The
members of our Compensation Committee are Lin Bao, Robin H. Karlsen, and Julianne Huh. Dr. Julianne Huh chairs the compensation committee.
We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which detail the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:
●
reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation,
evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the
remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation in executive session at which the Chief Executive Officer
is not present;
●
reviewing
and approving the compensation of all of our other officers;
●
reviewing
our executive compensation policies and plans;
●
implementing
and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;
●
assisting
management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;
●
approving
all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;
●
producing
a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and
●
reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.
30
The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser.
However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation
committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.
Nominating
Committee
Our
nominating committee consists of Lin Bao, Robin H. Karlsen, and Julianne Huh, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq’s
listing standards. Robin H. Karlsen chairs the nominating committee. The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection
of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee considers persons identified by its members,
management, shareholders, investment bankers and others.
Guidelines
for Selecting Director Nominees
The
guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in the Nominating Committee Charter, generally provide that persons to be nominated:
●
should
have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service;
●
should
possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and bring
a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and
●
should
have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the shareholders.
The
Nominating Committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background, integrity
and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require
certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and
will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating
committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons.
Code
of Conduct and Ethics
We
have adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers, and employees in accordance with applicable federal
securities laws. We filed a copy of our form of Code of Ethics and our audit committee charter as exhibits to the registration statement
in connection with our IPO. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC’s web site at
www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose
any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. See “Where You Can
Find Additional Information.”
Compensation
Recovery and Clawback Policies
Under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in the event of misconduct that results in a financial restatement that would have reduced a previously paid
incentive amount, we can recoup those improper payments from our executive officers. The SEC also recently adopted rules which direct
national stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement policies intended to recoup bonuses paid to executives if we are found
to have misstated its financial results.
We
have adopted a compensation recovery policy (the “Clawback Policy”) effective as of November 30, 2023 that complies with
the Nasdaq’s new clawback rules promulgated under the SEC’s Rule 10D-1.
The
Clawback Policy provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from our current and former executive
officers as defined in the Rule (“Covered Executives”) in the event that we are required to prepare an accounting restatement
due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. The recovery of such compensation
applies regardless of whether a Covered Executive engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement of an accounting
restatement. Under the Clawback Policy, our board of directors may recoup from the Covered Executives erroneously awarded incentive compensation
received within a lookback period of the three completed fiscal years preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting
restatement.
The
foregoing description of the Clawback Policy does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions
of the Clawback Policy, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 97.1 to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference.
31
Conflicts
of Interest
Under
Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:
●
duty
to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;
●
duty
to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose;
●
directors
should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;
●
duty
not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests;
and
●
duty
to exercise independent judgment.
In
addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement
to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill, and experience that may reasonably be expected of a
person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill
and experience which that director has.
As
set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing,
or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be
forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by
way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval
at general meetings.
Accordingly,
as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business
opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise when our board evaluates
a particular business opportunity with respect to the above-listed criteria. We cannot assure you that any of the above-mentioned conflicts
will be resolved in our favor. Furthermore, each of our officers and directors currently has and may in the future have fiduciary obligations
to other businesses, including other blank check companies similar to our company, of which they are now or may in the future be officers
or directors. To the extent they identify business opportunities which may be suitable for the entities to which they owe fiduciary obligations,
our officers and directors will honor those fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, it is possible they may not present opportunities to
us that otherwise may be attractive to us unless the entities to which they owe fiduciary obligations and any successors to such entities
have declined to accept such opportunities.
In
order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors
has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of a business combination, our liquidation or such
time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity,
any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations
he might have.

To
further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated
with any of our Initial Shareholders, officers, or directors unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, and the approval of a majority of our disinterested independent
directors that the business combination is fair to our company (or shareholders) from a financial point of view. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, subject to fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands
law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered
to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually
permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
Our
officers and directors, as well as our Initial Shareholders, have agreed, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with
us, (i) to vote any Founder Shares and Private Shares held by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (ii) not to redeem
such shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or any amendment to our charter
documents prior to the consummation of our initial business combination or sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with
a proposed initial business combination.
33
Limitation
on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
Cayman
Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification
of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public
policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provides for indemnification of our (former and existing) officers and directors (“Indemnified
Persons”) to the maximum extent permitted by law against all actions, proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred or sustained in or about the conduct of the company’s business or affairs or in the execution or discharge
of the Indemnified Person’s duties, powers, authorities or discretions. This includes all costs, expenses, losses or liabilities
incurred by the Indemnified Person in defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
proceedings (whether threatened, pending or completed) concerning the company or its affairs in any court or tribunal, whether in the
Cayman Islands or elsewhere. However, no Indemnified Person shall be indemnified in respect of any matter arising out of his own actual
fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We may purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that
insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures
us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.
Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
Item
11. Executive Compensation.
Employment
Agreements
We
have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon
termination of employment.
Executive
Officers and Director Compensation
No
executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including any finder’s
fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors
or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate,
the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will
be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments
that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination
will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect
to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.
Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None
of our officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one
or more officers serving on our board of directors.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Ordinary
Shares
Prior
to the IPO, we issued an aggregate of 50,000 ordinary shares of $1.00 par value each to Han Huang, who is the director of our Sponsor.
On May 11, 2023, Han Huang transferred those ordinary shares to the Sponsor and, on May 15, 2023, the Sponsor resolved to sub-divide
the ordinary shares of $1.00 par value each into ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each and, as a result, the Sponsor held 500,000,000
ordinary shares of $0.0001 each. On May 15, 2023, the directors resolved to repurchase 498,562,500 ordinary shares from the Sponsor,
the repurchase resulting in the Sponsor holding 1,437,500 ordinary shares. On May 25, 2023, 1,437,500 Founder Shares were issued to the
Sponsor pursuant to a securities subscription agreement. Simultaneously, the 1,437,500 ordinary shares previously held by the Sponsor
were repurchased by us. These share transactions have been retroactively adjusted.
As
of May 8, 2023, $25,000 was included as a subscription receivable. On September 15, 2023, we received $25,000 from the Sponsor in cash.
The Sponsor transferred 152,000 of those ordinary shares among our then-chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and three independent
directors at their original purchase price pursuant to executed securities assignment agreements, effective as of May 25, 2023.
On
October 20, 2023, we capitalized an amount equal to $28.75 standing to the credit of the share premium account and appropriated such
sum and applied it on behalf of the Sponsor towards paying up in full (as to the full par value of $0.0001 per Founder Share) 287,500
unissued ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value, and allotted such shares credited as fully paid to the Sponsor, resulting in 1,725,000
shares being issued and outstanding. 225,000 shares of such ordinary shares are not subject to forfeiture as the underwriters’
over-allotment was exercised in full.
Subject
to certain limited exceptions, the Initial Shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell their Founder Shares until six months
after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to initial business combination, we
consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the shareholders having
the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.
36
Promissory
Note — Related Party
On
May 1, 2023, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to us, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount
of $750,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the IPO. The note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December
31, 2023, (ii) the consummation of the IPO, or (iii) the date on which we determine to not proceed with the IPO. As of December 6, 2023,
we had borrowed $210,151 under the promissory note with the Sponsor. This promissory note was fully repaid on December 7, 2023. There
was no balance due as of December 31, 2024.
Extensions
Loan — Related Party
On December 11, 2024 and January 13, 2025, the
Sponsor and United Hydrogen caused the first and second monthly extension fee of $227,700 (equivalent to $0.033 per Public Share), respectively,
to be deposited into the Trust Account, to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination from December 6, 2024
to February 6, 2025. On February 6, 2025, March 6, 2025, April 4, 2025, May 6, 2025, June 6, 2025, July 6, 2025, and August 6, 2025, the
Sponsor and United Hydrogen caused the third through nineth monthly extension fee of $150,000, respectively, to be deposited into the
Trust Account, to further extend the deadline from February 6, 2024 to September 6, 2025. The deposit of the first through nineth monthly
extension fee is evidenced by an unsecured promissory note (each, a “Monthly Extension Promissory Note”). The first and second
Monthly Extension Promissory Notes are in the principal amount of $227,700 each, shared equally between the Sponsor and United Hydrogen
($113,850 each). The third through nineth Monthly Extension Promissory Notes are in the principal amount of $150,000, also shared equally
between the Sponsor and United Hydrogen ($75,000 each). Each Monthly Extension Promissory Note bears no interest and is payable in full
upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The Sponsor and United Hydrogen have the right, but not the obligation, to convert
the Monthly Extension Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into our private units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, each consisting of
one ordinary share and one right to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one ordinary share of our Company, immediately prior to the consummation
of the Business Combination, by providing us with written notices of their intention to convert the Monthly Extension Promissory Note
at least two business days prior to the closing of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the note payable balance
was $227,700 and $0, respectively.
Administrative
Services Arrangement
The
Sponsor has agreed, commencing from the date that our securities were first listed on Nasdaq, through the earlier of our consummation
of an initial business combination and our liquidation, to make available to us certain general and administrative services, including
office space, utilities, and administrative services, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay to the Sponsor, $10,000
per month, for up to 12 months, subject to extension to up to 24 months, for such administrative services. As of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the unpaid balance was $120,000 and $0, respectively, which was included in amount due to related party balance.
Related
Party Loans
In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor, the affiliates of the Sponsor, or our officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, make loans from time to time to us to fund certain capital requirements (“Working
Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation
of a business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation
of a business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that a business combination does
not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in
the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no amounts outstanding
under any Working Capital Loans.
37
Due
to Related Company
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a total amount due to related company of $289,780 and $0, from a related party, respectively,
for the payment of costs related to general and administrative services, the Initial Public Offering, and administrative services agreement.
The balance of which $50,000 was deposited in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2024 for the January 13, 2025 extension payment. The
balance is unsecured, interest-free and has no fixed terms of repayment.
Related
Party Policy
All
ongoing and future transactions between us and any member of our management team or his or her respective affiliates will be on terms
believed by us at that time, based upon other similar arrangements known to us, to be no less favorable to us than are available from
unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention to obtain estimates from unaffiliated third parties for similar goods or services to
ascertain whether such transactions with affiliates are on terms that are no less favorable to us than are otherwise available from such
unaffiliated third parties. If a transaction with an affiliated third party were found to be on terms less favorable to us than with
an unaffiliated third party, we would not engage in such transaction.
We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders, officers
or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Initial Shareholders,
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company (or
shareholders) from a financial point of view.
Director
Independence
Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. For a description of the director independence, see
“—Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services.
The
following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to MaloneBailey, LLP, or MaloneBailey, for services rendered.
Audit

services that are normally provided by MaloneBailey in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by MaloneBailey
for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in
our required filings with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the period from April 27, 2023 (inception) through December
31, 2023 totaled $160,000 and $115,000, respectively. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance
at audit committee meetings.
Audit-Related
Fees. Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance
of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” These services include attest
services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We
did not pay MaloneBailey for consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards for the period for the year ended
December 31, 2024 and for the period from April 27, 2023 (inception) through December 31, 2023.
Tax
Fees. We did not pay MaloneBailey for tax planning and tax advice for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the period from April

All
Other Fees. We did not pay MaloneBailey for other services for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the period from April 27,
2023 (inception) through December 31, 2023.
Pre-Approval
Policy.
Our
audit committee was formed in connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement for our IPO. As a result, the audit committee
did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were
approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has
and will pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and
terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by
the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Aimei Health Technology Co., Ltd.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Aimei Health Technology Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of
operations, changes in shareholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and for the period from April
27, 2023 (inception) through December 31, 2023 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2024 and December 31, 203, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and for the
period from April 27, 2023 (inception) through December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Going Concern Matter
The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s
business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease
all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Aimei
Health Technology Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April 27, 2023.
The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Although there is no restriction or limitation
on what industry its target operates in, it is the Company’s intention to pursue prospective targets that are focused on healthcare
innovation. The Company anticipates targeting what are traditionally known as “small cap” companies domiciled in North America,
Europe and/or the Asia Pacific regions that are developing assets in the biopharmaceutical, medical technology/medical device and diagnostics
space which aligns with its management team’s experience in operating health care companies and in drug and device technology development
as well as diagnostic and other services.
As
of December 31, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activities through December 31, 2024 related to the Company’s
formation and the Initial Public Offering (as defined below). Since the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s activity has been
limited to the evaluation of business combination candidates. The Company will not generate any operating revenue until after the completion
of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on
cash in bank and assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The
Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the
Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
The
Company’s sponsor is Aimei Investment Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement
for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 30, 2023. On December 6, 2023, the Company consummated
its Initial Public Offering of 6,900,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units
being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, which includes full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option of 900,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $69,000,000 (the “Initial Public Offering”), and incurring offering
costs of $2,070,665 and $690,000 for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 7). The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option
to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 6, 2023,
the over-allotment option was exercised in full.
Simultaneously
with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 332,000 units
(the “Private Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $3,320,000 (the “Private
Placement”). (see Note 4).
Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 6, 2023, an amount of $69,690,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust
account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i)
the consummation of a business combination, or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders,
as described below.
The
Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion
of its initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed business combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of
a business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of how
they vote for the business combination. If a vote is held to approve such an initial business combination, the Company will consummate
such initial business combination only if the Company has the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote
at a general meeting of the Company.
The
shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially
$10.10 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company
to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced
by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a business combination with respect to the Company’s rights.
F-7
AIMEI
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If
a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and
Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which regulate issuer tender offers,
and file tender offer documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) prior to completing its initial
business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is
required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
The
Sponsor has agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to redeem any shares
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or any amendment to the Company’s charter
prior to the consummation of its initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection
with any proposed business combination. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its business combination.
The
Company initially had 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public
Offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a business combination by up to 12 additional months through 12 one-month
extensions of time, as further provided in the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) to consummate
a business combination (the “Combination Period”). If the Company is unable to complete a business combination within the
Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible
but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining holders of ordinary shares and its board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution
of the Company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements
of applicable law.
The
underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds
held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is
possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the offering price per Unit ($10.00).
The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amounts in the Trust Account to below $10.10 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and
except as to any claims under its indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor
will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether
the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities
of the Company. The Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such obligations and therefore believes the Sponsor will be unlikely
to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. However, the Company believes the likelihood of the Sponsor having
to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because the Company will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as
well as other entities execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held
in the Trust Account.
On
June 19, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) for a business
combination with (i) United Hydrogen Group Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (“United
Hydrogen”), (ii) United Hydrogen Global Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (“Pubco”),
(iii) United Hydrogen Victor Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pubco (“First Merger Sub”); (iv) United Hydrogen Worldwide Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Second Merger Sub” and, together with Pubco and
First Merger Sub, each, individually, an “Acquisition Entity” and, collectively, the “Acquisition Entities”);
and (v) Aimei Investment Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company, in the capacity as, from and after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), the representative for the Company and its shareholders (the “Sponsor”).

AIMEI
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) First Merger Sub will merge with and into the United
Hydrogen (the “First Merger”), whereby the separate existence of First Merger Sub will cease, and United Hydrogen will be
the surviving corporation of the First Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco; and (ii) following confirmation of the effective
filing of the First Merger, and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, Second Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the “Second Merger”, and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), whereby the separate existence
of Second Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will be the surviving corporation of the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Pubco.
On
February 6, 2025, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Trust Agreement Amendment”) to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trusts Company (“Trustee”). Pursuant to the Trust Agreement Amendment, the
amount of funds to be deposited into the trust account managed by the Trustee (the “Trust Account”) in connection with extending
the timeframe within which the Company must consummate its initial business combination (“Extension”), is adjusted from $0.033
per each share sold in its IPO (the “Public Share”) (for each monthly extension) to an amount equal to $150,000 for all outstanding
Public Shares (for each monthly extension).
As
of the date of this report, the Company has extended four times by an additional one month each time, and so it now has until April 6,
2025 to consummate a business combination. Pursuant to the terms of the current amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
and the trust agreement between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in order to extend the time available
for the Company to consummate its initial business combination, the Company’s insiders or their affiliates or designees, must deposit
into the Trust Account $150,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On each of December 11, 2024 and January 13, 2025,
the Company has deposited $227,700 into the Trust Account in order to extend the amount of available time to complete a business combination
until February 6, 2025. On each of February 6, 2025 and March 6, 2025, the Company has deposited in an amount of $150,000 into the Trust
Account in order to extend the amount of available time to complete a business combination until April 6, 2025.

of December 31, 2024, the Company had $28,208 in its bank account, $73,784,549 in its Trust Account and working capital deficit of $747,377.
The
Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through (i) the payment of $25,000
from the Sponsor to cover certain offering costs on the Company’s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (see Note 5),
and (ii) a loan from the Sponsor of approximately $210,151 under the Note (as defined in Note 5). The Company has repaid the note in
full on December 7, 2023. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s liquidity has been satisfied
through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor,
or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as
defined in Note 5). As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan.
Over
the period of time to complete a business combination, the Company will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying
existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due diligence on
prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the business combination.

Going
Concern Consideration
In
connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management
has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and
thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern.
NOTE
2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
These
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging
growth company
The
Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory
vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable.
The
Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has
different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised
standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements
with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the
extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Use
of estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed as of the date of the financial statements, which management considered in
formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results
could differ significantly from those estimates.

Cash
and cash equivalents
The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash balance was
$28,208 and $580,717, respectively.
Cash
held in trust account
On
July 16, 2024, the Company instructed their trust custodian to liquidate their positions in marketable securities and invest 100% of
the trust account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account. As of December 31, 2024, all the assets held in the Trust Account were
held in an interest-bearing demand deposit account. As of December 31, 2023, substantially all the assets held in the Trust Account were
held in U.S. Treasury Bills. The Company accounts for its marketable securities under ASC 320, where securities are presented at fair
value on the balance sheets and with gains or losses, if any, presented on the statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the assets held in Trust Account was $73,784,549 and $69,889,848, respectively.
Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption
All
of the 6,900,000 ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for
the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer
in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity”, conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either
within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s
control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the
entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption
threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible
assets (shareholders’ equity) to be less than $5,000,001. However, the threshold in its charter would not change the nature of
the underlying shares as redeemable and thus Public Shares would be required to be disclosed outside of permanent equity. Accordingly,
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 6,900,000 and 6,900,000 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at the redemption amount, respectively,
were presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance
sheets.
Income
taxes
The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” (“ASC 740”)
which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in
future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.
ASC
740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company’s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company’s
major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income
tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and no amounts were accrued for interest and penalties
during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in
significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.
The
Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently
not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, there was no provision
for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Net
income per share
Net
income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. The
calculation of diluted loss per share does not consider the effect of the rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering
and rights issued as components of the Private Units (the “Private Rights”) since the issuance of shares underlying the rights
is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had not
experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. As of December
31, 2024 and 2023, $0 and $330,717 was not insured, respectively.
Fair
value of financial instruments
The
fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Level
1 — defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;
Level
2 — defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly
or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and
Level
3 — defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers
are unobservable.
In
some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In
those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The
following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December

Recent
issued accounting standards
In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments
in this ASU require disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief
operating officer decision maker (“CODM”), as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported
measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation
of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and
entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and existing
segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material

3 – INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On
December 6, 2023, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 6,900,000 Units (including the issuance of 900,000 Units as
a result of the underwriter’s full exercise of its over-allotment option), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $69,000,000.
Each Unit consists of one ordinary share and one right (“Public Right”). Each Public Right entitles the holder to receive
one-fifth (1/5) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, so the holder must hold
rights in multiples of 5 in order to receive shares for all of the rights upon closing of a business combination.
NOTE
4 – PRIVATE PLACEMENT
Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 332,000 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per
Private Unit ($3,320,000 in the aggregate).
The
proceeds from the sale of the Private Units will be added to the net proceeds from the Offering held in the Trust Account. The Private
Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that Private Units (including the Private Rights) will not
be transferable, assignable or saleable until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination except to permitted
transferees. If the Company does not complete a business combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the
Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private
Rights will expire worthless.
NOTE
5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Founder
Shares
Prior
to the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 50,000 ordinary shares of $1.00 par value each to Han Huang. On May
11, 2023, Han Huang transferred those ordinary shares to the Sponsor and on May 15, 2023, the Sponsor resolved to sub-divide the ordinary
shares of $1.00 par value each into ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each and as such the Sponsor held 500,000,000 ordinary shares
of $0.0001 each. On May 15, 2023, the directors resolved to repurchase 498,562,500 ordinary shares from the Sponsor, the repurchase resulting
in the Sponsor holding 1,437,500 ordinary shares. On May 25, 2023, 1,437,500 founder shares were issued to the Sponsor (up to 187,500
of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) pursuant
to a securities subscription agreement and the 1,437,500 ordinary shares previously held by the Sponsor were repurchased by the company,
the shares have been retroactively adjusted. On October 20, 2023, the Company capitalized an amount equal to $28.75 standing to the credit
of the share premium account and appropriated such sum and applied it on behalf of the Sponsor towards paying up in full (as to the full
par value of $0.0001 per founder share) 287,500 unissued ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value and allotted such shares credited as fully
paid to the Sponsor, resulting in 1,725,000 ordinary shares being issued and outstanding. 225,000 shares of such ordinary shares are
not subject to forfeiture as the underwriters’ over-allotment was exercised in full. The initial shareholders will collectively
own approximately 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the initial shareholders
do not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Units and underlying securities).
Subject
to certain limited exceptions, the initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell their founder shares until six months
after the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to initial business
combination, the Company consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all
of the shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.
Promissory
Note – Related Party
On
May 1, 2023, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) to the Company, pursuant to which the Company may
borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $750,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The Note
is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2023, (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, or
(iii) the date on which the Company determines to not proceed with the Initial Public Offering. These amounts were repaid upon completion
of the Initial Public Offering out of the $550,000 of Initial Public Offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of Initial
Public Offering expenses. As of December 6, 2023, the Company has borrowed $210,151 under the Note. The Note was fully repaid on December

Extensions
Loan – Related Party
The
Company will have to consummate a business combination by April 6, 2025. However, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able
to consummate a business combination within 12 months, the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination
up to twelve times by an additional one month each time to complete a business combination. Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s
memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, both as amended, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a business combination, the Sponsor
its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account the
applicable extension fees, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each extension. The Sponsor or its affiliates or designees
will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the
event that the Company are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so.
Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination or at the lender’s discretion,
converted upon consummation of the business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit.
On
December 11, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the amount of $227,700 to the Sponsor and United Hydrogen, pursuant
to which such amount had been deposited into the Trust Account in order to extend the amount of available time to complete a business
combination until January 6, 2025. The notes are non-interest bearing and are payable upon the closing of a business combination. In
addition, the notes may be converted, at the lender’s discretion, into additional Private Units at a price of $10.00 per unit.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the note payable balance was $227,700 and $0, respectively.

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Company’s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor,

shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On May 1, 2023, The Company entered into a subscription agreement for founder shares
with the Sponsor which is recorded as subscription receivable. The subscription agreement was amended and restated on May 24, 2023. Prior
to the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 50,000 ordinary shares of $1.00 par value each to Han Huang. On May
11, 2023, Han Huang transferred those ordinary shares to the Sponsor and on May 15, 2023, the Sponsor resolved to sub-divide the ordinary
shares of $1.00 par value each into ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each and as such the Sponsor held 500,000,000 ordinary shares
of $0.0001 each. On May 15, 2023, the directors resolved to repurchase 498,562,500 ordinary shares from the Sponsor, the repurchase resulting
in the Sponsor holding 1,437,500 ordinary shares. On May 25, 2023, 1,437,500 founder shares were issued to the Sponsor pursuant to a
securities subscription agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 (up to 187,500 of which are subject to forfeiture depending
on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) pursuant to a securities subscription agreement and
the 1,437,500 ordinary shares previously held by the Sponsor were repurchased by the Company, the shares having been retroactively adjusted.
As of May 8, 2023, $25,000 was included as a subscription receivable. On September 15, 2023, the Company received $25,000 in cash. The
Sponsor transferred 152,000 of those ordinary shares among the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three
independent director nominees at their original purchase price pursuant to executed securities assignment agreements, effective as of
May 25, 2023. On October 20, 2023, the Company capitalized an amount equal to $28.75 standing to the credit of the share premium account
and appropriated such sum and applied it on behalf of the Sponsor towards paying up in full (as to the full par value of $0.0001 per
founder share) 287,500 unissued ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value and allotted such shares credited as fully paid to the Sponsor,
resulting in 1,725,000 ordinary shares being issued and outstanding. 225,000 shares of such ordinary shares are not subject to forfeiture
as the underwriters’ over-allotment was exercised in full. The initial shareholders will collectively own approximately 20% of
the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the initial shareholders do not purchase
any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Units and underlying securities).
As
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of the closing of the Initial Public Offering and full exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option, there were 2,126,000 ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 6,900,000 ordinary shares subject to possible
redemption.
Rights
Each
holder of a right will receive one-fifth (1/5) of one ordinary share upon consummation of a business combination, even if the holder
of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a business combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange
of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares
upon consummation of a business combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the unit purchase price paid for
by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which the
Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share
consideration the holders of the ordinary share will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into ordinary share basis and each
holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/5th of one share underlying each right (without
paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held
by affiliates of the Company).
Additionally,
in no event will the Company be required to net cash to settle the rights. If the Company is unable to complete a business combination
within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any
of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the
Trust Account with respect to such rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.

in the Initial Public Offering may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective
date of the registration statement. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights on registration
statements filed after the Company’s consummation of a business combination; provided that any holder that is affiliated with an
underwriter participating in the Initial Public Offering may participate in a “piggy-back” registration only during the seven-year
period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement.
Representative
Shares
The
Company issued 69,000 ordinary shares to the representative (and/or its designees) (the “representative shares”) as part
of representative compensation as the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. The representative shares have been
deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the commencement
of sales in the Initial Public Offering pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110 (e)(1). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), these securities will
not be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the
securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the commencement of sales in the Initial Public Offering,
nor may they be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the commencement
of sales in the Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the offering and their officers,
partners, registered persons or affiliates.
Underwriter
Agreement
The
underwriters purchased 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments.
The
underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of: (i) two percent (2.00%) of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering,
or $1,380,000 as the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred
fee of one percent (1.0%) of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $690,000 as the underwriters’ over-allotment
is exercised in full upon closing of the business combination. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a business combination
from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. In addition, the Company has paid the
representative of the underwriters, at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, 1.00% of the gross proceeds in the Company’s
ordinary shares or 69,000 ordinary shares as the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full.
Right
of First Refusal
For
a period beginning on the closing of the Initial Public Offering and ending 12 months from the closing of a business combination, the
Company has granted Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, a right of first refusal to act as the sole investment banker, sole book running
manager and/or sole placement agent for any and all future private or public equity, equity-linked, convertible and debt offerings during
such period. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(6)(A), such right of first refusal shall not have a duration of more than three years

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
8 – SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC
Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statement information about
operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker,
or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The
Company’s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Financial Officer (“CODM”), who reviews the
operating results for the Company as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly,
management has determined that the Company only has one operating segment.
When
evaluating the Company’s performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics,
which includes general and administrative expenses and interest earned on assets held in Trust Account which are included in the accompanying
statements of operations.
The
key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM are earned on assets held in Trust Account and general and administrative
expenses. The CODM reviews earned on assets held in Trust Account to measure and monitor stockholder value and determine the most effective
strategy of investment with the Trust Account funds while maintaining compliance with the trust agreement. General and administrative
expenses are reviewed and monitored by the CODM to manage and forecast cash to ensure enough capital is available to complete a business
combination within the business combination period. The CODM also reviews general and administrative costs to manage, maintain and enforce
all contractual agreements to ensure costs are aligned with all agreements and budget.
