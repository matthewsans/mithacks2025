FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report
contains forward-looking statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
This report and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set out
anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have tried, wherever
possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar expressions in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future
actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings, and financial results.
We caution
that the factors described herein, and other factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect
the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible
for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent
to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

of businesses specializing in using advanced manufacturing to make advanced materials for energy and water production. With a strong
ESG focus the company is committed to establishing local manufacturing of tangible products for local markets.
In the energy space,
the company is leveraging its existing business and management’s core competency to reshore solar manufacturing. The initial target
markets are USA and Australia but exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia and Europe. A made locally approach.
The solar market
is growing strongly (>10% annual growth). In addition to its strong environmental credentials, solar is now the cheapest form of electricity
generation. The fundamental economics of solar are driving this market growth. With the market adoption, and price reductions, of short-term
battery storage, many solar and battery installations are completely independent of grid-based distribution. Solar is a mature, proven
technology.
During
Q1 in the USA alone a record 11GW of solar was installed. This accounted for 75% of new energy installations in America. Currently in
the US alone there are approximately 15GW of solar cell and panel manufacturing factories under construction. There are an additional
approximate 15GW of factories in planning. The solar market in the USA at present is very strong. A solar panel is made up of multiple
solar cells made from silicon wafers. At present 99% of all silicon wafers are made in China. US-based silicon wafer production and the
majority of cell and panel production ceased over a decade ago. As a result, China completely dominates solar manufacturing. All but
one of the new American based factories are relying on Chinese produced wafers for their production. GSTX plans to be one of the first
companies in production of American made silicon wafers during Q1/Q2 2026.
Silicon Wafer
Manufacturing
The solar supply
chain can be depicted as follows:
Quartz -> silicon
-> polysilicon -> silicon ingots -> silicon wafers -> solar cells -> solar modules (panels)
GSTX has established
a new, wholly owned, subsidiary, The Quartz & Silicon Materials Company Ltd (“QSM”) to hold its businesses involved in
the solar manufacturing sector. QSM is the parent company for:
•
Ausquartz Group Holdings (AUSQUARTZ) – An Australian based company with world class expertise in high purity quartz. Ausquartz operates a test and pilot production facility in Melbourne Australia. The company is successfully producing solar and semiconductor grade quartz sand.
•
Wafer Manufacturing Company (WMC) – A USA based company developing silicon wafer manufacturing operations for supplying downstream solar cell manufacturers. WMC is a joint venture with American Solar Manufacturing Corporation.
•
Southern Silicon – A New Zealand based company developing a silicon metal smelter and a polysilicon production plant on the South Island of New Zealand. These two facilities will utilise local resources and green (renewable) power.
QSM is in advanced
discussion with several large incumbent manufacturers to reshore manufacturing of silicon ingots, wafers and cells to the US and Australia.
QSM is structured to take advantage of the American “Inflation Reduction Act” and the Australian “Made in Australia”
programs to reshore critical solar manufacturing. Producing wafers locally (Made in America/Made in Australia) is key to being able to
claim government incentives (production credits). QSM is a low technology risk enterprise, no new inventions, just manufacturing.
Water Harvesting
Water scarcity is
at the center of the world’s most significant challenges. The United Nations estimates approximately 30% of the world’s population
will face severe water shortages by 2025. Many people do not realise that the atmosphere, the air we breathe, contains a significant
amount of water. Humidity is water in the air. Air can hold 1-2 ounces of water per cubic yard. At any one instant, the Earth’s
atmosphere contains 37.5 trillion gallons of water vapor – enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with 1.5 inches of
rain if condensed.
In parallel, massive
population growth and urbanisation has led to an unprecedented demand for fresh water. Investment in infrastructure has been woefully
inadequate, resulting in severe and critical water stress globally. There are an estimated 13 trillion litres (3.4 trillion gal) of water
floating in the atmosphere at any one time. There is 6 times as much fresh water in the air as in all rivers and lakes in the world.
5
The company maintains
a strong interest in the development of water harvesting products, however the current focus of the company is on development and commercialization
of its solar business.
To that end, the
company has temporarily paused these development activities to focus on establishing its solar manufacturing business.
Graphene Material
The company has a
strong interest in the downstream, commercial, applications of graphene. Unfortunately, the graphene sector has struggled to achieve
significant commercial adoption of its materials. In addition, the scalable, bulk, production of graphene is also yet to be achieved
at commercially economic levels. Graphene continues to show early stage promising technological improvements, but larger scale business
opportunities remain elusive. GSTX management remain active in the sector and believe that graphene has a commercial future, but at present
GSTX has paused actively developing its graphene opportunities. Graphene remains an interest of the company and continues to monitor
the sector. The company remains interested in bulk production of graphene for the additive markets.
US Thin Films
GSTX has recently
restructured its shareholding in US Thin-Film Corporation. GSTX is now a minority shareholder (19%) of US Thin-Film Corporation.
The company is presently
in discussions with several contract manufacturing groups to produce initial samples of its thin film technology, branded Dragonfly film,
for product qualification and pre-sales activity purposes.
Other areas of
interest
The Company
is also exploring acquisition opportunities for Critical Resource Assets (Minerals with identified supply chain risk), rare earth mineral
extraction, zero emission fossil fuel replacement, green hydrogen, and ammonia production.
Government
Product Approvals.
There are
no identified government approvals required for our products and no export restrictions for the products.
Effect
of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business.
Management
believes that there are no identified existing or probable government regulations that will adversely impact our business.
Management
believes that the proposed introduction/increase of import duties/tariffs on solar equipment and products from China and South East Asia
will benefit the proposed company operations in the US.
Research
and Development Activities.
The primary
research and development during the next fiscal year will involve further development and evaluation of new efficient material processing
techniques. The company plans to manufacture samples of its products for customer validation and presales activity purposes.
Compliance
with Environmental Laws.
Based upon
our long-term experience, management believes that the nature of our proposed processing operations does not involve any onerous environmental
compliance requirements. Compliance costs have been identified and quantified in the company plan of operations, business plan including
financial plan.
Employees.
Certain members
of our management team have been involved in this industry since 2005 and this has resulted in an experienced team of learned employees,
advisors and technical experts in various locations and capacities within both Australia, Central Europe, and in the United States. It
is planned to increase fulltime and part time employees/contractors from the present levels to a minimum of 30 within the next 12 months,
subject to the company securing additional funding.
At the present
time we rely upon experienced consultants with whom management has long-term relationships.
Executive
Management and Technical Team.
Our executive
management and technical team have largely co-worked together since 2005, and especially the last 5 years in Melbourne, Australia, China
and the USA. All the specialized human resources are available to us.

Holders of
our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is not restricted
from paying any dividends but is not obligated to declare a dividend. No cash dividends have ever been declared and it is not anticipated
that cash dividends will ever be paid.
Our Articles
of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 800,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. The provisions in the Articles of Incorporation relating to the preferred stock allow our directors to issue preferred stock with
multiple votes per share and dividend rights which would have priority over any dividends paid with respect to the holders of our common
stock. The issuance of preferred stock with these rights may make the removal of management difficult even if the removal would be considered
beneficial to shareholders, generally, and will have the effect of limiting shareholder participation in certain transactions such as
mergers or tender offers if these transactions are not favored by our management.
As of September
30, 2024, we had approximately 398 shareholders of record.
We have not
declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends on
our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth. Any future determination
to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations,
capital requirements and other factors the board of directors considers relevant.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following
discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related
notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K. Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements
that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements can be by their very nature, uncertain
and risky. Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements
can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking
statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise
interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Overview
In July
2017, the Company acquired Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a New Zealand corporation with substantial mineral resource and technical
engineering assets.
In September
2021, the Company through its 100% owned subsidiary, US Thin Film Corporation, acquired Specialty Material Group, Cayman Island corporation
who holds a significant group of invention and processing patents in making Nanoparticle conductive thin film material for various industrial
and technology applications.
We continue
to seek new financing in the form of equity, debt, or a combination thereof to meet further development and general operating obligations.
Achieving sufficient funds soon is of vital importance. The Company has managed to raise sufficient capital by sale of shares, but as
of September 30, 2024, the Company has not been successful in raising sufficient funds to maintain primary operations. However, substantial
efforts are underway to secure funding, and we believe that funding for the Company is imminent in the near future, although no assurance
can be made as to the amount of funds, if any, or the terms thereof.
Current
Business and Operation
The company has a
renewed focus and strategy to supply silicon wafers and solar cells for the photovoltaic manufacturing sector. This leverages the existing
company operations and upstream supply chain components (quartz sand, crucibles). The company is exploring partnerships with established
incumbent manufacturers to reshore production to the USA and Australia.
The Company
is actively recruiting new members of the management team to assist with implementing its strategic plan. The company is re-engaging
various opportunities that it was pursuing pre-pandemic.
Currently, GSTX is
primarily focused upon completing development and initial sample production of commercially viable silicon wafers and solar cells. The
goal for the FY 2025 is to establish initial production and begin generating revenue.

General Discussion.
Whereas
management has been successful in the past in raising capital, there are no assurances that these sources of financing will continue
to be available to us and/or that demand for our common stock will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be
available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business
opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing
efforts, any of which could have a negative impact on its business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require it to:
●
seek
joint venture partners;
●
monetize
its assets;
●
seek
arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require the company to relinquish significant rights to products,
technologies or markets; or
●
explore other strategic
alternatives, including a merger or sale of our company.
●
Cease
current operations
To the
extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may
result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities
may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on
our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet its operational needs, we may seek to compensate
providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
Inflation.
The impact
of inflation on our costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to its customers over time is dependent upon market conditions. We
are not aware of any inflationary pressures that have had any significant impact on its operations over the past quarter and we do not
anticipate that inflationary factors will have a significant impact on future operations.
Impact
of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Among other things, the IRA contained certain clean
energy incentives and initiatives. The Company operates in sectors that management believe will benefit from these initiatives.
Going
Concern and Management’s Liquidity Plans.
As reflected
in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30 2023, a net loss and net cash used in
operating activities for the year then ended and has generated no revenues since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements.
The ability
of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on management’s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt
and/or equity markets. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company’s
existence until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise any additional capital.
The Company
may also require additional funding to finance the growth of our anticipated future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives.
There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In that event, the
Company would be required to change its growth strategy and seek funding on that basis, if at all.
10
The Company’s
plan regarding these matters is to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow the Company the ability to cover its current
cash flow requirements and meet its obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will be available or if
available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms. In the event that the Company is unable to generate adequate
revenues to cover expenses and cannot obtain additional financing in the near future, the Company may seek protection under bankruptcy
laws. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements.
We do
not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment.
Critical
Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements.
The Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC has issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
Accounting Policies,” suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
In FRR 60, the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important
to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and
subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition,
our most critical accounting policies are set forth below. The methods, estimates, and judgments the company uses in applying these most
critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements.
A summary
of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows:
Stock-Based
Compensation – We account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value
attributable to stock options is calculated based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is amortized to expense over the service
period which is equivalent to the time required to vest the stock options.
Income
Taxes – Income taxes are provided based on the liability method for financial reporting purposes. Under this method deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Uncertain
tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax positions in income tax expense.
We are
required to file federal income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions. Our tax returns filed
since inception are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with the normal
statutes of limitations in the applicable jurisdiction.
Earnings
Per Share – Basic earnings per share have been calculated based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated based upon the weighted-average number of common and potential shares and is not presented
when anti-dilutive.
Financial
Instruments and Fair Value Measurements - As defined in ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements,” fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based
on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).
The Company
determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs
an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.
11
The Company’s
financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, and due to related parties. The carrying
amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.
Derivative
Financial Instruments - The Company accounts for freestanding contracts that are settled in a company’s own stock, including
common stock warrants, to be designated as an equity instrument or generally as a liability. A contract so designated is carried at fair
value on a company’s balance sheet, with any changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in a company’s results of operations.
The Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect any material changes
in fair value, with any such changes classified as changes in derivatives valuation in the statement of operations. The calculation of
the fair value of derivatives utilizes highly subjective and theoretical assumptions that can materially affect fair values from period
to period. The recognition of these derivative amounts does not have any impact on cash flows.
At the
date of the conversion of any convertible debt, the pro rata fair value of the related embedded derivative liability is transferred to
additional paid-in capital.
The Company
determines our derivative liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and uses the Binomial pricing model to calculate the fair
value. There are no derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Binomial model requires six basic data inputs: the
exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the stock
price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
The fair value of each convertible note is estimated using the Binomial valuation model.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Graphene & Solar Technologies Limited
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Graphene & Solar Technologies Limited (the Company) as of September
30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit, and cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-
year period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations, net cash used in operations,
and a lack of revenues to-date, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters
The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.
Going
Concern
As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations, net cash used in
operations, and a lack of revenues to-date.
Auditing
management’s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgement given the fact that the Company uses management estimates
on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated.
To
evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information that was the initial cause along
with management’s plans to mitigate going concern and management’s disclosure on going concern.

GRAPHENE &
SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 AND 2023
NOTE
1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These consolidated
financial statements of Graphene & Solar Technologies Limited (GSTX or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, these financial statements include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
Certain information, accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.
Going Concern
– The Company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception of $71,015,630
at September 30, 2024. Accordingly, it requires capital to
fund working capital deficits and for future operating activities to take place. The Company’s ability to raise new funds through
the future issuances of debt or common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of a plan
of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.
The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on management’s plans, which include the raising of capital
through debt and/or equity markets, with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until
such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional
liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company’s existence. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise any additional capital and therefore raise doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Future issuances
of the Company’s equity or debt securities will be required for the Company to finance operations and continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Going
Concern
The Company’s
consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenues from operations to
date and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has a stockholders’ deficit as of September 30, 2024.
Furthermore, the Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and has financed
its working capital requirements during this period primarily through the recurring sale of its equity securities.
As a result,
management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the consolidated financial statements are being issued. In addition, the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2024,
has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s
plan regarding these matters is to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow the Company the ability to cover its current
cash flow requirements and meet its obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will be available or if
available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms. In the event that the Company is unable to generate adequate
revenues to cover expenses and cannot obtain additional financing in the near future, the Company may seek protection under bankruptcy
laws. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary.
The spread of a novel
strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world from the first half of 2020 has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international
markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration.
F-7
The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its activities and to
ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profits. The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Because the
Company is currently engaged in an early stage of development, it may take a considerable amount of time to develop any product or intellectual
property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company’s business is unlikely to generate any sustainable
operating revenues in the next several years. In addition, to the extent that the Company is able to generate revenues through product
sales, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flows.
At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $1,845 available to fund its operations. The Company needs to raise additional capital during
the year ending September 30, 2025 to fund its ongoing business activities.
The amount
and timing of future cash requirements during the year ended September 30, 2025 will depend on the extent of financing the Company is
able to arrange. As market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to secure additional funds, there can be
no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue
to conduct operations. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company’s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would
be required to scale back or discontinue its technology and product development programs, or obtain funds, if available (although there
can be no certainty), through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its assets, or to discontinue
its operations entirely.
Intangible
Assets
We amortize
capitalized patent costs for internally generated patents on a straight-line basis for 7 years, which represents the estimated useful
lives of the patents. The seven-year estimated useful life for internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors
as: the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed, the overall makeup of the portfolio over time, and the length of license
agreements for such patents. The estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights, however, have been and will continue to
be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents.
The average estimated useful life of acquired patents is 6.7 years. We assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net
patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patent portfolio may not be recoverable.
Assumed
Liabilities
As a result
of the acquisition of Cima Specialty Materials Ltd (CSML) from CIMA Nanotech Holdings Limited, “CNHL”, (a Cayman Island Registered
company) the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary US Thin Film Corporation (USTFC) under the terms of the of the Share Sale and Purchase
agreement the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock for future liability settlement for assumed liabilities. The fair value
of these future assumed liabilities of $720,000 was recorded as a stock receivable.
Revenue recognition
Policies (ASC 606)
The Company recognizes
revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle
of ASC 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services ASC 606 requires companies to assess their contracts to determine
the timing and amount of revenue to recognize under the new revenue standard. The model has a five-step approach:
1.       Identify
the contract with the customer.
2.       Identify
the performance obligations in the contract.
3.       Determine
the total transaction price.
4.       Allocate
the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract.
5.       Recognize
as revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
Disclosure
of Rental Income
Rental income
is not recognized as ‘operating revenue” but as ‘other income’ during the period of $18,981.
F-8
NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of Consolidation
The consolidated
financial statements include the financial statements of Graphene and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Quartz and Silicon Materials
Company (“QSM”), Ausquartz Group Holdings (“AUS”), Wafer Manufacturing Corporation (“WMC”), Southland
Silicon Materials (“SSM”), Graphene and Solar Technologies Limited (“GSTXNZ”), and Adaquo, LLC (“ADQ”).
All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Basis
of Presentation
These accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America (“GAAP”).
Use
of Estimates
The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial
statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions
used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience, and
reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in accruals for potential liabilities, valuing
equity instruments issued for services, and the realization of deferred tax assets.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. As of
September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1,845 and $1,094 in cash, respectively, and no cash equivalents.
Financial
Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
As
defined in ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements,” fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes
market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and
the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally
unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).
F-9
The Company
determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs
an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.
The Company’s
financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, and due to related parties. The carrying
amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.
Derivative
Financial Instruments
The Company
accounts for freestanding contracts that are settled in a company’s own stock, including common stock warrants, to be designated
as an equity instrument or generally as a liability. A contract so designated is carried at fair value on a company’s balance sheet,
with any changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in a company’s results of operations.
The Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect any material changes
in fair value, with any such changes classified as changes in derivatives valuation in the statement of operations. The calculation of
the fair value of derivatives utilizes highly subjective and theoretical assumptions that can materially affect fair values from period
to period. The recognition of these derivative amounts does not have any impact on cash flows.
At the date
of the conversion of any convertible debt, the pro rata fair value of the related embedded derivative liability is transferred to additional
paid-in capital.
There
was no derivative activity in fiscal 2024 and 2023. Therefore, no derivative liabilities were recorded during the year ended September
30, 2024:

Debt Issuance Costs
Costs
incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are amortized over the term of the related debt and netted against the liability.
Commitments
and Contingencies
The Company
follows ASC 450-20 to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued,
which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The
Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company
evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief
sought or expected to be sought therein.
F-10
If the assessment
of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated,
then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the
contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss contingencies
considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management
does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially
and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
Income
Taxes
The Company
accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes pursuant to ASC
740, “Income Taxes.” Accordingly, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact
of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
The Company
records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the event
the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its recorded amount,
an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should
the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the
deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made.
The Company
is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and income taxes of various state tax jurisdictions. As the Company’s net operating losses
have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years remain open to examination by Federal authorities and other jurisdictions in which the
Company currently operates or has operated in the past. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits, as of September 30, 2024, and does
not anticipate any material amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
The Company
accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation,
and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP. The tax effects
of a position are recognized only if it is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting
date. If the tax position is not considered “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are
recognized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions. In subsequent periods,
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income tax expense.
On December
22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law. The Tax Reform Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
except for certain provisions, and resulted in significant changes to existing United States tax law, including various provisions that
are expected to impact the Company. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%
effective January 1, 2018. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Act during the year ended September
30, 2024. Given that current deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, these changes will have no impact on the balance
sheet.
The Company
is currently delinquent with respect to certain of its U.S. federal and state income tax filings.
Property
and Equipment
Property and
equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment
are included in the statement of operations when realized. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method
over a life of five years.
F-11
Intangible
Assets/Patents
We
capitalize external costs, such as filing fees and associated attorney fees, incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights.
We expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance in the period incurred. We amortize capitalized
patent costs for internally generated patents on a straight-line basis for 7 years, which represents the estimated useful lives
of the patents.
Long-Lived
Assets
The Company
periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or circumstances warrant such a review.
The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted
cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily by reference to the anticipated
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. No impairment charges have been recorded in the periods presented.
Stock-Based
Compensation
ASC 718, “Compensation
- Stock Compensation,” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
and non-employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options,
and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
and non-employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based
on their fair values on the grant date. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services
in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).
During the
year ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 27,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to members of the Board of Directors,
employees, and consultants. The fair value of the shares, as determined by reference to the closing price of the Company’s common
stock on each respective grant date, aggregated $296,675.
During the
year ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 46,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to members of the Board of Directors,
employees, and consultants. The fair value of the shares, as determined by reference to the closing price of the Company’s common
stock on each respective grant date, aggregated $291,600.
Total stock-based
compensation expense was $296,675 and $291,600 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share
The Company
computes basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.”
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of
common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
The common
share equivalents of these securities have not been included in the calculations of loss per share because such inclusions would have
an anti-dilutive effect as the Company has incurred losses during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
F-12
For the years
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the following common stock equivalents were potentially dilutive.

NOTE
4 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS/PATENTS
We
amortize capitalized patent costs for internally generated patents on a straight-line basis for 7 years, which represents the estimated
useful lives of the patents. The seven-year estimated useful life for internally generated patents is based on our assessment of
such factors as: the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed, the overall makeup of the portfolio over time, and the length
of license agreements for such patents. The estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights, however, have been and will
continue to be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally
generated patents. The average estimated useful life of acquired patents is 6.7 years. We assess the potential impairment to
all capitalized net patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patent portfolio may
not be recoverable.

assets are as follows:

of Specialty Material, and was paid with 31 million shares of GSTX common stock for the purchase. Subsequently the management and the
auditors evaluated this intangible asset by considering its useful life, future economic benefit, and amortization, decided a value of
US$6.5 million entered the book and reported in the 10K filing 2021. The delayed commercialization process for the past year prompted
the management to examine the short-term revenue generating prospect of this intangible assets and to consider and accept the recommendation

On
December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) resulting in significant modifications
to existing law including lowering the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in
2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses
previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet. The Company
has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the year ended September 30, 2024. Given that current deferred tax assets
are offset by a full valuation allowance, these changes will have no impact on the balance sheet.
At September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $4,878,863 and $19,929,277 respectively of the U.S. net operating losses (the “U.S. NOLs”),
which begin to expire beginning in 2039. NOLs generated in tax years prior to July 31, 2018, can be carryforward for twenty years, whereas
NOLs generated after July 31, 2018 can be carryforward indefinitely.

NOTE
9 – SALE OF US THIN-FILMS CORPORATION
On June 27, 2024, the Company sold its wholly
owned subsidiary, US Thin-Films Corporation, to Thin Film Technologies Ltd., a company controlled by Mr. David Halstead, a director of
the Company, for a total consideration of $1,000. As Thin Film Technologies Ltd. is a related party, this transaction is classified as
a related party transaction under applicable SEC regulations.
At the time of the sale, the subsidiary had
a net liability position of $1,645,819, which was deconsolidated from the Company’s balance sheet upon closing.
The disposal resulted in a gain of $1,646,819,
calculated as the difference between the net liabilities removed and the $1,000 sale price. In accordance with accounting guidance for
capital transactions with related parties, this gain was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s
consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity.
As a result of the sale, the operations of
US Thin-Films Corporation have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations.
The income and expenses of US Thin-Films Corporation have been removed from continuing operations and presented separately as a single
line item titled “Loss from discontinued operations” for both the current and prior periods.
As of September 30, 2024, the net loss from
discontinued operations totaled $103,308.
NOTE
10 – LEASES
The Company
maintains its principal office at 11201 North Tatum Blvd., Suite 300 Phoenix, AZ 85028. The Company moved in November 2023 and its office
is in a shared office space provider, at a cost of $278 per month and currently the lease is month-to-month.
Right of use
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease right of use asset also excludes lease incentives.
The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will
exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As part of the acquisition of Ausquartz Group
Holdings Pty Ltd on July 28, 2024, the Company assumed an existing lease for office and warehouse space located in Melbourne, Australia.
The lease commenced on November 1, 2023, with a four-year term and includes annual fixed rent increases of 4%.
The Company evaluated the lease and determined
that it should be classified as an operating lease, as none of the criteria for a finance lease were met. As of the lease commencement
date, the Company recorded a right-of-use (ROU) asset of $158,933 and a corresponding lease liability of $161,791, representing the present
value of future minimum lease payments. The present value was calculated using an incremental borrowing rate of 10%, which reflects the
Company’s estimated secured borrowing rate in a comparable economic environment and lease term.
As of September 30, 2024, the balance sheet
includes a ROU asset of $160,615 and lease liabilities of $164,245 related to this lease.
The future minimum payments on operating leases
for each of the next three years and in the aggregate amount to the following:

NOTE
11 – ACQUISITION OF AUSQUARTZ GROUP HOLDINGS PTY LTD
On
July 28, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with Henosis Limited (“the Seller”), pursuant
to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interest of Ausquartz Group Holdings Pty Ltd (“Ausquartz”),
an Australian-based developer of high purity quartz products used in the optic, solar, and semiconductor industries.
The
transaction was completed through the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Consideration Shares”)
to the Seller. The fair market value of the shares issued was $710,000, based on a price of $0.0071 per share as of the transaction date.
In connection with the transaction, the Company assumed a net liability of $169,503. As a result, the total compensation expense recognized
in connection with this transaction was $879,503, which was attributed to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Jason May.
Net
Liability Acquired is as follows:

Total Liabilities

Net Liability Acquired

The
Seller, Henosis Limited, is an entity associated with Mr. Jason May, making this a related party transaction under SEC rules. Due to
the related party nature of the transaction and its classification as a business collaboration, the Company did not record a step-up
in basis for the acquired assets and liabilities. The net assets of Ausquartz were recorded at the historical carrying value on the Seller’s
books.
The
acquisition of Ausquartz aligns with the Company’s long-term strategy to vertically integrate its supply chain for silicon wafer
production. High purity quartz is a critical input in the manufacturing of silicon wafers, and global supply of the material is highly
constrained. The addition of Ausquartz is expected to enhance the Company’s control over key raw materials necessary for semiconductor
and solar-related applications.

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
There are
no changes in nor disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. Effective for May 7, 2020, the firm of M&K
CPAS PLLC was engaged to serve as the new principal accountant to audit our financial statements. The decision to retain this accountant
for the years ended Sept 30, 2024 and 2023 was approved by our board of directors.
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
An evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K.
Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive [and Chief Financial Officer], or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the
framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in 2013 (“COSO”).
As of period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. The
Company’s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below:
Functional
Controls and Segregation of Duties
Because of
the Company’s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.
There is an
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s management is composed of a small number of
individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need
to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal
segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of
duty is feasible.
Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the
Company’s internal controls.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and implemented by our Board of Directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
15
Roger May,
our former Principal Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework (2013). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management
has been addressing any underlying causes for our weaknesses in internal control which may have occurred as a result of limited resources.
The Company has also engaged local accountants in Australia to assist Company management to prepare the Company’s financial statements.
