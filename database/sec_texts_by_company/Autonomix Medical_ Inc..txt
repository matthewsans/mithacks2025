This information was previously omitted from the Original 10-K in reliance on General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K, which permits the information in the above referenced items to be incorporated in the Original 10-K by reference from our definitive proxy statement so long as such proxy statement is filed no later than 120 days after our fiscal year-end. We are filing this Amendment No. 1 to include the Part III information in the Original Form 10-K.
This Amendment No. 1 amends and restates in their entirety Items 10 through 14 of the Original 10-K.

Accordingly, Item 15 of Part IV is amended to include the currently dated certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as exhibits. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amendment No. 1 and this Amendment No. 1 does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. In addition, because no financial statements are included in this Amendment No. 1, new certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are not required to be included with Amendment No. 1.
Except as described above, no other changes have been made to the Original 10-K. The Original 10-K continues to speak as of the date of the Original 10-K, and we have not updated the disclosures contained therein to reflect any events that have occurred as of a date subsequent to the date of the Original 10-K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original 10-K. Defined terms used, but not defined, herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Original 10-K.
Unless stated otherwise, references in this Amendment No. 1 to “Autonomix Medical,” or “the Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” are used herein to refer to Autonomix Medical, Inc.

Nomination of Director Candidates
We receive suggestions for potential director nominees from many sources, including members of the Board, advisors, and stockholders. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter states that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consider any director candidates recommended by our stockholders pursuant to the procedures set forth in our proxy statement, or made in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and the provisions of our charter documents. Any such nominations, together with appropriate biographical information, should be submitted to the Chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in the manner discussed below. Any candidates submitted by a stockholder or stockholder group are reviewed and considered in the same manner as all other candidates.
Qualifications for consideration as a Board nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a complement to the existing board composition. However, minimum qualifications include high level leadership experience in business activities, breadth of knowledge about issues affecting the Company, experience on other boards of directors, preferably public company boards, and time available for meetings and consultation on Company matters. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates but seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the background, skills and expertise to make a significant contribution to the Board, to the Company and our stockholders. Candidates whose evaluations are favorable are recommended by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the full Board for consideration. The full Board selects and recommends candidates for nomination as directors for stockholders to consider and vote upon at the annual meeting.

Table of Contents
A stockholder wishing to nominate a candidate for election to our Board of Directors at any annual meeting at which the Board of Directors has determined that one or more directors will be elected must submit a written notice of his or her nomination of a candidate to the Chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (c/o the Corporate Secretary), providing the candidates name, biographical data and other relevant information together with a consent from the nominee. Pursuant to our Bylaws, the submission must be received at our principal executive offices 120 days prior to the anniversary date of our previous year’s proxy statement so as to permit the Board of Directors time to evaluate the qualifications of the nominee.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our Bylaws, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than our nominees must comply with the additional requirements of Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act to comply with the universal proxy rules. The requirements under the universal proxy rules are in addition to the applicable procedural requirements under our Bylaws described above.
Stockholder Communications with Directors
Persons wishing to write to our Board of Directors, or to a specified director or committee of the Board, should send correspondence to the Corporate Secretary at 21 Waterway Avenue, Suite 300, The Woodlands, Texas 77380. Electronic submissions of stockholder correspondence will not be accepted.
The Corporate Secretary will forward to the directors all communications that, in his or her judgment, are appropriate for consideration by the directors. Examples of communications that would not be appropriate for consideration by the directors include commercial solicitations and matters not relevant to the stockholders, to the functioning of the Board or to the affairs of the Company. Any correspondence received that is addressed generically to the Board of Directors will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Board.
Anti-Hedging Policy
Our policies prohibit directors, officers and other employees from purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engaging in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of our equity securities without our prior approval.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a written code of ethics that applies to our directors, principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and any persons performing similar functions. The code of ethics is on the “Investors - Corporate Governance” section of our web site at https://ir.autonomix.com/corporate-governance. We intend to disclose any future amendments to, or waivers from, the code of ethics within four business days of the waiver or amendment through a website posting or by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.
Insider Trading Policy
Our Board has adopted an Insider Trading Policy that applies to all of our directors, executive officers, and employees. The policy attempts to establish standards that will avoid even the appearance of improper conduct on the part of insiders by requiring, among other things, that insiders maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in the Company’s securities while aware of material nonpublic information. Our insider trading policy was filed as Exhibit 19 to the original Annual Report of Form 10-K filed on May 29, 2025.
Delinquent Section 16(A) Reports
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock to file reports with the SEC disclosing their ownership of common stock at the time they become subject to Section 16(a) and changes in such ownership that occur during the year. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports furnished to us, or on written representations that no reports were required, we believe that all directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of the common stock complied in a timely manner with the filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during the year ended March 31, 2025, other than one Form 4 by David Robins reporting one transaction that was filed on July 26, 2024.

Employment Agreements
Brad Hauser Employment Agreement
On June 17, 2024, we entered into an employment agreement with Brad Hauser pursuant to which Mr. Hauser agreed to serve as our chief executive officer and president for an initial three-year period, which may be extended on a year-to-year basis. Mr. Hauser’s agreement provides for an initial annual base salary of $450,000 (subject to an annual review and increase at the discretion of our Compensation Committee) and a target annual bonus of 60% of his base salary. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Hauser was granted a ten-year option (the “Inducement Options”) to purchase 45,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of the employment agreement. The option vests in four equal annual installments (or 11,250 shares each installment) on each of the succeeding four anniversary dates of the execution of the employment agreement, provided Mr. Hauser is employed by us on each vesting date. In the event of a “change of control” or the termination of the agreement by us without “cause” or by Mr. Hauser for “good reason,” all of the unvested options shall immediately vest. The Inducement Options were granted outside of our 2023 Stock Plan as an inducement material to Mr. Hauser’s entering into employment with us in accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Commencing with the year ending March 31, 2025, Mr. Hauser will be eligible to receive annual option grants as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, based on criteria established by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares underlying the target annual option grant will be equal to $1,000,000 divided by the Black-Scholes value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.

Lori Bisson – Employment Agreement
On June 17, 2024, we entered into an employment agreement with Lori Bisson pursuant to which Ms. Bisson agreed to serve as our Executive Vice Chair and Strategic Adviser to the Chief Executive Officer (“Vice Chair”) for a two-year period.

Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table
We have established for compensation purposes a compensation year that matches our fiscal year that ends March 31. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, our Compensation Committee completes its annual review of executive compensation and determines, after researching comparable companies, the compensation arrangements for the next compensation year.
We review compensation annually for all employees, including our executives. In setting executive base salaries and bonuses and granting equity incentive awards, we consider compensation for comparable positions in the market, the individual executive’s performance as compared to our expectations and objectives, our desire to motivate our employees to achieve short and long-term results that are in the best interests of our stockholders and a long-term commitment to our company. We do not target a specific competitive position or a specific mix of compensation among base salary, bonus or long-term incentives. Our Compensation Committee typically reviews and discusses management’s proposed compensation with the Chief Executive Officer for all executives other than the Chief Executive Officer. Based on those discussions and its discretion, the Compensation Committee then determines the compensation for each executive officer. Our Compensation Committee, without members of management present, discusses and ultimately approves the compensation of our executive officers.
Annual Base Salary
For the 2025 fiscal year, the annual base salaries for Ms. Bisson, Dr. Schwartz, Mr. Toth, Mr. Smith, Mr. Klemp and Mr. Hauser were $375,000, $100,000, $137,500, $285,000 and $450,000, respectively. Upon Ms. Bisson's change in responsibilities in June 2024, her annual base salary was reduced to $150,000. For the 2026 fiscal year, the base salaries for Ms. Bisson, Dr. Schwartz, Mr. Toth, Mr. Smith, Mr. Klemp and Mr. Hauser will be $150,000, $50,000, $50,000, $296,400, $50,000 and $468,000, respectively.
Annual Bonus and Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.
We seek to motivate and reward our executives for achievements relative to our corporate goals and objectives, and with respect to their respective individual goals, for each fiscal year. For the last fiscal year, the target bonus for Ms. Bisson, Dr. Schwartz, Mr. Toth, Mr. Smith, Mr. Klemp and Mr. Hauser were 50%, 35%, 0%, 40%, 0% and 60%, respectively, of their base salary. For the 2026 fiscal year, the target bonus each year for Ms. Bisson, Dr. Schwartz, Mr. Toth, Mr. Smith, Mr. Klemp and Mr. Hauser are 50%, 35%, 0%, 40%, 0%, and 60% respectively, of their base salary.
The actual performance-based annual bonus paid is calculated by multiplying the executive’s annual base salary, target bonus percentage, the percentage attainment of the corporate goals established by the Board for such year, which represents the total potential bonus payable to our named executive officers, and the percentage attainment of the individual goals approved by our Compensation Committee with respect to our other executive officers. However, the Compensation Committee is not required to calculate bonuses in this manner and retains discretion in the amounts it awards and the factors it takes into consideration in determining bonus amounts. At the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee reviews our performance against our goals and objectives and approves the extent to which we achieved each of our corporate and individual goals and objectives, and, for each named executive officer, the amount of the bonus awarded.

Table of Contents
For the last fiscal year, bonuses were awarded based on our achievement of specified corporate goals, including securing strategic partnerships, progress on our pivotal trial, completion of financings and completion of the ongoing clinical proof of concept trial. These corporate goals accounted for 100% of our base line bonuses. In addition, our Compensation Committee specified a series of "stretch goals," that, if achieved, would result in an additional 20%. Based on the level of achievement, our Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Bisson, Dr. Schwartz, Mr. Smith and Mr. Hauser 95%, respectively, of their potential bonuses for the year. These actual bonus amounts are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table above.
For the 2026 fiscal year, bonuses will be awarded based on our achievement of specified corporate goals, including securing strategic partnerships, progress on our pivotal trial, completion of financings, design lock for catheter and completion of the second phase of the clinical proof of concept trial. These corporate goals account for 100% of our base line bonuses. In addition, our Compensation Committee specified a series of “stretch goals,” that, if achieved, would result in an additional 20%.
Long-Term Incentives
Our 2023 Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock awards, stock unit awards and stock appreciation rights to key employees, non-employee directors and consultants.
Each year our Compensation Committee establishes a value for the expected equity grant issuable to each of our named executive officers. For options, we typically set the option exercise price and grant date fair value based on the closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq on the date of grant, however, there may be instances where we may use an average closing price, up to five days, to set the option exercise price. The shares underlying options typically vest in four equal annual installments. For other equity awards, the grant date fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq on the date of grant.
As of July 25, 2025, no equity grants for Ms. Bisson, Mr. Smith, Mr. Klemp and Mr. Hauser have been granted for fiscal year 2026. The final determination for any equity grants remain at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

Director Compensation
13
Table of Contents
Commencing upon the closing of our IPO in January 2024, our non-employee directors began to receive annual compensation of $50,000. In May 2024, the Board of Directors approved an updated non-employee director compensation plan, pursuant to which upon the initial appointment (or election) of an non-employee director to the Board, the non-employee director shall be issued a 10-year option to purchase 3,750 shares of the Company’s common stock, under the 2023 Stock Plan, that will vest in three equal annual installments over a three-year period. In addition, on the date of our annual meeting, each non-employee director that is re-elected at the Annual Shareholder Meeting will be issued a 10-year option to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, under the 2023 Stock Plan that will vest quarterly over a one-year period. In addition, each non-employee director will receive an annual compensation of $40,000 and special service pay amounts based on service for committee responsibilities as follows: Audit Committee Chair - $15,000; Compensation Committee Chair - $10,000; and Nominating and Governance Chair - $7,500.

These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be realized by the director. For a summary of the assumptions made in the valuation of the awards, please see Note 4 to our financial statements as of and for the period ended March 31, 2025 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 29, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate number of shares outstanding under all options to purchase our common stock held by our non-employee directors were: Mr. Capelli – 3,750 shares.
Recoupment Policy
We adopted the Autonomix Medical, Inc. Dodd-Frank Restatement Recoupment Policy. In the event that we are required to prepare a financial restatement, the Committee will recoup all erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation calculated on a pre-tax basis, by a person (i) after beginning service as an executive officer, (ii) who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation, and (iii) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a restatement, and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. “clawback” or recoupment policy in our executive compensation program contributes to creating and maintaining a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and reinforces the performance-based principles underlying our executive compensation program.
Granting of Certain Equity Awards Close in Time to the Release of Material Nonpublic Information
We do not grant equity awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock, and do not time the public release of such information based on award grant dates. During the last completed fiscal year, we have not made awards to any named executive officer during the period beginning four business days before and ending one business day after the filing of a period report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K or the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form 8-K, and we have not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Risks from Compensation Policies and Practices
Our Compensation Committee reviews our compensation policies and practices to determine areas of potential risks and the actions we have taken, or should take, to mitigate any such identified risks. Based on the Compensation Committee’s review of our compensation policies and practices, we do not believe that any risks relating to our compensation policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 13.         Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
In December 2021, we granted a company affiliated with certain early investors in the Company a license to our technology for use in the field of cardiology. In July 2023, we entered into a termination agreement for the license agreement in exchange for the issuance, upon the closing of our IPO, of a warrant to purchase 80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share. One of our directors, David Robins, holds a 19.5% interest in the company receiving the warrant.
In September 2023, we commenced a private placement for up to $2.0 million in principal amount of convertible notes with a maturity date of December 31, 2025. For each dollar in principal amount of convertible notes purchased, we issued a warrant to purchase 0.0125 shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $20.00 per share. On the closing of our IPO, the principal amount of the convertible notes converted into our common stock at a conversion price of $40.00 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, members of the Company’s management, Board of Directors and an immediate family member of the Company’s management, collectively purchased $500,000 ($400,000 (for management and members of the Board of Directors) and $100,000 (for the immediate family member of the Company's management, respectively) in principal amount of convertible notes in the private placement.
Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions
Our audit committee charter provides that our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving in advance any related party transaction. This will cover, with certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which we were or will be a participant to, where the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, including, without limitation, purchases of goods or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness and employment by us of a related person. In determining whether to approve a proposed transaction, our audit committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances including: (i) the materiality and character of the related party’s direct or indirect interest; (ii) the commercial reasonableness of the terms; (iii) the benefit or perceived benefit, or lack thereof, to us; (iv) the opportunity cost of alternate transactions; and (v) the actual or apparent conflict of interest of the related party.

Director Independence
The rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Nasdaq Rules, require a majority of a listed company’s board of directors to be composed of independent directors. In addition, the Nasdaq Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees be independent. Under the Nasdaq Rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq Rules also require that audit committee members satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. In considering the independence of compensation committee members, the Nasdaq Rules require that our board of directors must consider additional factors relevant to the duties of a compensation committee member, including the source of any compensation we pay to the director and any affiliations with our company.
Our board of directors undertook a review of the composition of our board of directors and its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Ms. Bisson and Mr. Klemp, are independent as defined under the Nasdaq Rules.
