Verses
AI Inc. (the “Company”) is unable, without unreasonable effort or expense, to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended March 31, 2025 (the “2025 Form 10-K”) within the prescribed time period as result of the Company having limited
internal resources and no previous reporting experience filing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Since prior April 1, 2025, the Company qualified as a “foreign private issuer” as defined under Rule 3b-4 under
the Exchange Act, the 2025 Form 10-K is the first Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed by the Company, and consequently the Company’s
internal team will require more time to complete the necessary disclosures (and supporting materials) required to be included in the
2025 Form 10-K, including, but not limited to, the information required to be disclosed under Part III of Form 10-K, since the Company
does not intend to file a definitive proxy statement within 120 days of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. The Company expects to
file the 2025 Form 10-K within the 15-day extension period (the “Extension Period”) afforded by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange.
Forward-Looking
Statement
This
Form 12b-25 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable United States securities laws. These forward looking
statements include: (i) statements regarding the Company’s expectation to file the 2025 Form 10-K within the Extension Period,
and (ii) statements regarding the Company’s financial results for the year ended March 31, 2025. Forward-looking statements are
based on management’s current expectations or beliefs about the Company’s future plans, expectations and objectives. These
forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to
differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Readers of this Form 12b-25 are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Form 12b-25.
